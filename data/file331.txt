3310018 het voelde alsof ik werd gestraft omdat ik het had aangedurfd de verkrachting aan te klagen het leek wel alsof we weer in de jaren 70 waren en men mij verweet dat ik erom had gevraagd hoe zou je die brief anders kunnen opvatten dan dat het mijn fout was

3310020 memory seems to be made up mostly of still pictures
3310021 i know that thanks to a big flickr kerfuffle last year gawker media sites are only supposed to use photos on that site that have appropriate creative commons licensing
3310022 historically her footprint was primarily on the west coast but i would say in the last five years she has expanded her footprint to a national level and in the last two years has really put a lot of distance between herself and competitors
3310023 i would estimate that 60 to 70 of all big pitches are going to her
3310024 she seems to have grabbed the market from boston based pile amp co in my mind they are less active or at least publicly active
3310025 you have some old school consultants who are really good people but they dont present themselves well when they go head to head
3310026 catherine is a pretty sharp lady she presents herself well shes got an agency background and has hired a couple people who do too so they do very well
3310027 rigor of their process and ability to implement an agency selection process that was comprehensive effective and efficient
3310028 its not a required part of our process we take a very firm position that we will not solicit or sign up agencies at the start of a review
3310029 the budgets especially for traditional advertising keep shrinking and clients want more for the buck they pay in addition the cost of talent is rising to the point of an unreasonable level
3310030 lack of understanding a friend of mine who was a traditional art director said that he thought interactive was cheap and quick in reality its expensive and time consuming many people lack a decent understanding of what it takes to do interactive work
3310031 there are really two main concerns cost and quality when it comes to cost and interactive production there really are two extremes at play one extreme is that you have interactive productions that require the same high end special effects and quality that television requires there still is a huge misconception that because the production is going to be on the web it is going to be cheaper in fact the cost will most likely increase because in addition you now need to make that content interactive on the other extreme you have concepts that require a streamlined cost effective method of production that means having people on the team who wear more than one hat the new term preditor producer shooter editor describes this new emerging group of filmmakers
3310032 in general ive noticed a healthy influx of interactive capabilities one stop shop content makers and other longer form talent like episodic television directors now being represented though commercial production companies then there are support services like digital and graphic design in house editorial ancillary production work on a wish level id like to see more a directorial talent take a greater part in online projects even if its not profitable now
3310033 yes of course as the definition of interactive marketing gets bigger there will be a lot more specialists there are already some excellent interactive production companies that only do installations or mobile or 3 d or games and there are some giant ones doing massive productions of banners i think it will fragment and actually make it much easier for agencies to go back to being brand agents and there will be a wealth of specialists to make it easier to get good work done
3310034 it would be great to explore how we facilitate collaboration right now we are still very much in the hands off mind set i would love combined teams in one space where we generate and evolve on the job we might even learn something along the way can you imagine the fresh ideas that could come from that level of interaction

3310044 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3310045 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3310046 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3310050 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3310051 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3310067 these graves reveal istanbul used to be home to some of the earliest types of settlements during the stone age when people migrated from anatolia to the european continent
3310068 they also show that the marmara sea used to be a small and shallow water in ancient times

3310070 apparently it was an improvised explosive device that hit the bus
3310071 the east west energy corridor and turkey being an energy hub for the west is one of the principal arguments of turkey in its application for the eu and the need to have a good relationship with turkey
3310072 this conflict casts a shadow over turkeys foreign policy platform of creating an area of stability
3310073 this conflict could strengthen the argument for the west that if turkey is outside the tent it could create a lot of difficulties for the eu
3310074 so from the eu point of view it would make sense to bring turkey into the tent
3310075 there is also a concern that if turkey is part of the eu you are bringing the eus border to georgia and to the rest of the caucasus which might not go well in continental europe
3310076 we want stability in the region and to see fighting stop as soon as possible there is fire in the neighbors house
3310077 turkey doesnt want this war but it has had a difficult job adjusting its foreign policy towards russia and georgia
3310078 there are broader strategic considerations in this conflict turkey needs to be cautious

3310080 these are some of the moves musharraf has so far finalised in his parleys with legal experts q league politicians and his sponsors abroad there are other options still being thrashed out for inclusion on the list
3310081 we are aware of all conspiracies musharraf is hatching let him do whatever he does he is only shooting at his own foot we are not deterred from our move to impeach him come what may musharraf is doomed to face the masses wrath we shall politically deal with whatever moves he makes where we are unable to stop him and hit back politically and legally the loss is to be incurred by musharraf and not us
3310082 any moment within these 72 hours is critical i can say that the loser is going to be the ruling ppp ml n coalition at least in the first phase the punjab governor is set to ask shahbaz sharif to seek a vote of confidence after the presidents move to destabilise him yields some results in this chaos anything can happen
3310083 it was deemed essential to give the resolution tabling process a political and moral tempo via resolutions in the provincial assemblies in support of impeachment but whatever the presidential quarters conceive and do would be harmful to them and not to us let him take whatever action he can we are not going to be the losers we win politically and morally his fate is going to be decided this way or that in this process
3310084 the present doha round of talks was different than the previous ones as many changes have taken place in the political and economic architecture of the world since then
3310085 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit

3310087 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3310088 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3310089 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3310090 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3310091 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3310092 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3310093 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3310094 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3310095 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3310096 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3310097 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3310098 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3310099 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3310100 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3310101 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3310102 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3310103 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3310104 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3310105 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3310106 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3310107 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3310108 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3310109 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3310110 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3310111 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3310112 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3310113 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3310114 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3310115 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3310116 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
3310117 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
3310118 ive no doubt that shaun woodward is eager for promotion and would happily see the job of secretary of state abolished but we are equally sure that northern ireland needs to be properly represented around the cabinet table
3310119 the northern ireland executive has not met in ages and the political institutions are still weak so to suggest abolishing the cabinet position of secretary of state for northern ireland is extremely foolish in addition as owen paterson has pointed out there is a job of work going forward the institutions need further refinement and it is important that there is a significant cabinet figure to oversee those developments mr paterson has also maintained that given the close links with the irish republic and the interest in northern ireland in the us it is important that the position of secretary of state for northern ireland is retained
3310120 two days ago i was pessimistic yesterday i was extremely carefully optimistic and today i am just carefully optimistic
3310121 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3310122 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3310123 if i progress in my events i only have 12 races in nine days the way i look at it is ive had lots and lots of practice
3310124 i didnt feel great going into this meet i had very very strong training but for whatever reason the last few days before the meet i wasnt feeling as strong
3310125 but i was able to get my head together and swim well today a lot of it was in my head
3310126 the 100 back has been progressing faster than any other female event and for me to win gold in such a strong strong event im so proud
3310127 which was probably why i was crying like a little baby on the awards stand i was really overwhelmed with emotion
3310128 following recent media reports of significant civilian casualties isaf has now concluded a thorough investigation of the claim and has evidence that those killed were insurgents
3310129 still under observation they then moved to an open field where they were attacked and killed by shots from an isaf aircraft
3310130 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaeda
3310131 there are many foreign elements there more than local militants
3310132 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3310133 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3310134 i seen all the cars backed up and i came out to see what was going on
3310135 we are still going to get beat up on this one way or another
3310136 they expect to make sacrifices and they choose to make sacrifices
3310137 your job is to try to moderate some of those differences
3310138 unless you have a spouse who works full time or you are retired its difficult to serve
3310139 it seems a risky gamble to say that if oil prices fall air service will be back
3310140 its very troubling what we have to do is search out the answers
3310141 if we did wed be all over it well know more when the state police finish their investigation and well see where that leads us
3310142 weve had such a focus on forensics it tends not to get as much attention
3310143 a lot of people around town are saying this was the best one
3310144 its disappointing theyve gone down two years in a row
3310145 one of the things we want to kind of investigate is to see if the city is going to ask for any traffic betterments because of the group home
3310146 i have confidence theyre going to do a good job but were new into the project
3310147 it will serve some needs in the community and hopefully use the park a little bit more have some more eyes on the park the more people that use woodmansee park the better
3310148 we want our projects to help enhance their social standing and their dignity so they feel good about where theyre going to live and with whom theyre going to live
3310149 at this point releasing details could hamper the detectives work
3310150 the most important thing right now is finding out exactly what happened and bringing to justice those that need it
3310151 weve seen a rise in tagging but nothing of major proportions
3310152 anytime you have an incident like this it upsets people
3310153 this is an extremely safe place to live and this was an isolated incident i think thats an important point to stress
3310154 its not clear to me that this is gang related its speculation at this point it may or may not be its important not to label things too prematurely
3310155 i can copy him but i dont think i could be as good as phelps
3310156 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3310157 this is what i will do this is what i wont do this is what i will not allow in my life this is what i will not allow you to say to me this is what i will not allow you to do to me this is what i will accept from you this is what i wont accept from you
3310158 they want to have an experience to be immersed in something
3310159 its not a question of how many canteens are here but what does this one canteen mean
3310160 i admit that cycling does have a problem and we have to deal with that
3310161 we are catching cheats but thats mainly because we are
3310162 the uci has been one of the leading international federations in the fight against doping which is not the case of some bigger federations
3310163 weve been doing blood tests on the riders for years in comparison fifa the international football federation only began doing blood tests last year
3310164 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
3310165 i will be hoping to talk with the wada chief while i am here and im sure well have plenty to discuss
3310166 the uci is comparatively small compared to athletics and football but we are at the forefront of the doping fight we have pioneered the biological passport scheme which is costing five million euros to launch and which is going forward
3310167 first of all its not the wada chiefs decision whether we stay in the olympics or not
3310168 and i dont believe you should punish a sport because it is finding cheats
3310169 he rogge has stated publicly in the past that he supports us
3310170 we have had nothing but support from the ioc even from the ioc medical commission who understand what we are trying to do
3310171 why sometimes ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast

3310179 the ati radeon hd 4800 x2 series is proof that our graphics strategy is working the response from oems system integrators game developers press and most importantly from gamers regarding the ati radeon hd 4800 series products has been incredibly positive
3310180 now only a few short weeks after the launch of those products amd reclaims the ultimate performance crown and continues to deliver winning products to market in the ati radeon hd 4800 x2 series
3310181 i thought that at the end of the day quality would win
3310182 we would like to think that if something is made well it ought to be able to pay for itself
3310183 you have a 99 percent chance of being a failure if you are an independent film
3310184 all of a sudden all these beekeeping societies started contacting us wanting buy videos and book screenings
3310185 i realized that if beekeepers are a community there are an infinite number of communities any number of films can be marketed to
3310186 we used to say that mediocrity will be punished now the good will be punished you have to be very good or great or you will die
3310187 ive never seen more depressed people in my life than i did in cannes last month
3310188 it will feel like we just survived a medieval plague the carnage and the stench will be overwhelming
3310189 in this darwinian new future there will absolutely be a premium for good films on tv pay per view on demand internet or whatever that large pipe that goes to all of our houses will be called
3310190 ive made this piece of art you can find it between the mentos experiment and the sleeping cat
3310191 whats interesting about collaborations is the possibility for one plus one to equal three
3310192 its interesting for me to sell comme des gar ons in places its never been sold before to people who might not have heard of comme des gar ons
3310193 am auzit multe plangeri de la cei care isi strangeau separat deseurile insa cand ajungeau la pubela vedeau ca nu au unde sa le depoziteze separat
3310194 pentru ca lucrurile se misca mai alert si oamenii au inceput sa fie constienti
3310195 am fost contactati in special de firme pentru a le indruma catre centre de colectare a hartiei s au aratat interesate si persoane fizice insa mai putin
3310196 unii locuitori sunt dezamagiti pentru ca nu exista o continuitate a acestui proces incearca sa isi colecteze separat deseurile insa la ghena nu exista clopote separate deci nu au unde sa le puna
3310197 in localitatile mai mici procesul este mult mai simplu legaturile se fac mai rapid
3310198 given the heightened expectations over such a move the longer the government waits before making its plans known one way or the other the more housing market activity could be hit as people wait to see what will happen
3310199 any further slowdown in already very weak housing market activity would be liable to add to the downward pressure on prices
3310200 the gap between the two sides is just too wide
3310201 the associations demands are simply not possible for us to meet
3310202 its the largest example of lack of respect to our contribution to safety

3310231 there will be no significant material and economic progress in muslim communities until the muslim mind is allowed to challenge the status quo of muslim conventions and even their most cherished shibboleths

3310233 the koran remains for all muslims not just fundamentalists the uncreated word of god himself it is valid for all times and places its ideas are absolutely true and beyond all criticism to question it is to question the very word of god and hence blasphemous a muslims duty is to believe it and obey its divine commands

3310247 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
3310248 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
3310249 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
3310250 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
3310251 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
3310252 the key is choice and google has taken away that choice and is developing android like every other piece of closed software
3310253 rather than trying to push yet another platform google ought to be bringing the market together and building applications which is where theyre going to make their money
3310254 the developer discontent is just part of what has turned out to be a flawed strategy
3310255 its the very same reason why apple didnt do third party developers first and thats to assure the process and the program and the quality thats initially being offered
3310256 they re pretty sure they can get 50 quality applications
3310257 the community must not forget that google is dealing with partners in the cell phone industry and they certainly have a reputation of a closed source tight lipped mentality
3310258 the community can cry foul if google releases the newest sdk to developers a week before handsets hit the stores but as far as i have heard that is far from the truth
3310259 within the next six months symbian and android will combine into a single open source os
3310260 on the other hand it would be much easier to do now than to tackle it in the future when developers are that much farther down the road
3310261 to tie symbian and android together would require an awful lot of heavy lifting between google and nokia and to do that kind of an agreement would be problematic
3310262 it would have been easier while symbian was small and independent but now that symbian is basically a subsidiary of nokia it s going to be pretty difficult
3310263 if you develop for apple youve got a ready market
3310264 if you develop for android its a crapshoot because theres no assurance that the android platform is even going to sell
3310265 while google does simple well this is googles first device as opposed to apple which clearly has been doing devices for a while
3310266 apple is treating developers terribly and really undermining the community
3310267 the fact that applications have to go through the in order to be distributed really shows how much control apple has over the entire os
3310268 at the end of the day developers want to make money
3310269 so theyre going to develop on a platform and put resources on a platform that will make them money
3310270 undoubtedly some developers have written android off and will never return
3310271 lots arent paying a darn bit of attention to the whole mess because there arent any devices ready yet
3310272 people think im really confident but i do get self conscious like many women about stripping off in public
3310273 i havent been willingly photographed in a bikini for seven years and i dont think ill do it again
3310274 at the moment im a bit curvier having done the tour so it was a big mental step forward for me to show my natural self rather than my worked out honed self
3310275 i did strive to have my most perfect body and in moments when i lack confidence that voice is always there waiting to tell me you are not good enough do better but im more conscious of it
3310276 i was disappointed that the producers didnt have the courtesy to tell me first
3310277 i think his looks have hindered him not in terms of the parts hes got but in terms of what people think of him
3310278 hes great fun he jokes around all the time and has a real quality about him on set the director called me over and said jase just watch him watch him move instead of walking brad literally glides its incredible
3310279 the whole point of what we were meaning to do was having our best performances
3310280 this has added more attention on myself and put more stress on me
3310281 how its interpreted its always going to vary there was no malicious intent there
3310282 i know mike on his blog was getting hate mail
3310283 he would be reading that every day and we had to take his blackberry away from him he kept reading that and he would get all depressed and angry
3310284 there were people saying way to go american and way to do stupid things
3310285 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
3310286 the thing about the masks is that theyre usoc issued masks so the fact that the usoc didnt back them it just wasnt very cool
3310287 no location has been secured for any of the t stops
3310288 which would be more convenient for people to be dropped off and picked up
3310289 a really key issue is how well this station is going to serve potential development
3310290 whereas in areas where youve already got 90 to 95 percent of the population youre ever going to have such as lowell street you need to design for the existing population
3310291 its a concept plan at that time so its still subject to nuances
3310292 so we should see some pretty good alternatives by september which will be reformed as time goes on
3310293 shall illustrate how the stigma of being a single mother still exists in
3310294 truly happy man whose bright future was cut tragically short
3310295 anyone who met jo knew that he was a decent fun loving person close to his many friends
3310296 the family are so proud of what jo achieved in a life that has been cut so tragically short we all miss him so much
3310297 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3310298 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3310299 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3310300 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3310301 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3310302 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3310303 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3310304 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3310305 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3310306 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3310307 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3310308 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3310309 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3310310 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3310311 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3310312 ten dead bodies and 11 injured have been brought here
3310313 so far according to my information it was a security vehicle and an ied improvised explosive device was planted under the bridge
3310314 unha das soluci ns que recolle a lei a expropiaci n
3310315 well it always sucked so i guess ill just wait until they fix it
3310316 well thats okay i can send a text message via my phone until the service comes back online in a few hours
3310317 i had some doubts about seeing a female therapist ive always had troubles with male bosses because i had a terrible relationship with my father now im having troubles with two female bosses i feel like i am working for out of control mommies if my therapist treats me in the same way it will be a problem for me
3310318 another issue is that i became fascinated with psychotherapy when i was in my 20s because i felt i wasnt a very functional human being i read freud i became fascinated with b f skinner because he advocated positive reinforcement and i wanted to do better with my child than my parents had done with me then i read fritz perls first book and became fascinated with gestalt therapy i saw perls give a public exhibition of a treatment he was brilliant but very scary i dont know if they would allow a therapist to do that today i dont know if it is ethical
3310319 at the least the patient would have to sign a whole bunch of release forms
3310320 it was the 70s it was a crazy time i went into a gestalt encounter group where i had a powerful experience
3310321 i dont know if a patient who has a lot of superficial knowledge about psychotherapy and can speak psychobabble is very irritating to you
3310322 your employers contract provides for three sessions then you dont get any more
3310323 since my employer is driving me crazy its only fair that they provide some free therapy my hmo offers some low cost therapy ive used it before i can always go back to them after i use up my three sessions with you
3310324 a few years ago i was diagnosed with clinical depression i had some therapy with them i saw an msw bonnis credential as well a psychiatrist and i had some group therapy
3310325 no i am very reluctant to take psychotropic drugs my psychiatrist offered me some but i turned her down
3310326 tell me about your problems with your job what would help you
3310327 i am nine months from retirement if you said heres a new job that would last nine months i would be happier do you believe an organization can be mentally ill can that description apply to a group
3310328 my wife is not working right now she wants me to keep my medical coverage if i retire before i go under medicare i will have to get cobra thats very expensive
3310329 my wife and i had a very cold weekend she feels
3310330 you mean you dont think that psychiatry is a science
3310331 i worked in a mental hospital for a while they did a lot of electroshock sometimes a patient seemed to improve but i certainly didnt like the use of this treatment or like seeing it used
3310332 we dont care if you say these words but they bother some people please dont say them to your grandmas or when you go to kindergarten
3310333 for example the wind industry it was nothing in the 1970s today one third of all terrestrial wind turbines in the world come from denmark
3310334 we got 99 percent of our energy from the middle east today it is zero
3310335 i have observed that in all other countries including in america people are complaining about how prices of gasoline are going up
3310336 the cure is not to reduce the price but on the contrary to raise it even higher to break our addiction to oil we are going to introduce a new tax reform in the direction of even higher taxation on energy and the revenue generated on that will be used to cut taxes on personal income so we will improve incentives to work and improve incentives to save energy and develop renewable energy
3310337 my employer seems to be very afraid of bad things happening
3310338 thats a concern of course but my main concern is for you some of my patients are well crazy and i dont always spot that right away i want to help you and do whats best for you thats the main reason i ask these questions
3310339 that strikes me as a reasonable answer i am not sure my bosses can tell the difference between reasonable concerns such as that and irrationally clinging to obsessive bureaucracy
3310340 its a good thing my car is an old wreck and its almost worn out its probably not worth fussing with you should be more careful
3310341 voil exactement pourquoi je fuierai toujours apple ok ils ont de belles b cannes

3310346 in our view us supply last year should have been somewhere between 720 000 900 000 units per month 40 50 per cent of total units produced but nintendo chose instead to divert a significant portion of its available supply to europe since april 2007 as the weak dollar has made us sales less profitable for the company than european sales
3310347 final fantasy iv is one of the most significant titles in the history of the final fantasy franchise
3310348 it has been remarkably enhanced for the nintendo ds making it a great opportunity for our fans to experience its deep story and ground breaking battle system in an exciting and innovative new way
3310349 s billigt kan det g res p pc versus mac
3310350 of course were incredibly pleased delighted would probably be a better adjective that nintendo approached us but its not an exclusive relationship
3310351 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
3310352 parents attach to children through core level dreams fantasies illusions and projections into the future disability dashes these cherished dreams the impairment not the child irreversibly spoils a parents fundamental heart felt yearning as disability bluntly shatters the dreams parents face a complicated draining challenging frightening and consuming task they must raise the child they have while letting go of the child they dreamed of they must go on with their lives cope with their child as he or she is now let go of the lost dreams and generate new dreams to do all this the parent must experience the process of grieving

3310357 these are some of the moves musharraf has so far finalised in his parleys with legal experts q league politicians and his sponsors abroad there are other options still being thrashed out for inclusion on the list
3310358 we are aware of all conspiracies musharraf is hatching let him do whatever he does he is only shooting at his own foot we are not deterred from our move to impeach him come what may musharraf is doomed to face the masses wrath we shall politically deal with whatever moves he makes where we are unable to stop him and hit back politically and legally the loss is to be incurred by musharraf and not us

3310385 been issued for an improper purpose such as to harass the taxpayer
3310386 such blatant and invasive actions go far beyond the level of simply referring a matter to the justice department the point at which the irs would no longer have authority to issue a summons
3310387 these actions reflect an alternative agenda that goes beyond a simple criminal query
3310388 they also reflect that the summonses were issued in bad faith
3310389 even if the irs has authority to issue a summons when it is conducting a criminal investigation the irs is not permitted to harass hogan or put pressure on him to settle a criminal dispute
3310390 the australian tax authorities have reason to believe that hogan may have failed to properly report all taxable items on some or all the australian income tax returns that he filed for the years 2000 to 2007

3310419 there is no god all there is is power and we have to wield it just as brutally as those who once oppressed us because global ethical standards of human rights and respect for the other are all an unrealistic fantasy the world is governed by the powerful thats what is thats what always will be thats the reality of the world that we cannot be expected to change so get off our backs with all that ethical crap and be realistic which is to say lets us dominate as much as we want for as long as we can
3310420 were just being realistic this is how the world is and you either end up winning or losing so were going to be winner in it
3310421 they are not about the real world of capital they are for our private lives
3310422 its really the story about waking up so that you are not lulled to sleep by all of this propaganda
3310423 principe ormai tutto perduto tutto travolto dal vento abbiamo perduto tutto
3310424 principessa non esiste una cosa nella tua vita per la quale valga la pena di perdere tutto
3310425 we need strong pro immigrant and migrant art to confront the multitude of images of disempowerment given to us by our daily media
3310426 i always thought it would be more exiting for batman to work outside the law rather than inside it i guess growing up in the bronx we used to be vigilantes to survive
3310427 nos encantar a tener m s gente desde el primer d a
3310428 esto es inaceptable para nosotros y los patrocinadores as que nuevamente nos prometieron que van a hacer algo al respecto
3310429 desde ayer vimos que no hab a mucha gente dentro del parque ol mpico as que vamos a animar a la gente para que venga
3310430 pens que iba a estar mucho m s cerca despu s del primer asalto
3310431 creo que la puntuaci n fue mala creo que le dieron puntos por cualquier cosa y yo tuve que trabajar para conseguir mis puntos sab a que la nica forma que pod a ganar esta pelea era si no me pegaba
3310432 no estoy diciendo que gan pero cuando est s atr s haces cosas a las que no est s acostumbrado
3310433 la audiencia comprender que se trataba de algo de inter s nacional
3310434 se confirm que se proporcion anticipadamente a los compa as de televisi n por conveniencia y para efectos teatrales como en otros grandes eventos
3310435 el d a de la ceremonia hubo pisadas humanas aut nticas de sur a norte de la ciudad
3310436 sin embargo debido a la escasa visibilidad durante la noche puede que se haya usado material pregrabado

3310438 this thing s going to crest a half a billion soon
3310439 what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that itunes or any competing service couldn t
3310440 the thing we ve all been looking for is what can we do that is a little more interesting than just looking at a piece of video
3310441 right now im like a contestant on american idol my family and friends have told me how great i am but once i get out there and really try to perform my inexperience is going to show but yes eventually id like to do that
3310442 but dont start a business or write a novel just to feel like you are an ok person you are already ok you are already enough
3310443 oh i would never be pta president i simply wont take that much time away from my children
3310444 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3310445 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3310446 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3310447 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3310448 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3310449 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3310450 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3310451 i am getting a little bit sick and tired of what were seeing a battle of words from left and right
3310452 apparently it was an improvised explosive device that hit the bus
3310453 isaac didnt read music but you couldnt believe a guy could sit at a piano and come up with the sounds he did
3310454 when people talk about the memphis sound that was isaac
3310455 they said shaft was a relentless character and it had to denote some kind of action or drama
3310456 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3310457 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3310458 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3310459 out of the continuing upward spiral of health care costs
3310460 i think the company and unions agree that this simply cannot be a matter of companies solving all the problems
3310461 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3310462 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3310463 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3310464 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3310465 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3310466 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3310467 we have a speculative bubble in prices thats giving way to what now i think are more moderate levels
3310468 i think we can look forward to a resumption of an improvement in equity prices based on still good earnings coming out of many companies
3310469 they told me we succeeded we are the world champions i told them we reached our target
3310470 other teams were good but we were better we performed perfect today everyone was excellent
3310471 it bothers me a lot especially if people from home kind of put down our team saying count the u
3310472 i wish more people in the u s believed in us like we believed in us now i hope more people realize the u s is a force to be reckoned with
3310473 since athens the chinese team has run into a lot of failures which tested the team
3310474 i know them and they do work very hard and put a lot of hard work in their training we worked as team we enjoyed it and thats more important than anything
3310475 we always believed in ourselves and we kept at it tenacious
3310476 and our guys knocked it out of the park it was just amazing
3310477 todays game was overall not a comfortable game from a personal standpoint
3310478 i knew that barring something like that happening for me i was probably going to go home and have a pretty rough night
3310479 now i can go home and look forward to tomorrow its a nice feeling
3310480 he comes into situations like this and hes just not making pitches
3310481 at first i thought it was going to stay fair for sure then i saw it had kind of had a little lean to it
3310482 i wasnt positive whether it would stay fair im glad it did
3310483 all the time i wait for this kind of moment
3310484 this guy had a no hitter going into the sixth inning without his best stuff
3310485 he ran his pitch count with those five walks but were so happy for this kid weve got a pitcher here hes got four pitches and he can throw them for strikes
3310486 a pakistan cricket board pcb spokesman told the media in karachi
3310487 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3310488 i just met with my national security team to discuss the situation in georgia i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tiblisi
3310489 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3310490 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3310491 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3310492 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3310493 in 2004 i won the gold medal for myself today i won it for all my supporters and fans
3310494 we didnt want to let them stick around we wanted to let the crowd know that we were ready to play you dont want to play around with teams if you have a chance to make a statement and put them away early you do that
3310495 while china still represents a fertile ground for growing subscriber numbers there are already discernable patterns in the types of services that will succeed in this market this can be an opportunity for forward thinking operators to differentiate themselves early and separate from the pack
3310496 creating new services and bringing them to market is often costly time consuming and extremely risky services that look irresistible on paper can easily turn out to be expensive mistakes by taking existing services that have been highly successful like instant messaging has been for the internet and porting them onto another access network operators are able to extend their total average revenue per application tarpa with significantly lower risk
3310497 this study is one step towards a greater insight into the relationship between oily substances and water at the molecular level an area of fundamental science which is relatively little understood but which has enormous potential for industry medicine and nanotechnology
3310498 it was very interesting to see that our results suggest there is no tiny gap between oil and water when they meet despite having a reputation for not liking each other it seems the opposite is true they may not be able to mix but they come into full contact with each other at a strong interface perhaps they like each other more than we previously thought
3310499 there is so much information out there that its hard for people both the public and professionals to know what can be relied upon a scheme with a recognisable quality mark will assure them that information is from a dependable source
3310500 over 120 applications were received by dh and the royal college of psychiatrists is one of just 40 organisations to have successfully made it through the application process the work of these test sites will be invaluable in providing knowledge and insight for organisations who are considering joining the scheme in the future
3310501 one body rather than three means a stronger voice fighting for consumers it means a joined up and co ordinated approach to tackling problems rather than the old fragmented system
3310502 these difficult economic times make consumer focus even more important im sure it will campaign hard for better deals for consumers and do all it can to help people through this period of uncertainty
3310503 at a time of rising food fuel and mortgage costs there could not be a better time to see a new consumer champion come forward and campaign for people
3310504 from this autumn we will build on the good work of our predecessors energywatch postwatch the national consumer council scottish consumer council and welsh consumer council to win a better deal for consumers
3310505 the new name has been chosen by consumers and staff to reflect our goal of making a practical difference to people
3310506 the detection of life on another planet would represent the most dramatic discovery in the history of science exomars and its organic detection instruments will tell us whether we are alone in the universe
3310507 planetary magnetic fields like earths protect the atmosphere from solar wind bombardment helping to retain water vapour and protecting all living creatures from hazardous radiation without it life would not exist on earth understanding how magnetic fields exist on other planets helps us to understand how life can form and survive
3310508 as well as investigating the potential for life exomars will be the first lander to look deep within the planet the mission im currently working on phoenix has literally just scraped the surface of mars we hope with the imperial microseismometer on exomars will be able to look much deeper right down to the core of the planet
3310509 this new wind farm demonstrates our commitment to dramatically increase the amount of energy we generate from renewable sources helping to cut the uks carbon emissions and secure our energy supplies
3310510 sheringham shoal will be the uks fourth largest offshore wind farm approved to date and will help provide a significant contribution towards our renewable energy targets
3310511 companies want to build here because we have made the uk one of the most attractive places to invest in wind power by the end of 2009 a further 626mw of offshore wind power will be plugged in to the grid making us world leaders
3310512 through the planning bill we are also looking to speed up the planning process for developers and to improve consultations to make sure wind farms are built in the right places
3310513 if were going to try and compete even at premier league level let alone europe we need a decent squad so we need to keep adding quality if we can
3310514 this has come as a surprise and i am disappointed
3310515 carlos cuellar has been a great player for the football club and inevitably there has been speculation about him playing in the premiership
3310516 we are a socialist country there is no need for charities government supplies everything your american charities might provide
3310517 i dont think government is big enough or intrusive enough in our lives i think taxes should be higher spending should be greater and government should regulate every aspect of our daily business and lives
3310518 i believe in the power of the individual and free enterprise at least moreso than government allows today to help people reach their human potential therefore i advocate lower taxes lower spending and less government regulation

3310542 china has almost spared no expense to welcome visitors to the games the message sent at the opening ceremony was loud and strong drawing attention to the countrys rich history and culture through the most innovative creative program that most of us have ever seen and that message went far and wide even reaching record levels of television audiences in the usa2 here in china their compatriots were also the biggest spenders on visa cards that same day
3310543 a safe and efficient payment system is important to the host country of the olympic games as visitors from all over the world expect to be able to make electronic payment as they do at home to this end visa is committed to help china develop a world class financial infrastructure and is working closely with the government tourism bodies and client financial institutions to build a robust electronic payment system in china

3310552 the new environmentalists how to make the green movement less white
3310553 inkworks is a political collective as well as worker run printshop with the goal of being a sustainable project for its workers and the environment as the concept of green reaches critical mass and goes mainstream we want to work with our allies in opening up the debate to include issues such as economic democracy worker solidarity and the struggles of women and people of color it is important to be critical of the apalling green washing that is happening around us but we especially want to place emphasis on the real examples of people struggling for truly sustainable and just ways to live
3310554 every year the california society of printmakers selects a different guest editor who puts together an issue on a particular theme
3310555 people are still getting married and having stag weekends and we are finding they are less likely to go abroad and more likely to come here
3310556 people might be spending less generally but were not seeing any downturn they pull in the purse strings in other areas whether its food or home spending but after a tough week they are still wanting to enjoy themselves
3310557 i know from speaking to a lot of hoteliers that they are getting a lot more short breaks because people are just not going away
3310558 with the strength of the euro and more people tending to spend more time in britain rather than abroad it does seem that there are more domestic visitors to edinburgh
3310559 there is nothing wrong with that type of business stag and hen parties as long as it is controlled there has been problems with people targeting stag and hen parties with cheaper drink offers in edinburgh in the past and that can lead to problems
3310560 but that kind of discounting is not happening any more so it can only be a good thing
3310561 this is extremely encouraging to see edinburgh visitor attractions reaping the benefits of an increased domestic market and this will potentially have knock on effects for other tourism businesses in the area
3310562 due to the economic climate there may well be a greater number of people exploring their own country and partaking in activities as a cheaper alternative to flying abroad
3310563 world politics would be very different today were it not for winston churchill

3310580 we initially tried to eliminate these errors manually using spreadsheets
3310581 it was soon apparent that this was unworkable especially when we published the data on our website for feedback from residents we reviewed a number of gazetteer management solutions and ggp ngz was simply the best product for our needs
3310582 ggp ngz is easy to use for the ongoing maintenance of the gazetteer and possibly of greater importance easy to integrate with other systems and services

3310966 the community toilet scheme is a common sense and cost effective solution to the lack of public toilets in london it is also an ingenious way around the high costs normally associated with running them
3310967 older people and families with young children in particular find the lack of publics loos inconvenient and an incredible burden when out and about
3310968 in the longer term however i want the government to face up to its responsibilities and provide londoners with the greater public amenities they deserve by changing current legislation and providing local authorities with more funding for essential services
3310969 the community toilet scheme is an excellent example of how boroughs can take simple steps to make life that little bit more convenient for their residents several boroughs are already running the scheme in their local area and im sure many more will now answer the mayors call and set them up for their communities
3310970 we are delighted the mayor of london has singled out our scheme for praise and recommended other councils to consider adopting a similar initiative
3310971 the community toilet scheme is an innovative idea where the council supports local pubs cafes and shops with an annual sum in exchange for which they welcome visitors to use their toilets freely and without having to make a purchase we now have 75 premises signed up all over the borough since the scheme was introduced we now have more toilets kept clean and safe and open for longer hours than ever before
3310972 the games will be the catalyst for improved transport links which are needed to support revitalised communities and future generations in london long after 2012
3310973 ranging from a new dlr station in stratford to improved transport coordination across the uk there is no doubt that the games will deliver unprecedented transport improvements for london long after 2012
3310974 we are getting on with delivering better public transport cycling and walking facilities well before 2012

3310994 i dont think anyone in the 1950s and 1960s thought liturgy was anything other than a legal prescription the idea that liturgy has a profound effect on both individuals and congregations wasnt even considered
3310995 people were shaped in their spirituality by the liturgy they didnt need to be told that they were
3310996 it is the mass i have not celebrated out of obedience since 1970
3310997 to develop a better understanding of the spiritual impact of the liturgy and to promote active participation on the part of all men and women in the worship of the church
3310998 the idea that the parish is the body that can most effectively carry the gospel to the world
3310999 through lay participation in the liturgy congregations could be built up into active communities of service and love
3311000 the local church must be interested in the daily lives of men and women in their work in their leisure activities and in their social concerns
3311001 the unemployed and marginalized were the very people whom the church if true to the mission of jesus christ should be specially searching for and serving
3311002 the lonely and poor needed was to feel wanted and one thing the church should be able to give was a sense of belonging to a human community
3311003 that the corporate worship of the laity must be renewed everywhere
3311004 taught that worship is something that lay persons must do together in order to grow into the unity of the body of christ

3311306 under an agreement drawn up through the sadi program broens industries has committed to upskilling a total of 80 staff over the next three years
3311307 broens industries is a sydney based small to medium sized enterprise sme delivering precision engineering toolmaking automation solutions and special purpose machinery across a broad range of industries including automotive marine mining pharmaceutical and now the aerospace and defence sectors
3311308 this new agreement represents a joint commitment on the part of defence and broens industries to spend over 2 million on defence specific professional and technical training activities
3311309 to date broens has been geared to provide integrated manufacturing systems to the automotive industry but with the additional sadi support broens industries will be better equipped to support australias defence and aerospace sectors
3311310 the sadi initiative shares the responsibility for skills growth and development between industry and government with a view to addressing the unique character of many defence relevant skills
3311311 these agreements are extremely important in addressing the rising demand associated with the ongoing modernisation and expansion of the australian defence forces capability

3311316 there will never be another j k rowling thats a lot of pressure on me isnt it
3311317 im just happy being stephenie meyer thats cool enough for me
3311318 i think that after 30 years of being the most normal person in the whole world its really hard to become ungrounded
3311319 when im not out on tour or doing photo shoots i tend to just forget about it all
3311320 the nice thing is that 95 of the time im just mom and were just doing the normal thing and im here and its good
3311321 because you didnt hear people saying jon stewart jewish writer when his book came out i guess being a mormon is just odd enough that people think its still a real story obviously to me it seems super normal its just my religion
3311322 i was for an age limit of 15 or 16 and a warning
3311323 i think the content is just a little harder to handle a little bit more grown up for really young kids i have 9 year old readers and i think its too old for them some of its violence and some of its just mature themes
3311324 i guess theres a conditioning from fairy tales that the wedding is the end of the story but i think most of us know its another kind of beginning
3311325 there are actual things in the story that i was worried about being spoilers but the wedding isnt one of them thats the basic beginning of the story and then thats when all the trouble starts
3311326 the e mail messages i get say if bella doesnt end up with edward forever im going to burn this book and the next one i get will say if bella doesnt end up with jacob forever ill burn this book

3311335 parece ins lito que las aves salvajes hayan acarreado la cepa a africa ya que la ltima migraci n de stas desde europa y asia central a africa ocurri en septiembre de 2007 y la migraci n del sur al continente no ha comenzado todav a este a o
3311336 ciertamente pudo haber otros canales para la introducci n del virus comercio internacional por ejemplo o traslado ilegal y no denunciado de aves de corral esto aumenta el riesgo de que la gripe aviaria se extienda a otros pa ses del oeste de africa

3311405 i spend 1 000 riyals every a day on qat and i earn about 4 000
3311406 im sad that its there but i enjoy the culture
3311407 we have chews where we listen to music or talk politics but i dont want my staff to chew i dont want them to waste their money especially if they dont have very much
3311408 the decision not to use qat is not equivalent to the decision to decline drinks at a dinner party
3311409 it is much more important because it excludes the person from social contacts that are necessary for his business or private life
3311410 its got to the stage where foreign donors say the government needs to choose between qat and food
3311411 qat is a drug even if every yemeni will fight you if you say that it has all the symptoms its a cash crop that is part of a vicious cycle of internal bleeding people in this country are simply chewing their way to oblivion
3311412 i never expected that i would be doing this for as long as ive been doing it
3311413 so looking back and seeing that its been over 40 years since the first hits makes you think is there a time that you stop
3311414 but i dont think im ever going to stop its the only challenge i have left in my life
3311415 because i do the same thing i run a two hour marathon every time onstage so i have my electrolytes kept at a certain level and i do my carb loading after the shows for the next night
3311416 somehow its dawning on me that im a more mature individual and im not a kid writing cherry cherry anymore
3311417 that after that happens where do you go you have gravity and it goes down
3311418 i have to be honest im not crazy about it
3311419 most of these people havent heard hell yeah or man of god but i see them and theyre listening and thats really all i want
3311420 someone much greater than me gave me that job he said you you with that stupid look on your face go out and sing until i tell you to stop i havent heard the word yet so im just going to keep doing it
3311421 hematologic iron analyte values as an indicator of hepatic hemosiderosis in callitrichidae
3311422 with this test we can easily and safely monitor the iron levels in marmosets and tamarins for early identification of individuals that may be predisposed to develop hemosiderosis an overload of iron in the body despite the low iron diet that has been fine tuned to the unique requirements of these species
3311423 commonly discoveries in animals lead to helping human health but this is an instance in which methodologies developed to detect conditions in humans can help veterinarians provide the same level of care to animals that share similar conditions especially our closely related non human primates
3311424 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
3311425 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
3311426 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
3311427 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
3311428 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
3311429 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
3311430 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
3311431 i have frozen them for 12 hours at a time and about 50 percent of them survive
3311432 la primera regata fue excelente tome el lado correcto de la cancha y defend el tercer lugar y termin bastante holgado en general en las dos regatas ten a muy buena velocidad con buenas partidas limpias y claras con opciones de tomar las posiciones que yo quer a
3311433 fue un d a muy dif cil las condiciones fueron las esperadas con viento suave la primera regata fue m s suave que la segunda donde hubo un cambio de corriente y tuve un error en la primera salida que me hizo salir de los 10 primeros lugares y terminar 34 fue un error fatal
3311434 imagine the convenience of being able to store transport and backup all of your digital content without having to span disks or carry multiple storage solutions
3311435 my goggles filled up with water as soon as i dived in i couldnt see anything even to spot my turns i was going to stop and try and fix them but that would have made things worse
3311436 i had to put my goggles on the outside rather on the inside as i normally would because it was a different hat and thats what probably did it
3311437 poolside olympic officials at the swimming venue refused to let andrew wear his competition cap because of the size and number of the commercial logos on the item not the shamrock symbol
3311438 swim ireland the national federation who are responsible for swimming performance gear were instructed on many occasions by the oci that the swimming gear should be unbranded and this requirement was accepted and agreed
3311439 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3311440 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3311441 its misleading in the first place its not a value for money review its a review to set out how they can save 250 000 which is what they said they were going to do in february
3311442 its making cuts and dressing it up as improvements and i dont see how the service is going to be improved at all
3311443 i have to admit i was concerned about how he looked up on the platform he has a habit of showing tension by drawing his hands down across his face but yesterday it was excessive
3311444 we need to give tom a little space we have to let him breathe
3311445 what can you do but keep going i have no answer to it and neither has anyone else
3311446 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3311447 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3311448 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3311449 said himself he thinks that it isnt necessarily the right moment given the olympic games for a meeting with the president
3311450 he was believed to be among the top leadership of al qaida
3311451 there are many foreign elements there more than local militants
3311452 its less than six degrees of separation from one unsolved mystery to another or from the
3311453 in a bizarre case of six degrees of scandal separation hunter was married in the 1990s to kip hunter son of the colorado district attorney who famously led the failed jonbenet ramsey murder investigation they divorced in 1999
3311454 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3311455 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3311456 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3311457 the advance casts doubts on russias claim that this five day war is just a peacekeeping operation
3311458 this war is all about russia and the message russias sending to the world this is putins announcement that russia is back as a great power
3311459 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of nowhere
3311460 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3311461 i am getting a little bit sick and tired of what were seeing a battle of words from left and right
3311462 we didnt know they went to the surface to feed
3311463 we cant say whether or not the shark took a swimming young bear or ate a carcass
3311464 we dont know how active these sharks are as predators
3311465 i wont be going swimming there again they are incredibly cryptic dark sharks who move slowly and get in close
3311466 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3311467 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3311468 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3311469 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3311470 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3311471 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff
3311472 the powerful human impulse to help an identifiable person whose life is in danger no matter how much it costs
3311473 when there are limited resources applying the rule of rescue may mean other people will not have the care or treatment they need
3311474 we shouldnt have a formal rule of rescue because our general guidance took into account provision for exceptional cases that can allow the institute to recommend treatment above our normal cost threshold
3311475 we would be opposed to ignoring a rule of rescue when it introduces a degree of flexibility around extreme cases so what if you waste a few pounds if you are doing your best for humanity
3311476 we plough billions into cancer research but the benefits of that research some remarkable drug treatments are not available to all who need them patients are disregarded and given up on because they cannot get the drugs they need
3311477 friends and neighbors came to witness them getting off the trailers they ran off into the meadow and havent stopped eating since

3311483 anyone interested can send me an e mail telling me what they are looking for
3311484 despite the notice were still working diligently to reorganize and restructure to get out of our financial predicament
3311485 there are a few different groups of investors were talking to to get to the bank before sept 12
3311486 we did have the fund raiser that helped buy us some time
3311487 we have music in august and some planned in september but if things go well well have an announcement that things will go on the scope of what needs to happen is beyond a few better nights of business its about restructuring
3311488 now people are thinking about the cost of taking an hour drive and paying 25 for a ticket bands are having a hard time traveling and real estate values went down although we had to bring in the capital for improvements
3311489 were looking at things like changes in the business where we might be in the minority role half of the building isnt even being utilized and we can bring in improvements maybe create a function room or a place for artist space rehearsal rooms expand the restaurant hopefully therell be some people with financial backing to make the building fully utilized
3311490 earmark has become a pejorative word but what it means is that i go to my colleagues in congress and convince them that unh has the talent and ability to monitor airborne pollutants and needs this money
3311491 it gives us the essence of getting into what we need to know to make intelligent decisions about the environment
3311492 this facility sets us up as an international leader in air quality monitoring
3311493 it gives us the ability to understand the impact of air quality on this region
3311494 femas damage assessment found that communities suffered major and costly damage
3311495 im pleased that president bush has moved to issue this disaster declaration to provide financial assistance to communities
3311496 i am disappointed the federal government will not be assisting the many new hampshire families impacted by this severe weather and we will be asking that the decision not to include individual assistance be reviewed
3311497 the state of new hampshire will continue to work closely with local communities and volunteer organizations to help ensure our citizens who were impacted by the storm get the assistance they need
3311498 recent storms have caused significant damage in many communities across new hampshire which is why we are asking fema to begin assessments to determine eligibility for federal assistance
3311499 this is a typical july scenario where you see a sharp drop from june
3311500 last year we saw a 43 percent decline between june and july
3311501 i can see that happening again with the solid number of pending transactions we have right now
3311502 es ist nicht einzusehen warum die familienbeihilfe nur f r bestimmte gruppen angepasst werden soll
3311503 in my experience there is a very good reason why a good looking young woman of around 20 is willing to go out with a man over 15 years her senior shes nuts
3311504 the reason some younger women were willing to go out with my flabby ageing self was that no one of their own age would put up with them for more than 10 minutes what older men and younger women have in common is they are both suffering from different insecurities she is looking for someone to make her feel safe and he is looking for someone who doesnt answer back and is a trophy
3311505 younger women are willing to go out with high status males if you look at the kind of women salman rushdie attracts they tend to be intelligent arty types for her its a kudos thing the man just wants a good looking girl because he imagines that when his friends see him theyll all think gosh i wish i was him when in fact everybody is thinking you sad git are you so emotionally immature that you cannot sustain a relationship with a woman of your own age you just want someone who wont answer back
3311506 she seemed normal to begin with but i soon realised she was a bit strange when she insisted on going on long walks in the cold wearing nothing but a thin blouse her arms turned blue
3311507 the norm in this society is for people to marry and have children when theyre of similar age and are relatively young
3311508 the couple will have kids and spend their old age together thats roughly the model that most people follow when people deviate dramatically from this it could indicate they have strange ideas about sexuality
3311509 if a man is significantly older theyre making love to someone who could potentially be their daughter equally when i hear interviews with younger women who marry much older blokes they often sound like they dont particularly want a husband or a lover but a father figure these situations could cause real problems in a relationship
3311510 i think a relationship with that a big gap can have an added spark
3311511 it just depends on the person a lot of people are born old and others are born young inside im still 17 and sometimes in shops ill try on things that are far too young for me and look in the mirror and think whos that if youve still got that spark age shouldnt come into it
3311512 in my book conrad reaches 70 and starts to feel frail and guilty that his wife will soon have to start to look after him he begins to think she would be better off without him
3311513 youve got to be feeling very confident about yourself before you embark if youre like rupert murdoch who has a wife who is younger than him then im sure youd easily be able to keep up but that might not always be the case
3311514 young men stay adolescent for an awful long time you might want to live with a grown up who doesnt still expect his mum to pick up his pizza boxes from under the bed
3311515 its no coincidence that this type of relationship often happens to creative charismatic older men like musicians teachers writers and actors theyll have the imagination to keep up with their younger partner i cant see an accountant whos into golf and cardigans pulling a woman 30 years younger unless she is prematurely into golf and cardigans herself
3311516 the pair will have nothing in common but an inability to form meaningful relationships with partners of their own age
3311517 we have been there or thereabouts but we have suffered a number of disappointments on this front mores the pity however we are always optimistic
3311518 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy recognising the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil

3311520 i have got to get into the top three in the semi final this is the big one now
3311521 i still havent produced my full potential and i would be very disappointed if i dont make the semi finals
3311522 in confrontations on monday troops killed 26 ltte terrorists and 29 were wounded
3311523 i took a view that china was going to be a world power
3311524 my kids started learning mandarin when they were four years old
3311525 when i went to taiwan 20 years ago and opened offices there i was impressed with the entrepreneurial spirit of the chinese people when they werent shackled
3311526 then in 2001 i travelled again over their major mainland industrial areas and noted that the taiwanese free spirit of business was spreading all through china
3311527 i dont see a revolution coming in china any more than in the united states
3311528 chinese people want change but not the radical change that western commentators imagine
3311529 the economic elite has either come out of the party elite or its been absorbed into it
3311530 otherwise not only will our generation lose face but also our ancestors
3311531 in the 1960s people werent necessarily convinced they were just terrorised into submission
3311532 now they stress management rather than control because they understand that persuasion is more effective than force
3311533 it does help explain the resilience of communist party rule despite the fissures in society and the corruption of much of officialdom
3311534 in the chinese cultural context a regimes legitimacy is conferred largely by its ability to mobilise this bureaucratic tradition
3311535 that is one of those real tipping points because that is something which they themselves whatever the rest of us think see as a fundamental core national interest
3311536 which doesnt mean necessarily that they will go to using that approach to their overall global engagements theyre going to need the rest of us for such a long time theres still so much that they cant do
3311537 theres no doubt that china saw the games as a sign of their international acceptance and its a good thing that they want it
3311538 in short to use an english expression they should take it easy
3311539 given that the nc is adamant to allowing us to have the defence ministry in a government led by us we talked with the cpn uml about ways to find solutions to this state of deadlock and we even urged the cpn uml to lead the government if they wish to
3311540 both the cpn m and nc have urged us to lead the next government but we are stressing forming a national consensus government incorporating at least four major parties
3311541 at this time there are no plans for tori to appear in the 90210 spin off

3311543 they park wherever they want to they just park right in my driveway and dont think a thing of it
3311544 they want it like it was 20 30 years ago but its not that way anymore growth creates problems its as simple as that
3311545 lets just turn the whole place into a parking lot thats what youre going to do
3311546 nothing has sucked the air from the lungs as much as sevens decision to drop an advertisement by getup in a democracy where freedom of speech is a given sevens craven self censoring efforts represent a gold medal act of moral cowardice

3311549 dean is a great capture for the club he has played regularly at the top level for eight seasons and im sure that his style of play will be a big plus for us and he will be a big favourite with the fans
3311550 dean is a good character and a really creative strong running back rower with plenty of pace a good step and he is a proven line breaker
3311551 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy recognising the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil
3311552 its her nanny she is a young moroccan woman who is qualified to look after children and works in a care centre
3311553 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go
3311554 if it was a big city marathon or even a world championships id say do not push it make sure i was well prepared but i do not want to sit there watching it wondering what could have happened
3311555 id rather go in like this than the shape i was in back in 2004 when i was not well
3311556 inflation is impacting on the economy differently in different sectors
3311557 other sectors like oil and energy are printing inflation by hiking prices
3311558 even when their costs are falling they are slow to pass these lower prices to consumers
3311559 motorists can see that there is 7 to 8 pence difference per litre in the price of diesel between petrol stations across the country this is just a rip off
3311560 action must be taken against this profiteering action must also be taken to stop damaging speculation in the oil market
3311561 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3311562 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3311563 he is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club
3311564 i gave him an update on the club and we talked about new player acquisitions
3311565 we also talked over dinner about why he had bought the club and his intentions
3311566 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years
3311567 ad una crescita percentuale di affidamento condiviso dei figli non corrispondono misure troppo diverse da quelle erogate con il vecchio ordinamento in troppi tribunali laffidamento condiviso solo unetichetta da incollare al precedente orientamento cambia solo la dicitura i figli non pi affidati ma collocati presso un solo genitore che per leffetto ottiene lassegnazione della casa coniugale ed il versamento di un contributo al mantenimento esattamente il contrario di ci che il legislatore intendeva riformare in buona sostanza le rilevazioni statistiche riflettono una facciata luminosa dietro la quale si nasconde un panorama reale ancora grigio associazioni di genitori che hanno promosso e sostenuto la riforma ma anche magistrati avvocati psicologi pedagogisti e decine di parlamentari convergono sulla necessit di aggiornare la normativa fino ad oggi impoverita da una disapplicazione avvilente
3311568 da una concreta applicazione del condiviso in italia il vero boom a cui stiamo assistendo quello relativo alle centinaia di provvedimenti difformi dal dettato della legge 54 che il nostro osservatorio sta ricevendo da tutto il paese a conferma che i dati sciorinati in questi giorni dallistat nascondo una realt del tutto diversa le dimensioni del problema oggi appaiono allarmanti
3311569 a ben guardare le attuali modalit applicative della legge il mandato del parlamento stato tradito proprio da chi doveva garantirne la corretta applicazione laffidamento condiviso stato svuotato dal significato che il legislatore gli aveva attribuito e lestremo arbitrio con cui la magistratura continua ad applicare la giurisprudenza precedente sotto gli occhi di tutti
3311570 un genitore deve minacciare di darsi fuoco di fronte ad un tribunale per ottenere ascolto da parte di quelle istituzioni che negano ostinatamente il suo diritto alla genitorialit evidente che questo stato di cose non funziona magistratura e servizi sociali spesso intervengono in modo sproporzionato commettendo errori sulla pelle dei bambini
3311571 ci che manca quel cambiamento culturale che il legislatore auspicava dovesse avvenire nei tribunali ditalia con la novella legge 54 del 2006 in questi due anni di oblio invece migliaia di bambini hanno continuato a subire la violenza dell allontanamento dal genitore escluso mentre listat pretende di dare ai cittadini lillusione che tutto sia stato risolto doloroso ammettere che dalla entrata in vigore della legge 54 alla sua concreta applicazione da parte della magistratura intercorra un lasso di tempo che miete ancora vittime
3311572 at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3311573 youre looking at a cinematic device employed by zhang yimou here
3311574 this is actually almost animation a footstep a second 29 in all to signify the 29 olympiads
3311575 we said earlier that aspects of this opening ceremony are almost like cinema in real time well this is quite literally cinematic
3311576 stunned viewers thought they were watching the string of fireworks filmed from above by a helicopter
3311577 but in reality they were watching a 3 d graphics sequence that took almost a year to produce
3311578 inserted into the coverage electronically at exactly the right moment
3311579 meticulous efforts were made to ensure the sequence was as unnoticeable as possible
3311580 they sought advice from the beijing meteorological office as to how to recreate the hazy effects of beijings smog at night and inserted a slight camera shake effect to simulate the idea that it was filmed from a helicopter
3311581 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3311582 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3311583 we can confirm that steven pienaar has broken the big toe in his right foot

3311593 this will be its first public appearance i saw copies for the first time today with any luck it will be available within a couple days
3311594 really i honestly think hes the one that saved me
3311595 they say i gave him a second chance at life but he gave me a second chance i was going through one of those teenager phases not handling things the way i should and not sure what i wanted out of life doing this helped me realize that life is too short
3311596 she kept the victim calm kept him focused on living kept him awake kept him from going into shock she wouldnt let him see that his arm was missing
3311597 i told his friends we needed to apply a tourniquet
3311598 one of them gave me his belt and i held it in place i couldnt tie it or clasp it i kept telling him to talk to me dont go to sleep
3311599 did a remarkable job and kept her emotions in check she was talking to him calmly telling him he was going to be ok i go to a lot of accident scenes and ive seen a lot of adults panic over injuries of people hurt a lot less than he was in my personal opinion shes a hero in her own right
3311600 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
3311601 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
3311602 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
3311603 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
3311604 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
3311605 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
3311606 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
3311607 the exhaustive search for interpreters did not last for almost a year
3311608 i wouldve kept the program going if i had just had the people
3311609 im glad to come here and not screw it up
3311610 i think those generally lingering around 30 do pretty well but give me five years
3311611 and guys like kenny kimber and anthony bernard they keep getting younger and we keep getting older so eventually its got to come to an end but its fun while it lasts
3311612 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3311613 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3311614 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3311615 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3311616 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3311617 hopefully i get rid of it soon and get back to where i should be starting obviously this is not what i was looking to happen at all
3311618 the idea behind using a porous pavement is that it allows the saturation of water back to the earth to happen where the water falls
3311619 having more area constructed of a permeable surface allows stormwater and rain to naturally percolate into the earth instead of being forced into detention areas or creating significant runoff conditions
3311620 core physicians is committed to conducting business in a conscious and eco friendly manner
3311621 the responsibility of those who develop properties is changing as we become more sensitive to the benefits of making things sympathetic to the environment
3311622 as a major employer and member of the greater exeter community core physicians takes this commitment seriously and hopes others will follow their example
3311623 traditional methods of treating stormwater runoff are not able to remove the chloride from road salt which not only affects the surrounding plant material but also accelerates the deterioration of most building materials concrete and metals
3311624 the natural snow melting properties of this porous pavement will allow us to use up to 75 percent less salt to safely maintain this parking lot in the winter months
3311625 through the combination of the stone and the sand much of what is picked up in the water is filtered out before the water is absorbed by the ground
3311626 it is gratifying to see that our research results are fast becoming the basis for the standards of practice in stormwater management
3311627 i cannot think of a more holistic setting to integrate the care for people and the environment than a medical facility
3311628 to have one of our local businesses actually implement one of these innovative approaches is just awesome
3311629 we can now point to this project as an example when we try to sell the notion of using porous pavement to different businesses and developers that come before the planning board
3311630 i want the legislature to do this to protect us in case there is a further deficit this year
3311631 if it gets much worse we will have to consider taxes but only as a last resort
3311632 i am confident the legislature will come back next week in special session and address the fiscal crisis
3311633 the governor is right that they need to act now that the deficit is only going to get worse
3311634 but there will be big resistance in the legislature particularly in the assembly
3311635 i was running a fever of 104 degrees and it was hard to breathe i was weak and i couldnt sweat it off
3311636 its hard because a lot of people dont understand what im going through these days nobody has heard of sarcoidosis nobody knows anything about it
3311637 i was like oh my goodness could that happen to me
3311638 the medications you take suppress your immune system and then you get staph infections fungal infections and bacterial infections
3311639 having this disease with the funny name that no one knows about you feel very isolated
3311640 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
3311641 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing
3311642 we are extremely grateful for the outpouring of assistance and generosity that we have received and hope to convey our appreciation to everyone who has supported us and kept us in their thoughts and prayers
3311643 there are similarities between shooting in the wild and at competitions
3311644 dove hunting definitely helps here because the target presentations are similar
3311645 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3311646 we played really flat when we came out at the beginning of the game and then picked up the intensity
3311647 and then from there on we started rebounding being aggressive and making more shots
3311648 we werent playing as hard and they were working us early no doubt about that
3311649 i called a timeout and told them that and they immediately started playing better and that was the difference they brought their intensity level up and they kept it up for the rest of the game
3311650 we like this one very much and we hope it goes through
3311651 while oil prices are coming down thats not enough to push up the market
3311652 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3311653 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3311654 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3311655 if the world were to draw any lessons from what i did there would never be any wars
3311656 i do believe this is important that we dont make what is already a crowded and difficult environment for the traveling public and flight attendants worse by allowing cellphone use in flight
3311657 we were going to have it in kittys katherine clark barn
3311658 artists feed each other not just through critique which we do but when you paint with someone you get ideas you are inspired by each others work it is enriching
3311659 different things come up like when do you stop painting when is the painting done or what do you do when you are having a slump or your muse is gone we can discuss these things when we are together
3311660 watercolors werent vibrant enough i wanted the intense color of pastels
3311661 i love the immediacy of pastels you can see what youre doing more quickly with this media it is very gratifying it is also very portable i can carry my box with me when doing en plein aire
3311662 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3311663 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3311664 we have consistently said that the two sides should increase understanding lessen differences and expand agreements through dialogue based on equality and mutual respect
3311665 we are firmly against the use of issues such as human rights and religion to interfere in other countries domestic politics
3311666 this is about my life is controlled by outside forces theyre high in depression and anger
3311667 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3311668 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3311688 id rather go into the race healthy and a little bit under prepared than in the shape i was in 2004 but just not healthy and not well enough to endure the race
3311689 ill be the freshest on the start line for sure and i think ill probably be one of the happiest to be there because there have been those points when i really didnt think i would make it

3311699 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3311700 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3311701 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3311702 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3311703 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3311704 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3311705 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3311706 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3311707 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3311708 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3311709 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3311710 we view this transaction as a first step of our growth strategies in the united states and we will achieve greater management flexibility and aim to further strengthen our presence in the united states
3311711 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3311712 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3311713 he is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club
3311714 i gave him an update on the club and we talked about new player acquisitions
3311715 we also talked over dinner about why he had bought the club and his intentions
3311716 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years
3311717 the law is quite clear clubs pay for any policing inside the ground and on immediately adjacent property under their control on matchday
3311718 any other provision deemed necessary is covered by the state its what people pay their taxes for with the premier league alone contributing more that 700m a year to the treasury let alone the tax take from the 13 million fans who attend premier league games during the course of a season
3311719 this long established principle applies to all individuals and organisations in the uk from private individuals to shopping centres pubs and major events like the notting hill carnival
3311720 our clubs work well with their local police forces to make sure that the call on their resources is as little as possible
3311721 they have invested heavily in all seater stadia cctv and stewarding as a result the numbers of police required to ensure public safety and therefore the cost has reduced over the past 15 years
3311722 we are always happy to discuss how it might be possible to further reduce costs or indeed how football can help the police tackle youth crime but we fail to see why football fans should pay twice for policing
3311723 the cash we get given to police our various areas across the country thats provided by government thats provided by people through council tax and the provision of that is to provide a policing service to those areas and to those communities
3311724 if we have to take officers away from them to police football we are not able to recover the cost of that that means our normal police budget is being used for that purpose which means we then have to provide a lesser service to the rest of the community
3311725 there would be no schools no hospitals just a 500 mile high statue of princess diana
3311726 het is triest om te zien dat onze voorvaders zon grote rol hebben gespeeld bij het uitsterven van deze diersoorten
3311727 en nog triester als we ons realiseren dat deze trend nog altijd gaande is
3311728 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3311729 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3311730 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3311731 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3311732 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3311733 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3311734 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3311735 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3311736 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
3311737 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3311738 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3311739 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3311740 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3311741 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3311742 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3311743 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3311744 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3311745 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3311746 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3311747 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3311748 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
3311749 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
3311750 i hope the siggraph experience will help me better propel myself into the industry and hopefully help me be fully employed
3311751 i had a scholarship to vfs last year but couldnt make it up to canada this year siggraph is a great step forward for me
3311752 siggraph is honored to host this special advance screening at the festival
3311753 the star wars films have always been stellar examples of visionary visual effects seeing these effects paired with computer animation and the behind the scenes knowledge from dave filoni will be an incredible experience for fans and film professionals alike
3311754 as the field of computer graphics matures we will continue to see graphics practitioners take on novel challenges that were not even considered just a few years ago
3311755 the modeling and animation techniques used in spore will inspire others to think more creatively about user created content in computer games
3311756 i started with the soundtrack by mixing and re pitching various abstract sounds that i recorded
3311757 the idea being to create music from noises then i procedurally animated numerous abstract 3d objects to the track these animations are then used as source imagery to my 3d noise shaders which have parameters that animate to the soundtrack as well the camera travels through the resulting animated evolving volume i went back and forth between the sound and visuals as i would stumble upon cool moments in each and wanted to tie them together so that every sound event had a visual event and vice versa
3311758 one of the really interesting sets of papers are on what i characterize as gradient based illustration techniques
3311759 they offer very powerful techniques for image creation and editing the applications are as compelling as painting i expect these ideas to move from academia to the artist within a couple years
3311760 who would have guessed that face manipulation would be a trend this year
3311761 we look for novelty technical advancements the highest quality results
3311762 and the wow factor some people do things youd never think of like the bizarre self animating image
3311763 one that im excited about is a piece on digital cinematography
3311764 we have pixar and blue sky giving their approaches to cinematography and setting up camera rigs for wall e and horton and some work from ilm on their digital environments in indiana jones its an eye cracker on monday morning at 8 30 but ill be there and friday is character td day
3311765 someone could come in cold not knowing anything about stereo 3d and come out with an appreciation for the history and technical challenges
3311766 a fairly large group of us were having lunch during the jury meeting for the content of siggraph 08 and one person lamented that at the conference we go absorb information sit passively and listen and then leave were not creating anything we in this case refers to the research community so we talked about it
3311767 its totally freeform but i imagine people will exchange information at the meeting arrange to meet and in the meantime think about the problem
3311768 well give them problems that are grand in nature not something you could solve by writing a paper
3311769 this is a process that starts four years in advance and requires macro and micro management skills
3311770 also the roles that the chair has to fill are mind bogglingly vast
3311771 she has to be a visionary a strategist and a hands on implementer as well as a leader a manager a mentor and a friend all while holding down a day job thankfully the amazing conference team of volunteers and contractors makes meeting that impossibly tall order a possibility
3311772 we have an excellent collection of robotics demos and of course takeo kanade is a featured speaker presenting
3311773 its programmed as a true festival with not only screenings but also production sessions festival talks an entire 3d stereo cinematography track production studio evenings and a festival awards session
3311774 los angeles is really an incredibly popular city with attendees
3311775 that would be like saying the people who contribute and attend could grow to have too much passion and enthusiasm for their work
3311776 when i started my research position less than two years ago i was already deep into the conference planning cycle for 2008 and my managers have been extremely supportive
3311777 one of the exciting projects that they asked me to join within my first months was an academy of technology study on the future of research we interviewed researchers and lab directors both internal and external to ibm in industry and academia we asked them what they saw on the horizon for the next 10 years not just in terms of research topics but also in terms of the way people will be working in research environments our findings were very rich and we aim to publish our final report at the end of this year
3311778 we wanted to keep whats worked in the past but also push ourselves by making a more a festival environment for cg
3311779 it was really kinda supposed to be a quick peek
3311780 but as is the nature of a rabbitholes display once you turn the lights on well i warned him this place was going to go crazy
3311781 many of these cutting edge technologies exemplify how our past informs our future and how it affects the upcoming opportunities and challenges of computer graphics and interactive techniques
3311782 the technologies and installations in new tech demos encourage people to engage with the future as well as celebrate our past as we invigorate explore and define our potential
3311783 mitt f rsta skolminne var krig nu m ste jag uppleva ett till

3311787 two years from now you wont see them inside the site
3311788 i dont know what it was like before but i feel very comfortable and secure
3311789 the pds do not believe that even in difficult economic times anything should be done that would reduce the opportunities for students from all income strands from entering third level education
3311790 it is the policy of the party that we would not support the going back to that simple flat fee structure
3311791 that is not to say that we wouldnt be supporting a more innovative and creative approach to funding
3311792 everything has to be examined and clearly it would be inappropriate to rule things in or out at this stage
3311793 wboc is set to broadcast delmarvas first and only local high definition television newscast wbocs hd newscasts will originate from a spectacular 13 million digital broadcast operations complex called the newsplex
3311794 this has been a fairly difficult time i think for all of us flagship really felt like family and losing that is very trying

3311841 certainly there is valid concern being expressed in the low performance of the market price of our stock however our company fundamentals have never been stronger since may of 2008 our principal investors have elected to convert valor debt into significant amounts of equity i believe that such conversions have resulted in obvious pressure and may have created the perception in the market of a level of company weakness that we believe does not exist while performing these conversions maintains our contractual obligations we are in ongoing discussions with our financiers in an effort to achieve much more positive results in our market capitalization we intend to announce positive information regarding valor revenues reserves and growth activities in the coming weeks

3311898 the operation in upper kodori gorge for forcing out the georgian units develops successfully everything is up to the plan our troops have entered upper kodori gorge
3311899 we will take the region under complete control in a few days
3311900 but shelling and air attacks never stopped in the last few days and its difficult to say how many have remained there
3311901 the tidal wave is sweeping the country even his own former allies are now voting against him
3311902 we on our side are more than committed to embracing a deeper and broader defence and security relationship with singapore
3311903 its in good shape now i will not criticise anything thats happened in the past
3311904 i think we can however make it deeper and broader into the future thats in our interests and i think its in singapores interests as well
3311905 we had a fairly extensive fire and a lot of thick black smoke
3311906 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3311907 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3311908 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3311909 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3311910 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3311911 its a second attempt to bomb this pipeline since august 10
3311912 our goal is to free the kodori gorge of georgian troops
3311913 following recent media reports of significant civilian casualties isaf has now concluded a thorough investigation of the claim and has evidence that those killed were insurgents
3311914 still under observation they then moved to an open field where they were attacked and killed by shots from an isaf aircraft
3311915 how can you be so ignorant of and rude to the government and people of your host country
3311916 coming at a time when the cash flow from the rebates has dried up and the growth in labour income is slowing to a crawl the restriction in lending to households underscores the challenges facing the consumer in the second half of the year

3311918 overall the longer the crunch lingers the longer the economic slump could drag on
3311919 it clearly is going to be difficult to get a loan the fed cutting rates doesnt help a lot when you cant get a lender to make a loan
3311920 given the heightened expectations over such a move the longer the government waits before making its plans known one way or the other the more housing market activity could be hit as people wait to see what will happen
3311921 any further slowdown in already very weak housing market activity would be liable to add to the downward pressure on prices

3311984 i would think its a starting point for both of our rookies we knew coming into the preseason that we had a lot of work to do there there are going to be things from my vantage point that brian brohm did some really good things from the game and well build off of that he was in a bad spot there on his first play of the game with the interception the route progression wasnt what it was supposed to be and thats something where you have to have the discipline to move on to the next receiver he will definitely learn from that situation but once again the productivity was there was it clean no it wasnt clean but theres a number of factors going on well get that cleaned up and i think it was a very good first solid first step for the whole quarterback position

3312012 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3312013 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3312014 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3312015 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3312016 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3312017 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean
3312018 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3312019 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3312020 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3312021 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all

3312034 i gave him an update on the club and we talked about new player acquisitions
3312035 we also talked over dinner about why he had bought the club and his intentions
3312036 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years
3312037 employers have long recognised the value of offering life assurance as part of the overall benefits mix to attract and retain the best talent
3312038 corporate life assurance rates are currently very competitive often significantly lower than the rates that can be obtained by an individual
3312039 the fact that a significant number of people would rather get into debt than share their worries with those closest to them is a shocking indictment of the state of the nations finances
3312040 it shows just how much pressure people are under to stay afloat and with house prices still falling energy costs soaring and rising inflation keeping a cut in interest rates off the agenda the number of people in real trouble will only increase
3312041 its extremely concerning to see how many people are neglecting to take out insurance when going away on holiday

3312074 for albert camus in the myth of sisyphus suicide is not a worthwhile solution because if life is veritably absurd then it is even more absurd to counteract it instead we should engage in living and reconcile the fact that we live in a world without purpose

3312114 it is a very logical thing to do and hopefully it will assuage concerns of leading players and make up their minds to come here
3312115 i am quite impressed with the level of security in place
3312116 it is another matter to satisfy and improve the confidence of key players
3312117 we have got a series of visits that follow the pakistan evaluation
3312118 we go to australia and new zealand and speak to the cricket boards as well as the players association and to the players themselves and then visit england and lets see what comes out
3312119 it is a big challenge to convince the players its upon us to convey the message and to raise the confidence
3312120 what we have seen and experienced is that the security arrangements in place should be sufficient to have the event safe and secure
3312121 it is wrong to compare the success of the two films the hindi film industry is one big market whatever money earned from the movies made goes into one kitty the film industry every one benefits out of successful films actors fees also goes up
3312122 in an area like juhu in suburban mumbai there are 28 shows of the film in one multiplex alone due to this 80 to 90 per cent money is recovered by the producer
3312123 it is quite natural that the collections slump at the start of the second week everything depends on how steep is the decline in box office collections if the steep is less the film is sure to bounce back during the weekend

3312129 mendis was the main difference in the series it was not easy to pick runs when mendis and murali are bowling together the pressure they created made it tough for us
3312130 its important to have someone like mendis he creates opportunities adds pressure and picks up wickets
3312131 he has surprised a lot of us its an advantage to have a guy like him to back murali and chaminda vaas thats where we had lacked somebody that strike option apart from those two guys
3312132 for a new batsman to go in straight away and face two spinners is never easy we are not offering excuses as overall we did not play quality cricket
3312133 it is not about a couple of batsmen alone it is important for everyone to contribute the middle and lower order did not contribute and that let us down in the series

3312214 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3312215 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3312216 this research shows that its important to communicate with parents in real world settings
3312217 they control the food environment for their young child this environment is key to not only what children eat today but how they will eat in the future

3312241 es gibt keinen grund die mittelfristigen aussichten in so d steren farben zu malen wie es einige der professionellen auguren nun tun
3312242 man sollte aber mit blick auf eine ged mpfte entwicklung bis in den herbst nicht schon das gespenst einer rezession an die wand malen
3312243 hier regiert zu einem gewissen teil das prinzip hoffnung aber angesichts der zur ckgehenden belastungsfaktoren und des robusten arbeitsmarkts ist es eine gut begr ndete hoffnung
3312244 wir sind jetzt nicht an einem punkt an dem man ber konjunkturprogramme reden muss wichtig ist dass wir in deutschland zu dauerhaft soliden ffentlichen finanzen kommen
3312245 wir m ssen verhindern dass sich die erwartung in den k pfen festsetzt die inflationsrate k nnte mittelfristig so hoch bleiben wie sie jetzt ist und damit auch zur messlatte f r lohnverhandlungen werden
3312246 das k nnte bis weit ins n chste jahr hinein andauern
3312247 einerseits sagt man dass es in der bundesliga keine typen mehr gibt und dass da so viele mauerbl mchen herumrennen und wenn man dann typen hat ist es auch nicht richtig
3312248 wir sind auf jeden fall st rker als im letzten jahr
3312249 die bayern sind topfavorit und dahinter folgt meiner ansicht nach eine gruppe mit schalke 04 werder bremen und auch dem vfl wolfsburg
3312250 dann kommen vereine wie der hamburger sv bayer leverkusen borussia dortmund hannover 96 und wir
3312251 wir haben nat rlich spieler geholt von denen ich glaube dass sie uns verst rken
3312252 dass es so dargestellt wird als wenn ich lauter pflegef lle h tte also das ist an den haaren herbei gezogen das ist langsam eine frechheit meinen spielern gegen ber

3312255 erstens bin ich davon berzeugt dass er die k rperlichen voraussetzungen hat wenn er weiterspielen will und wenn er rechtzeitig erkl ren w rde dass er wirklich aufh ren will dann h tten wir genug zeit zu reagieren aber das hoffe ich nicht
3312256 nach der meisterschaft hatten wir viele verletzungsprobleme und sind danach nie in den rhythmus gekommen weil wir spieler einsetzen mussten die noch nicht richtig fit waren

3312259 it is very disappointing data with widespread signs of higher price pressures
3312260 it will undoubtedly convince some members of the monetary policy committee to vote for higher rates but we doubt they will reach a majority
3312261 during 2010 2013 we are forecasting average uk house price growth of 8 to 9 percent per annum but could easily accelerate above 10 percent at some points during this part of the cycle returning to the highs reached in 2007 early in 2013 says the report medium term uk house prices can grow by 5 to 7 percent a year and we expect most regions to suffer until the end of 2010 but london and southern regions will outperform the uk post 2010
3312262 the importance of housing as a necessary commodity an aspirational desire and an investment asset will remain firm in the medium term
3312263 there are few signs the slowdown as yet bottomed out
3312264 sales of funds via pension plans have become increasingly important to a growing number of asset managers in recent years
3312265 however even this is not enough to take up the slack when retail investors start favouring cash savings accounts instead of funds and institutions decide their money can be put to better use elsewhere as they did in june
3312266 despite best buys growth opportunities we think the sluggish macro environment and increased competition at retail will continue to weigh on results in both the short and long term
3312267 we are increasingly concerned by the competitive environment with discounters foray into providing services for the consumer
3312268 customer service and installation is one of best buys competitive advantages in a highly competitive and commoditized industry while wal mart and target have no where near the service level of best buy which includes home installation from magnolia and geek squad the fact that these companies are starting to offer installation in a difficult environment could result in a slow down in share gains or possibly even share loss for best buy
3312269 the west is supporting one palestinian faction over the other its all about politics not human rights
3312270 we have warned of the west bank government turning into a security regime and there are indications that we are heading in that direction

3312272 it works in the west bank too therefore i cannot act as if nothing has happened

3312375 i dont think shes as strong as the kazakh woman but taiwan is a part of china so if she wins gold that also counts as ours
3312376 i think it is due to the weather conditions the hot humid weather and rain i think from today there will be more spectators in the stadiums the tickets are sold out thats correct
3312377 many scalpers came to me but i couldnt afford the price for that price id rather stay at home and watch tv
3312378 from the tv broadcasts we can see lots of seats are empty
3312379 we cant afford that and people like us who really want to see the games cant get in

3312383 i knew they were going to give him everything he wanted
3312384 ive been watching the scoring here the first four days and i knew it was bad so i was expecting it
3312385 gu also had a winning strategy repeatedly getting inside on murray before the british fighters superior reach could hurt him neither fighter landed many clear blows and american referee james mcnally penalized both fighters two points apiece for holding in the second round
3312386 you expect a slight bias for the home team but you come to the olympic games and expect a level playing field

3312411 it was a tumultuous year and i could have done without all the headlines even encountered a few anxious moments but for the most part i felt pretty safe and welcome
3312412 over the years quite a few people have come to visit us from europe
3312413 of late many of these people are often advised not to travel to pakistan because its considered to be such a dangerous place when they do come here they say no no no it is totally safe we are totally safe that was a very negative picture we got from the people a very negative picture which is not just actually not correct not the reality of course waziristan that is a dangerous place i would never venture to go there the taliban are there
3312414 i could not go out without an armed guard but here in pakistan i go into the villages on my own
3312415 theyre actually lovely people the only problem ive got is too much tea theyre always offering me tea
3312416 these people were prepared to risk their lives for europeans now that
3312417 we would go to their homes and have lunch or dinner with them
3312418 oftentimes wed feel very uncomfortable because they would be serving us food that we knew they couldnt afford to serve us wed go there and sit on a charpoy a wooden framed straw bed and theyd treat us like royalty out of a tin cup
3312419 my horse got away from me i couldnt stop it so i pulled its head back to get it to stop and it ended up turning and i actually ended up in a little yard of one of the mosques i was afraid i was going to be in trouble because you know thats their holy ground so i hurried up and got it out of there but instead of getting in trouble they invited me in for tea
3312420 i found the idea of working in a muslim culture very interesting from the perspective of a single woman i wondered if i could fit in and how
3312421 the reality of living and working here has been very different than the media coverage ive never been threatened i feel very comfortable here im living proof that pakistan is not the place the media has portrayed it to be
3312422 if you treat people like that is what theyre made of than thats exactly what youre going to get in return

3312430 as the federation of caucasian associations we stress that south ossetia and abkhazia are not breakaway regions they are independent republics their invasion by georgia cannot be accepted just as no invasion in the world can decisions of independence by the people of these countries cannot be rendered null and void through wars south ossetia is currently under invasion by georgia babies are heartlessly being killed there and innocent mothers fathers and the elderly are being lynched
3312431 we want turkey and the rest of the world to recognize these two countries independence as they did for kosovo we call on international democracy and human rights organizations to call for an end to the barbarity in south ossetia

3312439 agile development methodologies are seeing tremendous adoption in isvs and it departments of all sizes
3312440 we are committed to delivering a pure agile toolset via saas later this year and are delighted to have valtech as our partner of choice as we roll that toolset out to market
3312441 valtech enables organizations to leapfrog the endemic challenges that early agile and lean adopters have encountered when attempting to catalyze strategic organizational and personal change within the software and product development lifecycle a focus on developer adoption without an equal focus on corporate and business alignment has consistently proved ineffective
3312442 valtechs ondemand learning training and organizational change programs identify only those agile and lean outcomes that organizations can and should adopt and do so in ways that lead to quick wins crucial to winning support for sustaining the outcomes that agile and lean can provide
3312443 together serena and valtech will ensure that business stakeholders product owners and engineering teams can all equally succeed at acquiring the skill and value that agile tools and best practices offer across the entire software and product development team while moving quickly to adoption and showing a compelling business return
3312444 there is a large gap between the multiple skills demanded from the employer required to remain globally competitive and the skills learnt in educational institutions this industry academia mismatch is one of the affects of globalisation that gives opportunities for document abuse which is seriously manipulated amp misused towards the outward migration of indian knowledge capital as well
3312445 with the exponential increase in our global customer footprint we believe that a consistent set of quality expectations is needed to drive efficiency and performance across the telecommunications supply chain we believe this certification would provide sterlite the unique opportunity to cater to specific needs of our existing global amp indian customers and help us further enhance our customer base

3312482 7 reason why you blogspot users should get a dot com domain
3312483 this brave woman has tried to hang onto her bag but the offender has simply overpowered her and taken it leaving her injured on the pavement
3312484 we can only go by what people say and their body language president hu jintao and premier wen jiabao at every meeting with the prime minister have indicated that they will not be a problem
3312485 that happens when they meet and even in telephone conversations pakistan did its damnedest to block us in the international atomic energy agency iaea but china took a very correct position
3312486 we are hopeful if you take what happened in the iaea when the board of governors debated the india specific safeguards agreement some countries took a strong line particularly on the non proliferation front
3312487 that is the central theme of the objections i am not referring to china smaller countries brought up on heavy dose of non proliferation raised doubts indias impeccable record on non proliferation has been made clear
3312488 wherever we have talked individually they have understood india is unique in many ways we are hopeful of getting nsg clearance
3312489 we have no intention of breaking the moratorium unless circumstances compel us if circumstances compel whether 123 agreement existed or not we would do it because it is in our supreme national interest i think it is a non issue
3312490 and we recognise that if you do unilaterally test there will be international repercussions
3312491 the 123 contains provisions to discuss why you have tested is it because the security situation has undergone a change in this case the us has said that before ceasing cooperation they will examine why a particular thing was done
3312492 the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
3312493 its easier to build a child than repair an adult
3312494 i have college in the u s learn a lot of language skills not all that good
3312495 is just as secure as er can make it maybe 50 000 police and volunteers and reserves and such
3312496 is bad news but a long way from any olympic events athletes or guests to china
3312497 weve never heard of this before we dont know how it got there
3312498 i am pleased that the project totalling 2 7m has had a great deal of support not just from the people involved in making plans come to fruition but also from the public and the friends of peoples park
3312499 a considerable amount of hard work has gone into the restoration of peoples park which has led to a number of significant improvements
3312500 alla vigilia contro lhonduras non ho dormito sono stato sveglio fino alle 4 stavolta far qualcosa di diverso
3312501 but i figure i should step out of my comfort zone to see what goes on in the art capital of the world
3312502 parenthood is the only obligation left in the modern multi open society that cant be renounced
3312503 this is a typical july scenario where you see a sharp drop from june
3312504 last year we saw a 43 percent decline between june and july
3312505 i can see that happening again with the solid number of pending transactions we have right now
3312506 almost all the dealers are offering up to 50 percent off their merchandise so that they wont have to move as much
3312507 well have everything we have now only in a smaller space
3312508 people who used to come in a couple of times a week now come in less and ebay came along and cut into our sales
3312509 we carry triumph and ducati bikes two of the biggest european brands
3312510 up front we have the more modern line of triumph the tiger the speed triple the sprint st the new rocket they range from sport touring bikes naked sport bikes cruisers all the way through to the classics like the bonneville
3312511 the ducati line is more geared towards the sport line ducati gets all its engineering from their racing bikes
3312512 this years version the 696 is a fun riding bike its the lightest bike in its class at about 355 pounds but it puts out a good amount of power thats synonymous with ducati
3312513 then you just hold on because man theyve got some anger behind them
3312514 its hard to stock everything but we can pretty much order anything for anybody
3312515 i started out as a hardcore motorcyclist and a business professional and i spent years traveling around the world as a sales and marketing executive
3312516 after one more merger id been through seven in my career i was over in europe with my wife and i decided that i wanted to do something else
3312517 i said if i could do anything id open up a motorcycle dealership and she said why dont you do it
3312518 one of the only things that i had in my business plan that could truly be catastrophic failure was that if i was unable to get motorcycles from triumph being a one dealer line and thats what happened
3312519 fortunately we heard about that fire early so i literally called up my triumph rep and placed an order of 30 motorcycles and they fulfilled that order which helped carry me through
3312520 having the multiple lines makes us a stronger dealership which is better for our customers as well
3312521 they are super light and small which allows smaller customers particularly women to have a true starter bike that theyll use for a year or two and then grow out of it
3312522 picked up the schwinn line and subsequently the vespa piaggio line
3312523 this is our third season with vespa piaggio and we are literally just about sold out of everything we can get our hands on
3312524 very concerned about style because they get top quality and style with the vespas
3312525 if i was not on route 1 i was not going to be successful because we had dealerships north and south of us
3312526 we endeavor to build the best service team in the northeast and im fairly confident were most of the way there if not all the way there
3312527 the idea behind using a porous pavement is that it allows the saturation of water back to the earth to happen where the water falls
3312528 having more area constructed of a permeable surface allows stormwater and rain to naturally percolate into the earth instead of being forced into detention areas or creating significant runoff conditions
3312529 core physicians is committed to conducting business in a conscious and eco friendly manner
3312530 the responsibility of those who develop properties is changing as we become more sensitive to the benefits of making things sympathetic to the environment
3312531 as a major employer and member of the greater exeter community core physicians takes this commitment seriously and hopes others will follow their example
3312532 traditional methods of treating stormwater runoff are not able to remove the chloride from road salt which not only affects the surrounding plant material but also accelerates the deterioration of most building materials concrete and metals
3312533 the natural snow melting properties of this porous pavement will allow us to use up to 75 percent less salt to safely maintain this parking lot in the winter months
3312534 through the combination of the stone and the sand much of what is picked up in the water is filtered out before the water is absorbed by the ground
3312535 it is gratifying to see that our research results are fast becoming the basis for the standards of practice in stormwater management
3312536 i cannot think of a more holistic setting to integrate the care for people and the environment than a medical facility
3312537 to have one of our local businesses actually implement one of these innovative approaches is just awesome
3312538 we can now point to this project as an example when we try to sell the notion of using porous pavement to different businesses and developers that come before the planning board
3312539 im happy to get the first race jitters sort of out
3312540 the first race is probably one of the most important ones to get it out of your system

3312542 well are you gonna pull them pistols or whistle dixie
3312543 foodies was very well attended last year and this year were moving to a larger venue in order to provide more visitors with more fantastic scottish food and drink experiences im very proud to live in a country with such a rich larder and want to do my part in sharing it with the rest of the world
3312544 we are fortunate that children in alberta and b c with mps ii are receiving enzyme replacement therapy it is urgent that children in ontario have access as well to this treatment
3312545 if szymon doesnt receive the enzyme replacement therapy the progression of the disease will continue
3312546 his organs will be more affected his life expectancy will become shorter and shorter and his quality of life will worsen there will be no more hope for us
3312547 absolutely theres a lot of truth to what the president said and in terms of wall street there was too much leverage in the system and more leverage than was appropriate and more than people recognized because the leverage came into the system in the form of highly complex structured products which were difficult to understand
3312548 there is no question about it wall street got drunk
3312549 thats one reason i asked you to turn off your tv cameras
3312550 the question is how long will it take to sober up and not try to do all these fancy financial instruments
3312551 we have of course one priority getting through this period with as little damage as little negative impact as possible on the economy but the second part is to take steps to reduce the likelihood of these sorts of things happening in the future
3312552 i will do everything i can to make for a smooth transition to work closely with my successor in treasury to do everything i can to help out but im focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19th
3312553 we sized that program to say how could we do something that will be meaningful this year but not so big that it would jeopardize some of our long term priorities and our fiscal priorities in balancing the budget so again my view would be lets see how this program works in the third quarter

3312558 those who had the lowest levels of vitamin d had a 26 percent higher risk of death from all causes compared to those with the highest vitamin d levels
3312559 i think people should optimize their diet and sun exposure to get an adequate level of vitamin d without taking supplements
3312560 it may be a good idea for people who are at risk for vitamin d deficiency including african americans and people who dont spend a lot of time in the sun to get their vitamin d levels checked by their doctor
3312561 we know that being vitamin d sufficient reduces the risk of having your first heart attack by more than 50 percent reduces the risk of having peripheral vascular disease by as much is 80 percent and decreases the risk of prostate colon breast and a whole host of other cancers by as much is 50 to 70 percent

3312643 this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3312644 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3312645 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3312646 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward
3312647 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
3312648 it was not an endorsement and i have no further comment

3312650 at the core are americas working families of all hues and ethnicities whose determination to move forward does not depend on and will not be diverted by the daily twists and turns of this watershed presidential campaign they are taking the long view
3312651 if obamas candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term

3312738 but there were several generations of design evolutions that occurred from that learning experience
3312739 a decision about whether we would build our own wave energy farm
3312740 wave energy sounds like a good idea as long as it doesnt harm the environment
3312741 using the power of the waves seems like a better way of generating power than building oil platforms off the coast
3312742 when you first hear about it you think thats a great idea
3312743 we are guinea pigs for a worldwide science experiment without any rational planning
3312744 its a problem for anyone in charge of proposing a project

3312746 it moves in all directions when the waves come but if it is designed with the right dimensions the motion is quite small
3312747 you are talking about a 10 year time frame to get oil and gas
3312748 from the day you have the permit you can actually have an offshore wind farm within a couple of years

3312750 what is going to be the ultimate use of this land

3312788 a certain nobleman went to a distant country to receive a kingdom for himself and then return
3312789 but his citizens hated him and sent a delegation after him saying we do not want this man to reign over us
3312790 and it came about that when he returned after receiving the kingdom he ordered that these slaves to whom he had given the money be called to him in order that he might know what business they had done
3312791 and the first appeared saying master your talent has made ten talents more
3312792 and he said to him well done good slave because you have been faithful in a very little thing be in authority over ten cities
3312793 and the second came saying your talent master has made five talents
3312794 and he said to him also and you are to be over five cities
3312795 and another came saying master behold your talent which i kept put away in a handkerchief
3312796 he said to him by your own words i will judge you you worthless slave did you know that i am an exacting man taking up what i did not lay down and reaping what i did not sow
3312797 and he said to the bystanders take the talent away from him and give it to the one who has the ten talents
3312798 and they said to him master he has ten talents already
3312799 i tell you that to everyone who has shall more be given but from the one who does not have even what he does have shall be taken away

3312810 e chiaro che almeno per il prossimo futuro il risultato di questo conflitto lannessione alla russia dellossezia del sud e dellabkhazia
3312811 e chiaro che almeno per il prossimo futuro il risultato di questo conflitto lannessione alla russia dellossezia del sud e dellabkhazia la georgia ha sub to un duro colpo alla sua economia e alla sua capacit di attrarre investimenti stranieri oltre a essere stata teatro di una tragedia umanitaria ma ancora troppo presto per dire che la georgia lunica ad aver perso
3312812 ci aspettiamo una reazione molto positiva da parte dei mercati per la fine effettiva delle azioni militari e per i potenziali passi in avanti sulla strada della risoluzione diplomatica del conflitto tuttavia va detto che la crisi non ancora finita
3312813 credo che il fattore della preoccupazione internazionale abbia avuto un certo ruolo non conosciamo per le dinamiche delle politiche interne russe sono certo che al cremlino in corso dietro le quinte un intenso dibattito non mi aspetto una risposta molto forte n unita da parte dellue su questo argomento ci che vedremo con crescente intensit sar una discussione su cosa fare con la russia ma questa una storia che va avanti dal 2004 e altamente improbabile che ora lossezia del sud torni con la georgia
3312814 il cessate il fuoco di oggi non fa differenza la russia ha gi ottenuto la maggior parte l80 di quello che voleva ottenere non riuscita a ottenere un cambio di regime la russia ha dimostrato chiaramente di avere sotto il suo controllo la parte meridionale del caucaso ha consolidato la propria posizione i paesi membri della nato non hanno una visione compatta sulleventuale adesione di georgia e ucraina allalleanza e la russia ne approfitta si tratta di una questione molto seria per lucraina fintantoch lucraina non entra a far parte della nato la russia pu fare quel che vuole questa situazione si pu replicare anche nella regione della crimea schierata con la russia magari non oggi o domani ma nel giro di uno due o tre anni
3312815 si tratta di una notizia molto positiva per il rublo perch la crisi della georgia lunica spiegazione per la debolezza della moneta russa degli ultimi due giorni con la crisi che pare quasi superata il rublo dovrebbe riprendersi dalle perdite patite
3312816 se la notizia che le operazioni militari stanno per essere sospese vera ci di cui ha bisogno il paese e ora ci sono i presupposti per costruire la pace questo un bellissimo paese con gente fantastica che non merita le sofferenze inflitte dalle operazioni militari

3312879 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3312880 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3312881 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3312882 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3312883 i knew when i saw the 1 by my name because at first i thought i saw the clock wrong its a great feeling
3312884 this one has kind of a funny feel about it
3312885 it leaves a bad taste in your mouth it was unnecessary were a small knit group the fact that this was a brand new policy and we werent as aware of it as we should have been they should have had a rules meeting to make us more aware
3312886 we all went around the table a couple of times and said what we thought it ended with us not agreeing with it
3312887 all i was thinking about was that one stroke penalty and it could affect the outcome of the tournament that putt seemed to turn my focus a little bit
3312888 sometimes when you get down in golf its very difficult to rebound
3312889 and megan on the other hand while i was losing my focus she was gaining more focus
3312890 i wish wed been able to play 54 holes its kind of a bummer
3312891 this one has kind of a funny feel about it
3312892 it leaves a bad taste in your mouth it was unnecessary were a small knit group the fact that this was a brand new policy and we werent as aware of it as we should have been they should have had a rules meeting to make us more aware
3312893 we all went around the table a couple of times and said what we thought it ended with us not agreeing with it

3312896 and megan on the other hand while i was losing my focus she was gaining more focus
3312897 i wish wed been able to play 54 holes its kind of a bummer
3312898 im totally surprised its not often a 45 year old can win a race
3312899 its a beautiful town on a beautiful day and the crowds were great
3312900 it was great day it was nice to run in the sun and not the rain
3312901 i definitely had to push because iworsky is good and you knew you had pressure behind you
3312902 i took it out hard because i saw a bunch of high school kids cross country kids
3312903 so i thought theyd take it out hard but they must have been on break or something because i found myself alone behind the police cruiser
3312904 the first part of the race went great i was right where i wanted to be at 5 52 for the first mile and then i just started slowing down i dont know what happened
3312905 it could be because im training for a triathlon next weekend and ive been spending more time on the bike and less time on the road and my legs felt it mastin was getting closer and if it wouldve been another mile he probably wouldve taken me
3312906 it wasnt my fastest time but it was a good time and ill take it
3312907 at the third mile i figured if i can still run go for it and i never looked back
3312908 i dont get too competitive in that respect i just try to run and hold on and do the best i can do
3312909 its a good course with some flat spots that lets you push a little bit
3312910 im glad to come here and not screw it up
3312911 i think those generally lingering around 30 do pretty well but give me five years
3312912 and guys like kenny kimber and anthony bernard they keep getting younger and we keep getting older so eventually its got to come to an end but its fun while it lasts

3312914 we played really flat when we came out at the beginning of the game and then picked up the intensity
3312915 and then from there on we started rebounding being aggressive and making more shots
3312916 we werent playing as hard and they were working us early no doubt about that
3312917 i called a timeout and told them that and they immediately started playing better and that was the difference they brought their intensity level up and they kept it up for the rest of the game

3312933 i can guarantee it wont be like that the rest of the tournament
3312934 hopefully i get rid of it soon and get back to where i should be starting obviously this is not what i was looking to happen at all
3312935 im totally surprised its not often a 45 year old can win a race

3312948 september 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the orion
3312949 having some number of months of schedule flexibility to meet our commitment in addition to having some number of months of cost flexibility is key to keeping ourselves in a healthy posture
3312950 as we looked at the plan we had for september 2013 against the available dollars it became clear to us that we needed to adjust our schedules
3312951 we are sending communication to all customers who have downloaded the software and we are aggressively working on a fix which should be within a short timeframe

3312953 we know who they are and were going to contact them
3312954 we cannot give an exact time frame but it should be within a few days but i cannot give an exact date right now

3313144 the toilets and square have been very well received locally and we are already getting many favourable comments from residents even if people do not want to use them they are still having a look in they have become a real local attraction
3313145 the location right outside the parish office means we are well placed to keep an eye on them and we have also expressed an interest in being involved with the contract monitoring as part of the empowerment pilot
3313146 we are also working with iw council with a view to installing a static cctv camera on our office building to cover the entrances to the toilets all this work has come about under the parish empowerment project and is a great example of what can be achieved when the two bodies work in close partnership

3313183 peterborough will be here as underdogs and weve got to be really careful as we know as the favourites and the bigger team you can come unstuck
3313184 first off they wouldnt burn out your battery would die first second you could see if the switch was turned on
3313185 ill give the battery a jump you get in and try it when i say when
3313186 you mean to tell me youve never jumped a battery before
3313187 i imagine ive done that about as many times as youve made chicken cordon bleu
3313188 see theres a first time for everything just walk me through the procedure step by step would you i may be untaught but im far from unteachable
3313189 your battery is corroded its a wonder your engine has started at all lately
3313190 sorry but back off a little i need some space to think
3313191 yeah maybe but id rather not crud up my cables and jumping that mess of a battery really wouldnt fix the real problem it would be like treating cancer with aspirin how about a free tow instead
3313192 whats the catch i mean you dont even like me
3313193 well you want to stay here or can i take you and your van somewhere
3313194 im fairly new in town and dont know any good car repairmen
3313195 what are you some kind of neanderthal you think because of my chromosomes i cant fix a minivan
3313196 you called yourself a repairman and i only said that you arent a man thats a fact despite your dress and demeanor you are very much a woman
3313197 ks3 is an important stepping stone to success at further study and life beyond the classroom it is encouraging that most pupils are achieving at or above the expected standard for their age in all three subjects and almost a third are now achieving the highest levels in maths
3313198 but i am disappointed by the slight drops in english and science reversing the rises of last year we know there is more to do before all of our schools are truly world class and that every young person is reaching their full potential at age 14 and beyond
3313199 we are giving schools the tools they need massive investment in support for teachers more support for childrens wider needs and the new secondary curriculum starting next month which will give them real flexibility over how they teach and the confidence to intervene earlier to give support to the right children at the right time in the right way
3313200 it is understandable why the government has chosen not to publish the provisional local authority figures for ks3 given ets failures
3313201 however it is puzzling that the ks2 figures have been published no results can be relied upon particularly in light of the high number of appeals and missing results
3313202 it is now time to call a halt to the sats and have a fundamental and independent review of assessment
3313203 the ks3 tests are an irrelevance no one will be interested in the results when young people apply for a job
3313204 in a year when sats have collapsed under their own weight cutting the ks3 tests would be an excellent way to reduce the excessive amount of testing our students face
3313205 the government continues to miss its modest targets and we are left with the unacceptable position that two out of five 14 year olds are failing to achieve the necessary grades in reading writing and maths that they will need to be able to achieve at gcse
3313206 only seven in 10 children are now reaching the expected grade in science at age 14 but three years ago when this same cohort was eleven 86 reached the expected level
3313207 clearly something is going very wrong in the first three years of secondary school in this vital subject
3313208 its a disgrace that on the day the results have been published many schools will still not yet have received their marked papers
3313209 the shambles surrounding the marking of this years tests undermines the credibility of these results the government must waive the re marking costs to schools for this years exams

3313239 some very serious questions to answer on his return to australia
3313240 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses she said
3313241 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3313242 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3313243 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election ms bishop said
3313244 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here
3313245 weve already had five ministers resign since the last election how many more would be resigning if wed heard from the ccc on this governments shady dealings ms bishop said

3313248 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace medvedev said at a televised meeting
3313249 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored he said at the meeting with defence minister anatoly serdyukov and the head of the militarys general staff nikolai makarov
3313250 the aggressor has been punished and suffered significant losses he said

3313253 it is a distraction and simply untrue to claim that i have only been concerned about the lack of engagement with muslim councillors in the preventing violent extremism agenda pve
3313254 i have been concerned about the lack of engagement with all councillors as evidenced by the written question i submitted to the council meeting on 10th june 2008
3313255 furthermore the response to date to invite me to private meetings is inadequate and misses the point of transparency these issues need to be aired in public and all councillors should have access to information relating to the pve agenda as it affects all communities in birmingham
3313256 it is clear that even cllr rudges senior coalition partners in the lib dems are unaware of any details relating to this sensitive area for example deputy leader of lib dems tariq khan confirmed that he had not received any briefings
3313257 no councillors seemed to know about the preventing extremism conference on 21st october being promoted by the private consultancy firm waterhouse on their website claiming to be endorsed by birmingham city council
3313258 the abusive adjectives used to describe me ludicrous and ego driven have been deployed as a smokescreen to distract from the real issues which still need to be addressed cllr rudge could begin by answering these initial questions
3313259 what examples are there of keeping elected members in birmingham informed of the pve agenda and how regular have any of these been
3313260 how often has the pve project board met and how are minutes accessed
3313261 how do people learn how and where to access the funding what is the process of acceptance and rejection
3313262 have all projects over 10 000 been tendered externally as per protocol requirement
3313263 how much has waterhouse consultancy been paid by birmingham city council for work on the pve agenda and how much are they due to be paid
3313264 where is the report waterhouse consultancy were commissioned to do was there a tendering process for this
3313265 what was the deadline for this report what auditing expertise does waterhouse consultancy have to have carried out an evaluation
3313266 it may well be that there are perfectly reasonable answers to these and other questions

3313282 the russians planned it they purposefully attacked during the olympics
3313283 there are people in the white house who ought to pay for this provocation
3313284 they may have calculated that some people would leave the region and flee north to north ossetia but the rest would stay and the problem would basically be resolved
3313285 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it

3313288 ukrainians and mercenaries from the baltics as well as nationals from other countries were involved in the fighting as foreigners have been found among their bodies
3313289 in yesterdays most recent tank attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today americans who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
3313290 some say this is propaganda some say this is true what do you say
3313291 we hear a lot of propaganda weve heard the u s gave the green light to this operation i have nothing specific with regard to these report but i would not conclude that they are true we did not have any prior knowledge or were not consulted by georgia
3313292 not necessarily buy the line that georgia initiated a conflict
3313293 we want to immediately end this military confrontation we want to end the war which we have not launched we want to stop russias intervention
3313294 opinions are like assholes every one has one and thinks others all stink
3313295 is it true that russian troops have ignored georgian sovereignty
3313296 how is that different from us troops invading the sovereign state of iraq
3313297 this is an occupation half of georgia is under russian control our aim now is to build up our troops and to create a defensive line in front of tbilisi
3313298 let me say at this point that there are no good solutions either we have to try to remove them the russians by force or accept a humiliating defeat

3313327 wed go from helping and stabilizing to engaging in full combat
3313328 it would change every day especially because we didnt know who the bad guy was or what his weapon was
3313329 hes made a great career out of what hes done
3313330 it was his calling and its probably one of the best decisions he ever made
3313331 his direct involvement with the iraqi army led to their validation to independent operations
3313332 his concept of partnership with the iraqi army and police forces facilitated an unprecedented union between coalition and iraqi security forces
3313333 the progress is being made but its small steps that you have to accept
3313334 the people there are getting the desire it takes to rule themselves its just going to take time to get the stability built up there
3313335 they looked pretty startled when they ran out the door

3313342 i led a busy life as a wife mother and professional teacher i would abandon it for long periods of time but i would always come back to it
3313343 i decided that its my purpose in life because its the only thing i can sit at for hours on end and get so involved in that i forget to even eat

3313346 the iphone meets our minimum requirements and can be moved to the appliance support level which means support is limited to a narrow set of applications such as voice email personal information manager and browsing

3313348 must employ previously released methods such as imap internet message access protocol in the concierge support level or await third party products that can tie into the security policy features delivered with the firmware 2 0 upgrade
3313349 the device can be wiped clean via the issuance of a standard instruction from exchange and can force the use of a complex password if the alphanumeric setting is checked on the exchange 2003 sp2 or 2007 administrative console
3313350 the iphone reacts similarly to a windows mobile device clearing contents when the security policy is violated
3313351 microsoft uses a confusing approach assuming that the end device will decide on what type of password will be enforced when the policy is received by the device there is no feedback to the console that the policy has been enforced windows mobile interprets the alphanumeric parameter as an instruction to force the user to employ a complex password the iphone replicates this function in the same manner despite microsofts awkward implementation
3313352 we are also concerned about this not full stadium issue

3313365 its setting us back its purposeful and hateful to people that have disabilities
3313366 it means we can be afraid of things we dont know and use words without thinking and without repercussions were not against humor we love humor but lets understand the humor that were using
3313367 our message is pretty clear we need people with intellectual disabilities portrayed with humanity and dignity
3313368 we dont think its fair that this population is singled out
3313369 the word and the portrayal of a mentally challenged person are a source of ridicule
3313370 it makes people a combination of furious and just really disturbed at the end of the day this has to be a teachable moment its not about the movie its about being sensitive to the human dignity of others
3313371 this film is so offensive that it brought several organizations together
3313372 as far as im concerned the whole thing is a satire
3313373 i think its perfectly fine there was no harm involved it wasnt done meanly in satire everybody gets a little banged up thats the whole point of it

3313379 he always does in races i saw his time was incredibly strong in the 400 freestyle i knew going into the last 50 meter i wanted to have a good lead on him
3313380 it was an emotional relay i had to force myself to out it out of my head i have so many races so much to do in every race i have to keep 100 percent focused no matter how good that race was you have to force it out of your head if we had to do that race again im not sure we could it was the perfect race at the perfect time
3313381 hes pushed us and weve all pushed each other the way hes pushed us hopefully elevates everyone else
3313382 i had my doubts after yesterday because everyone was swimming so well winning never gets old really it feels like the first time i always train to be able to win on my worst day and i knew what i had to do to get my hand on the wall
3313383 i dont know if its just his shoulder strength he always takes the most water with him he beat the field by half a second he said it was a close race but he kind of killed us hes a very cool guy i dont think he lets nerves get to him as much as most do

3313393 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3313394 russias actions have substantially damaged its reputation in the world
3313395 when one country conquers another that is typically regarded as pretty serious and the inability to do anything about it is something the united states is not accustomed to
3313396 theres really nothing that george w bush can or would or should do
3313397 this is no time for the united states to step up to the plate in any meaningful way unilaterally because what seems to be happening here once you sort through all the rhetoric is this is sort of the cold war coming back
3313398 one of the arguments against exercise is that it could be hard on my joints that i am going to become crippled in my old age and that my knees are going to have worn out and that is just not true
3313399 over the past 20 years weve seen the benefit of remaining active and running really does engage us to improve our overall wellness
3313400 the one race we all do at the same pace is aging but where we can be an olympian in life is to make sure you stay active and enjoy your longevity more
3313401 i enjoy the running because it allows me the ability to enjoy the fresh air clear my head and feel better physically emotionally and mentally
3313402 what i am saying is that you are never too old and you are never too sick to start running
3313403 even for those with couch potato status now you too can become an athlete if you approach it with intelligence
3313404 as long as you get your heart rate up several times during the week to where you are sweating it seems that will provide the benefits

3313413 there are many reasons to keep the two exchanges running first of all at this stage we are not duplicating contracts which could happen in the long run the second reason is that by keeping in two groups sheikh mohammed has the comfort that both of them are running really fast because competitiveness brings quality

3313480 said himself he thinks that it isnt necessarily the right moment given the olympic games for a meeting with the president
3313481 they should know georgia will never surrender i directly accuse russia of ethnic cleansing
3313482 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3313483 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3313484 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3313485 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3313486 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3313487 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3313488 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3313489 i have reached a decision to halt the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3313490 the aggressor has been punished and has incurred very significant losses its armed forces are disorganized
3313491 it is not part of our culture it is not what we do
3313492 weve started to get reports of this from speaking to people sleeping rough and police who have met people with bottles of the gel
3313493 a lot of it has been anecdotal so far but its something thats come onto our radar and we have been looking into it ourselves over the past three months

3313511 artists feed each other not just through critique which we do but when you paint with someone you get ideas you are inspired by each others work it is enriching
3313512 different things come up like when do you stop painting when is the painting done or what do you do when you are having a slump or your muse is gone we can discuss these things when we are together
3313513 watercolors werent vibrant enough i wanted the intense color of pastels

3313522 mike watkinson was the spin bowler at the time then we had chris schofield come along and then murali and i have just stuck in there
3313523 but the more experience i have gained and the more games i have played i have tried to take on a key role as a spinner and had a couple of good seasons
3313524 i have had frustrations along the way with not getting selected so i have just tried to hang in there and 500 is a good milestone for me
3313525 i think as a bowler you set yourself little milestones there is this thing in county cricket where 1 000 runs and 50 wickets seems to be the benchmark for a season but if you dont play every game it is quite hard to achieve
3313526 if i get one wicket in the first innings and two in the second i will get 50 wickets a year but i have not really done anything so i think contributions in matches how you can affect a match is more important milestones along the way are nice but i would prefer to contribute to a match situation rather than notching up personal wickets as nice as it is
3313527 i keep saying to myself i am due a big haul but i cant bowl any better than i have bowled this year
3313528 stuey law forever keeps telling me to keep going and it will come
3313529 as the wickets do get drier you do put more pressure on yourself to be the wicket taker
3313530 as long as i remain focused on what i am trying to do
3313531 sajid mahmood glen chapple and dominic cork have been outstanding this year and throw stephen croft myself and francois du plessis in there around that if we can all do a job as well as we have done for the rest of the season it doesnt matter who gets the wickets really
3313532 i have not resigned myself to the fact that i will not play for england
3313533 i get the question every year and it is the same answer i just try and keep doing well for lancashire and put myself up there and if anything came it would be a bonus for me
3313534 throughout my career i have gone in at 11 and tried to hang around for the guy who is in
3313535 i have played with some great players who have been on 120 or 90 or 70 and i have just tried to bat for them if i get out playing a stupid shot they are stranded
3313536 i practice in the nets as hard as anybody and this year i have tried to play a few more shots off balls i think i can score off you get to 10 and then 20 and you think i am in here and it frustrates the bowling
3313537 we are here to tell nana akufo addo that this is the time for a woman to be selected
3313538 we also want to assure nana of our support for a female running mate and encourage him to go in for alima mahama and not allow himself to be persuaded by the anti alima lobbyists within the npp
3313539 if the party says she is the one i will take her
3313540 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3313541 we dont know yet whether it was damaged its a second attempt to bomb this pipeline since august 10
3313542 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3313543 i was out in open water and i was out of the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me

3313566 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3313567 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers
3313568 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes

3313583 the old chimney stacks which were part of the brewery were burnt badly and ive been watching the firemen pouring water on it to try to save the college building
3313584 it was a bit of a shock to wake up to this there was a huge amount of smoke
3313585 we believe it began in the kitchen and rapidly spread but thanks to the quick response by crews we were able to control the fire quite quickly
3313586 in a street like this with very old buildings we have to act swiftly to stop any spread of a large fire such as this
3313587 we have officers on the roof of the christs college building opposite which has been scorched to stop the fire spreading to it
3313588 we responded quickly and it took us about 30 minutes to get it under control now we are using the turntable ladder and hoses to dampen it down and stop any spread
3313589 we have no indication as yet as to how it started no one was in the building at the time as far as we aware
3313590 there were plumes of smoke right round the back of the pub and covering the sky
3313591 it was pretty shocking stuff there has been a huge response by the fire service but i suppose you have to be extra careful in an old street like this
3313592 i was in the gala club around the corner cleaning when it all started

3313595 i have the opportunity to bring back to audience the kind of hero they had in the 70s someone as dark and conflicted as the new james bond or the dark knight
3313596 our intention is to tell a single story over three films and this first chapter is a guy who makes a massive revelation
3313597 we have completed a considerable part of the operation to force georgian authorities toward peace in south ossetia
3313598 tskhinvali has been taken under control by a reinforced russian peacekeeping force
3313599 i will remind you that history has plenty of examples of pacifying an aggressor western countries were engaged in this 70 years ago
3313600 of course saddam hussein had to be hung for his destruction of several shiite villages but as for the current georgian leadership who in one hour razed 10 ossetian villages to the ground who crushed children and the elderly with tanks who burned alive peaceful citizens in barns these activists should of course be protected
3313601 if my memory serves me right it was ronald reagan who said in relation to one of latin america dictators a while ago somoza of course is a son of a bitch
3313602 a lot has changed since that time the world has dramatically changed the cold war is no more but this mentality of the cold war is deeply ingrained in the heads of some of american diplomats
3313603 we do not have any initiative to invade anywhere we are performing peacekeeping functions
3313604 our clear position is to keep the status of peacekeepers
3313605 this is a usual practice in such conflicts recall the u s bombings of serbia or iraq in the late 1990s

3313617 following an approach by local media avon fire and rescue service has confirmed reports that a fire alarm activated in the pavilion building at grand pier at 01 35am on monday 28 july
3313618 however this information forms part of the ongoing investigation and the cause of the fire remains unknown
3313619 i am not prepared to speculate about anything ahead of the publication of the official report into the cause of the fire
3313620 i have every confidence in the investigation being carried out jointly between the police the fire service and insurers and i am sure we will all know exactly what happened in due course until that time i urge everyone to avoid speculation as it only causes further distress to those involved
3313621 obviously the investigators need to reach a conclusion and write their report without hindrance from speculation that could prejudice the outcome

3313624 once i heard the whole shit was remixes i backed away i didnt wanna disappoint the real clipse fans who were in love with the original joints
3313625 i was fresh off three big checks from wayne and the album release and i was feeling myself and they came waving very very short dollars
3313626 not saying that there arent dope cats who dont charge but they didnt have access to them
3313627 the fans wanted the album bad and all the shit i had in the pipeline was months away so i needed something to keep my name out
3313628 i had already fucked off the whole joint and the official sony release is still months away too so i had to have something new hit the streets i had other hot weezy shit i couldve leaked out but i figured id hold on to that and do a clipse joint because i had already been mentioning it in press and i had to make good on my word
3313629 he knew it would be a great look and a super lead up to my joint on the clipse album
3313630 but i admit i dropped the ball caught up in the weezy hype i had heat and full creative control but i allowed the business to get in the way of my art itll never happen again though

3313687 abensotaich m sico y cantor de la primitiva escuela de la meca y medina era tuerto calvo lagrimoso y enfermizo
3313688 los artistas eran populares en el sentido de que proced an de clases bajas como que su oficio estaba descalificado
3313689 hijo de carnicero anduvo cantando en pregones por las calles de cufa la carne de su padre
3313690 ambos proced an del bajo pueblo de cura eran rudos sucios e innobles individuos
3313691 dicen que lshac de la escuela de bagdad introdujo la voz de falsete o la voz de los castrados ten a mucha facilidad art stica mucho gusto para cantar pero su voz natural no te acompa aba para cantar
3313692 la mayor parte de sus mejores cantos comenzaban por una nota aguda y fuerte hasta el extremo de que te pusieron un mote despectivo el picado por escorpi n pues principiaba gritando en sus m s bonitas canciones

3313694 se introducen en la corte damascena el vino y la m sica que antes y despu s dentro del islamismo han sido compa eros inseparables
3313695 el gusto de la m sica se hab a extendido tanto y la m sica se hab a popularizado a tal extremo que en una ciudad andaluza no pod a encontrarse barrio calle ni rinc n silencioso en que pudiese una persona verse libre de o r por todas partes instrumentos de m sica y canciones en qu parte del mundo en qu ciudad ocurrir a semejante fen meno en el siglo xl
3313696 en sevilla realmente estaba el foco de la m sica espa ola sobre todo en un barrio poblad simo que almot mid hermose obligando a sus moradores a que blanquearan las casas especialmente las que caen al r o y renov con medidas de polic a urbana que dieron a ese barrio aspecto seductor con sus dorados ventanales
3313697 a espa a lleg la m sica oriental en el momento en que se hab a iniciado ya la decadencia en oriente con todos los refinamientos cortesanos tra da desde los tiempos de ziriab por artistas patatinos pero el pueblo espa ol al asimil rsela tuvo la virtud de devolverle la sencillez sac ndola de los salones y palacios para traerla a la plaza convirti ndola en espect culo popular no s lo adapt ndola al gusto del pueblo que le pagaba y aplaud a sino moldeando su forma art stica de modo especial al ser conquistadas las ciudades moras se romper an todos los la des c taras flautas y rabeles y enmudecer an todas las gargantas de hombres mujeres y chicos insan a fuera el imaginarlo los moriscos que permanecieron tras la conquista en tierras cristianas en multitud inmensa esparcida por toda la pen nsula continuaron cantando y tocando su m sica rabe tradicional no s lo la lastimera y triste que es la que se nos figura m s adecuada a su nueva situaci n de vencidos y dominados sino tambi n la alegre y festiva que es la que podr a servirles para consuelo en sus tribulaciones y olvido de sus pesares
3313698 estos bailes pueden dividirse en tres grandes familias que seg n su condici n y car cter pueden ser o de origen morisco espa ol o americano pero entre todos estos bailes y cantares merecen llamar la atenci n los que conservan su filiaci n rabe y morisca
3313699 la m sica con que se cantan estos romances es un recuerdo morisco todav a s lo en muy pocos pueblos de la serran a de ronda o de tierra de medina y jerez es donde se conserva esta tradici n rabe que se va extinguiendo poco a poco y desaparecer para siempre lo apartado de comunicaci n en que se encuentran estos pueblos de la serran a y el haber en ellos fam lias conocidas por descendientes de moriscos explican la conservaci n de estos recuerdos
3313700 las costumbres la educaci n y el g nero de vida contribuyen sin duda a ello y tienen en verdad estos cantares no poco de oriental en su fondo y en su forma como en adelante tendr ocasi n de advertir y como se observa tambi n en los h bitos de mucha parte de nuestro pa s que estuvo en contacto con los moriscos hasta una poca m s reciente
3313701 la idea que hoy tienen en espa a de esta raza de los gitanos es que son los descendientes de los moriscos que permanecen en espa a vagando por montes y despoblados desde que el cuerpo principal de la naci n fue expulsado del pa s en tiempos de felipe ill
3313702 5 el autor que con m s ah nco y vehemencia ha defendido hasta ahora el nexo de uni n la analog a entre lo flamenco y los moriscos es sin duda alguna blas infante
3313703 unas bandas errantes perseguidas con sa a pero sobre las cuales no pesa el anatema de la expulsi n y de la muerte vagan ahora de lugar en lugar y constituyen comunidades dirigidas por jerarcas y abiertas a todo desesperado peregrino lanzado de la sociedad por la desgracia y el crimen
3313704 6 son numerosos los estudiosos del fen meno flamenco que han intentado averiguar la etimolog a de la palabra
3313705 7 el tema de la convivencia de gitanos y moriscos etc en relaci n con la g nesis del cante flamenco lo vemos planteado de una manera casi constante en toda la literatura flamenca tal sucede con rafael lafuente en los gitanos lo flamenco y los flamencos
3313706 la analog a de nuestra m sica bailes cantos y hasta palabras con las de los rabes andaluces confirma la relaci n ntima con el cante jondo el acompa amiento de la guitarra que subraya las melod as con sucesiones peri dicas regulares de acordes como sucede en el flamenco fue caracter stico de los rabes el tocar las palmas los espectadores resultando as elementos activos que se conjuntan con los bailaores fue costumbre usada en las antiguas zambras moriscas el animar al cantador o bailador con palabras y hasta el cl sico ol fue usado tambi n por ellos con el wa la h tan corriente y familiar expresi n suya
3313707 la verdad es que todo el problema morisco en relaci n con el flamenco debe ser sometido a revisi n
3313708 hay otro hecho para m decisivo en todo lo que conocemos de los or genes del cante no hay ning n dato ning n nombre que nos recuerde a lo morisco
3313709 por lo dem s en la amplia n mina de cantaores de los primeros tiempos que ha llegado a nosotros casi todos gitanos como tantas veces hemos dicbo no hay un solo nombre de morisco
3313710 la comunidad morisca comprender a entonces antes de la expulsi n entre 340 000 y 350 000 almas e incluso m s el grupo no afectado por la expulsi n fue m s importante de lo que hasta aqu se ha cre do
3313711 un hombre prudente y conocedor de la realidad muley en su
3313712 es l cito deducir que en antequera lo mismo que en sevilla en m laga y otras ciudades bastantes moriscos granadinos cautivos o descendientes suyos permanecieron mezclados con los aut nticos moros de berber a
3313713 estaban totalmente libres de moriscos porque declarados horros se trasladaron a diversas casas y corrales de vecindad
3313714 si en la misma granada ciudad en que funcionaba la inquisicion pudo ocurrir esto qu ocurrir a en el campo para m contin a es evidente que tiene que haber all muchos descendientes de moros y jud os por la permanencia de instituciones usos estilos etc que pueden considerarse moriscos
3313715 sali del consejo real dos d as pasados un decreto en que nadie fuese osado maltratar a los moriscos que se hab an quedado ni se les hiciere agravio alguno como vivan veinte leguas de la marina tierra adentro
3313716 tras la expulsi n definitiva nos dice el elemento morisco aunque de forma clandestina y subterr nea no ha dejado de pesar en la antropolog a racial y cultural de nuestro pa s o por lo menos de algunas regiones
3313717 pero fue en andaluc a donde quedaron m s moriscos fundamentalmente por dos causas una la gran extensi n que tom la esclavitud otra las mejores relaciones entre cristianos nuevos y viejos
3313718 un grupo de estas mujeres y hombres ten an entre sus manos una guitarra sus cantos en nada se parec an a los de los cristianos que viv an en las ciudades civilizadas
3313719 si yo lo supiera que t a m no me quer as renegara de dios me fuera a ba ar a la morer a
3313720 los moriscos son toda gente miserable trabajadora y jornaleros del campo
3313721 si tal vez no habr a que relacionar la modesta ferrer a gitana con la morisca
3313722 no hay un solo nombre de morisco entre los cantaores flamencos
3313723 la fortuna acumulada por el clero y los funcionarios proven a en gran parte de exacciones cometidas durante decenios en detrimento de los moriscos el elemento m s hostil dentro del clero estuvo representado junto con algunos prelados y rdenes mon sticas por el bajo clero
3313724 cuando voy a confes digo lo que me parece nunca digo la verdad
3313725 a un morisco apretado de la enfermedad fue aconfesar el cura y comulg le tambi n despu s le dijo como le faltara otro sacramento por recibir del santo leo si lo ped a a la iglesia el morisco m s afligido con esto que con el mal dijo pues tres tormentos en un d a confesi n comuni n y leo

3313766 this is not a typical activist investment idea no one is going to get board seats on microsofts board

3313768 are arguably two of the best businesses in the world
3313769 they have a monopoly position although they are facing upstart challenges from apple aapl and google goog respectively
3313770 this threat has been diminished in recent years see the flop of appletv
3313771 they are fighting a ghost of the past with this division and it is time to let it go
3313772 would clearly signal to the market that there is a limit to microsofts willingness to invest in the online business without seeing profits
3313773 such a company would be free to strategically attack the online advertising market as it sees fit and complete mergers with its own currency

3313817 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3313818 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3313819 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3313820 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3313821 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3313822 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3313823 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3313824 this is a planning took where all things are going
3313825 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3313826 well if hes as good as he says he is he wont be elected if hes elected hes definitely not as good as he says he is
3313827 it was a bit nerve wracking watching the guys follow but i was happy i had done a good run and that was all that i could do

3313829 all three cities already had special projects underway aimed at e enabling certain parts of the city and were working closely with local universities to achieve this aim
3313830 but we decided to join forces along with a number of private companies to develop a set of tools aimed specifically at facilitating citizen communication
3313831 these are citizen based tools designed by citizens and for citizens but that can also be accessed by city authorities in order to improve their services
3313832 one of the concerns for administrations is that they do not want to dismantle their existing communications infrastructure our platform can be simply wrapped around the existing structure to provide an extra service layer this limits the costs involved in implementing it
3313833 has so far collected over 2 billion in airport rent since the countrys airports were spun off to non profit authorities in the mid 1990s
3313834 we worked on head mounted displays improved tiled displays rendering and streaming software colour calibration techniques collaboration and networking and novel interaction systems
3313835 better yet the handheld model can also block out daylight so you dont get the usual problem of sunlight washing out the image it is a breakthrough and the daylight blocking hmd will feature this month at siggraph 2008 in los angeles
3313836 it takes a lot of processing power to render a virtual image onto a real landscape mobile device cpus cannot really cope we developed a video streaming protocol that allows a desktop to perform the rendering but then streams a compressed signal across wireless networks
3313837 we are already in discussion with some companies about commercial opportunities for the rendering platform
3313838 in contrast to marker based tracking where we track labels with patterns on it in marker less tracking we detect feature points in real scenes and compare current images from a camera to calibrated reference images of the same scene to calculate the current position of a user
3313839 you get big calibration problems with projectors on multi tiled displays because projectors vary or projector bulbs deteriorate at different rates it affects image quality but our calibration tool ensures faithful colour across the multiple screens
3313840 the mix of applications meant we had to develop low cost but high performance systems the tests were successful and the system performed well
3313841 it is unlikely that the platform will be commercialised as one product but most of the components will have direct commercial potential and many of them are a real advance on what is currently available
3313842 we are delighted to have such a highly rated player at hibs for the season

3313845 going through my music collection seeking songs for the mix tape i kept discovering examples i hadnt considered i was taken aback by just how much of a rip off artist i really was but there they were plain as day song after song i had copied in one way or another perhaps i wasnt an original songwriter after all but a lousy cover act hoping my frankensteins monster reassembled cover versions would not be noticeable

3313867 this method coupled with adsorbed soil gas and carbon isotope studies suggests that hydrocarbon micro seepage of subsurface origin is present in the area and indicates that the area is worth visiting for conventional petroleum exploration
3313868 we plan to carry out detailed soil sampling in the region after the rains
3313869 it can be integrated with geological geochemical and geophysical methods to evaluate the hydrocarbon prospect of an area and to prioritize the drilling locations thereby reducing drilling risks
3313870 the geological and geophysical studies reveal that tadpatri shales can be a potential source rocks for hydrocarbons having the essential prerequisites such as their undisturbed nature favourable for the generation and accumulation of hydrocarbons
3313871 are very interesting and we have been able to discover two zones in the basin rich with hydrocarbon

3313878 they have given us no playing kit they expect us to play in the kit that they have given to all the other teams to use for leisure wear its ridiculous
3313879 can you imagine what it would be like for our players to be playing in these in this humidity
3313880 surely we can at least expect to be given clothes that are comfortable and suitable to play in the way they have organised this is diabolical no one knew what they would be wearing before we got to beijing you should see the shorts jeff coetzee his doubles partner was given they go right down to here
3313881 he cant play in clothes like that it would be impossible for him
3313882 the australians had all the kit they needed weeks before sorted out into individual boxes they were able to sort out any problems they might have had before getting here i have never seen anything like this in my life its a disgrace
3313883 so be it someone has got to come out and talk about this

3313942 the georgian military attacked the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali with multiple rocket launchers designed to devastate large areas
3313943 russia had to respond to accuse it of aggression against small defenseless georgia is not just hypocritical but shows a lack of humanity
3313944 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3313945 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3313946 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3313947 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3313948 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3313949 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3313950 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3313951 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3313980 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
3313981 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
3313982 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
3313983 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
3313984 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
3313985 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
3313986 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
3313987 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
3313988 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
3313989 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
3313990 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
3313991 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
3313992 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
3313993 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
3313994 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
3313995 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
3313996 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
3313997 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
3313998 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
3313999 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
3314000 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
3314001 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
3314002 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
3314003 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
3314004 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
3314005 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
3314006 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
3314007 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
3314008 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
3314009 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

3314021 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3314022 our goal is to free the kodori gorge of georgian troops
3314023 today the assault begins it is a high mountain operation
3314024 we are entering a new stage with about 3 000 troops with artillery aviation and infantry reinforcements
3314025 on the basis of your report i have taken the decision to bring to an end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3314026 presently more than nine of every 10 sowetans buy from local soweto retailers
3314027 whereas approximately 20 percent of household goods and services are purchased from businesses located outside soweto almost half of sowetans purchases are from new or established retail malls or centres in soweto
3314028 almost 60 percent of sowetans shop at new or established retail malls on saturdays
3314029 also due to many sowetans still working outside soweto shoppers tend to rather engage in top up or fill up shopping than bulk shopping outside soweto

3314260 russland ist in einen souver nen nachbarstaat eingefallen und bedroht eine demokratische regierung die vom volk gew hlt wurde solch eine aktion ist nicht akzeptabel im 21 jahrhundert
3314261 vorher gab es so gut wie keine armee in georgien
3314262 f r georgien sind die usa der wichtigste westliche verb ndete noch wichtiger als die eu die usa haben ma geblich an der modernisierung der georgischen streitkr fte mitgewirkt
3314263 diese bem hungen werden den weltweiten kampf gegen den terror unterst tzen und die lage im kaukasus stabilisieren

3314272 id like to think ive made some people pause reflect and reconsider ideas and assumptions they held as true but it would be na ve to think that everyone who clicked on to the page now thinks differently
3314273 of course theres a lot of anger and misunderstanding for many reasons but thats why i embarked on this project
3314274 i wanted to engage people and present the other side of the argument
3314275 look different dress differently worship in a different way and live in the same community as them

3314293 as far as i know at this time two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get an education who have both worked hard done extremely well and graduated with good degrees have been killed

3314296 we havent recovered the weapons from the scene so we are basing what kind of weapons were used on pathological evidence and that is not an exact science

3314298 gegeven de reactieve aard van de huidige malware en anti virus detectie zijn zelfs de beste virusscanners in het nadeel om bij te blijven omdat anti virus oplossingen voornamelijk al ge dentificeerde dreigingen kunnen detecteren worden die snel door aangepaste versies vervangen en gebruiken criminelen deze periode om nietsvermoedende machines te infecteren

3314356 you want to win cause you want the pride of wearing those green jerseys
3314357 to go out and win those green jerseys was important for us
3314358 the offense had a two minute situation and b j made a game winning catch
3314359 even though the offense was ahead we still had to go down and score and he made a great catch in the end zone
3314360 people always ask about the receiving corps and im not worried about that b j made some great plays mark dell you know he is going to make plays he made some sunday and made plays as a true freshman blair white made some plays he made an amazing catch a lynn swan type catch yesterday over a defender so receiver is not an area of concern for us
3314361 i thought i saw some good things from our quarterbacks
3314362 probably as good a scrimmage totally as a quarterback group as we have had
3314363 i was in cover 3 and i saw hoyer dropping back and i knew b j likes to run the post so i read it and i broke on the ball and got the pick
3314364 otis wiley and somebody else were in front of me so otis blocked one of the lineman and hoyer tried to tackle me but i cut inside and scored
3314365 im not sure how its going to be for the opener but the competition right now is great at linebacker
3314366 its going to take all of us to win games and have a successful season
3314367 two to three day injuries there are no serious ones
3314368 it just seemed like he wasnt on his a game and we were able to take advantage of that
3314369 im locating my fastball now and that makes things a little easier for me
3314370 we played like youd like to see about 95 games a year
3314371 we pitched well we hit the ball in key situations and we played some good defense
3314372 there is an urgent need to foster innovation as the world is inching closer to the goal of eradicating dreadful diseases especially for the early childhood by providing effective vaccines
3314373 we are planning to hire 25 000 people in the current fiscal and among them 18 000 would be hired through campus recruitment
3314374 the third and fourth quarters would be the time when the firm tends to tighten up its hiring
3314375 we do not intend to use the d6 oil in our jamnagar refinery and are close to tying up sales with state refiners
3314376 a joint survey is very much required i told the tamil nadu chief minister that without permission it tamil nadu cannot start the project
3314377 no cumplen con las m nimas garant as ni condiciones que deber an tener en cuanto a n mero de plazas instalaciones y personal
3314378 hasta qu punto las autoridades georgianas hab an coordinado sus acciones con sus socios extranjeros
3314379 todo el mundo conoce su comportamiento con la poblaci n civil en serbia iraq y afganist n
3314380 no hay dudas de que debemos tener el objetivo de limitar los cambios en la temperatura superficial media global de 2 c por encima del nivel preindustrial
3314381 pero dado que ste es un objetivo ambicioso y no sabemos en detalles como limitar las emisiones de gases invernadero para conseguir el objetivo de los dos grados deber amos estar preparados para adaptarnos a 4 c

3314384 no hay elecci n entre adaptaci n y mitigaci n tenemos que hacer las dos
3314385 a 4 c estamos b sicamente en un r gimen clim tico diferentes

3314401 an irish person via a mobile phone and they happened to be in an official olympic car we cannot play that interview outside of ireland

3314438 corporate bond yields could rise up to 75 basis points because inflation will not taper off so easily

3314453 sin duda tenemos un centro del campo muy preparado y de mucho nivel con jugadores como senna eguren josico o bruno que tiene mucha calidad tanto para el trabajo defensivo como en el creativo por eso creo que el mister tiene opciones para hacer la mejor pareja posible para afrontar cualquier partido

3314457 con marcos a n no he jugado pero creo que ambos tenemos caracter sticas parecidas nuestra primera opci n es la de defender y despu s ayudar al equipo para el ataque
3314458 el sevilla esta jugando muchos torneos y ser un rival dif cil

3314465 la competencia es dura y buena va a estar lindo este a o luchar por un puesto en el equipo y lo va a estar en todas las l neas ya que hay jugadores de nivel en todas las demarcaciones y es algo bueno para el equipo y para lo que busca la instituci n

3314476 pero no me quiero comparar con nadie espa a est trabajando fuerte y con mucha tecnolog a estamos en una situaci n mucho mejor de la que est bamos antes
3314477 ser la m xima sanci n posible acompa ada de una investigaci n dirigida a descubrir qui n ha dado esa sustancia a la ciclista
3314478 el cerco se estrecha y para el entorno no es que se estreche es que quiero que acabe en la c rcel o inhabilitado no vamos a bajar la guardia el que la hace la paga y la va a pagar
3314479 al lado del secretario de estado por c mo est trabajando contra el dopaje
3314480 hoy es un momento duro pero no es para echarnos a llorar estamos persiguiendo el dopaje como pocos pa ses en el mundo
3314481 si se han hecho seis controles en el ltimo mes lo que no se puede hacer es perseguir hasta su casa a los corredores para ver qu se toman o qu se inyectan
3314482 defiendo al deporte espa ol y a la federaci n espa ola de ciclismo no vamos a conseguir que nunca haya dopaje pero lucharemos las 24 horas contra l

3314489 siempre son las m ximas a pesar de que la situaci n del club es complicada
3314490 ste es un proyecto que me ha ilusionado mucho me contagi el compromiso y la ilusi n del entrenador y voy a darlo todo
3314491 tenga problemas para encajar todas las piezas nuevas pero creo que no va a haber problemas para comenzar la liga al mismo nivel que los dem s equipos
3314492 jane austen lucretius voltaire because they are great that is no answer their greatness is what we feel after we have read them often years after i have tried to give a more concrete less lofty answer to a natural and proper question
3314493 if you try a book say hobbes leviathan and find it too difficult put it aside for a year or so then take it up again you will find that the other books you have read in the meantime will somehow have made hobbes a little easier that is one of the miracles of this kind of reading each original communication helps us to extract a bit more from all the others
3314494 reading is not a passive experience except when youre reading trash or the news it should be and is one of the most vigorous modes of living a good book like a healthy exercise can give you that pleasant sense of fatigue that comes of having stretched your mental muscles

3314592 de slachtoffers van hiv en aids worden trouwens evenzeer gestigmatiseerd en verstoten als de lepralijders
3314593 het grote knelpunt blijft dat de kerk een aandeel heeft in de omvang van het probleem
3314594 mensen die een condoom gebruiken worden verketterd naar ons gevoel ontloopt de kerk op dit terrein haar maatschappelijke verantwoordelijkheid
3314595 de groep vindt dan ook dat er nog een bijsturing moet gebeuren
3314596 het gaat allemaal de goede richting uit maar het voornaamste probleem is dat het personeel wegens eerdere niet ingeloste beloftes geen vertrouwen meer heeft in de directie
3314597 wellicht naar schiphol en dan richting mexico hopelijk toch want het blijft gissen

3314639 the uk economy continues to slow and the outlook for the rest of 2008 remains gloomy meaning tougher conditions in the labour market given this backdrop it is not surprising that online recruitment is now moderating with fewer job offerings than a year ago in areas such as finance retail and technology
3314640 still it should be noted that advertised vacancies remain well above last summers levels and that demand in the education healthcare and tourism sectors and overall in northern ireland remains elevated
3314641 we know that many people need last minute chinese visas and were able to help meet that need normally travelers to china need to gather all their paperwork together and travel to the chinese embassy or consulate in person instead they can now send the necessary paperwork to us and we take care of everything we know that traveling overseas can be stressful enough and we hope our service alleviates some of our customers stress

3314658 we said back in october that we would abolish stamp duty for nine out of 10 first time buyers this was a fully costed tax cut last october so i do not know why the government is still dithering and not getting on with it
3314659 when it comes to the crisis in our housing market they seem intent on making things worse rather than better
3314660 their decision to brief out the possibility of a stamp duty holiday was completely reckless
3314661 it is not right that we charge our police with combating crime and disorder and then tie their hands behind their backs in the name of whitehall bureaucracy
3314662 revising the acts framework so that authorisation and all the paperwork that goes with it is not required for basic police work is just one way the party will cut red tape to free more police onto our streets
3314663 the election is up to the members of the public to vote and you cant make any presumptions about the way theyre going to vote
3314664 if you look at what the conservative party is doing there is no complacency we are setting out our policies working very hard campaigning all the way through the summer
3314665 weve got a long way to go to convince people that were ready
3314666 there is a really hard programme of work for the conservative party to go through to turn what is a good polling position into an election victory

3314669 weve got this problem where were losing so many referees each season so we needed to show what a football match would be like without a referee
3314670 we got these great ex players and celebrities together to play a pretend match without a referee and it completely descends into chaos
3314671 im one of the players this time in a game that has no referee and the intention is to highlight the important role a referee plays in a football match and the consequences of not having one
3314672 hopefully itll send out a serious message when people are thinking of offering abuse to a referee they should consider the consequences of that particular ref packing in and there not being enough to cover the games that weve got
3314673 its been every schoolboys dream ive met les ferdinand gary mabbutt dave beasant legends of the game but also i met fabio capello who plays an important part in the film
3314674 its great to be involved in something that can encourage people to don the black kit get out there and take charge its just to prove in a light hearted way that no matter what you think of the referee we need them out there and we need an authority figure
3314675 its time that we draw a line under whats happened over the years both in amateur football and in the professional game and stop giving the refs abuse
3314676 it is important that the fa shares its expertise with other national federations which is why the fa is happy to respond to the chilean football federations request for an administration workshop

3314678 it is a great privilege to be invited to chile and i am sure nigel and john will provide a valuable insight into how grassroots football is structured in england

3314682 its one reason why human beings experiencing true relationship is so dificult for you once you have hierarchy you need rules to protect and administer it and then you need law and he enforcment of rules you rarely experience relationship apart from power hierarchy imposes laws and rules and you end up missing the wonder of relationship that we god intended for you
3314683 this is my home i chose to immigrate to the usa this is now my country

3314693 we believe one reason for our impressive growth is that we have inspired our members to think beyond just fitness and wellness and more in terms of a personal and fun approach to their health something we like to call being healthalicious
3314694 beyou tv lets me try some workouts that i would be too shy to do in front of a class full of strangers i also travel a lot so accessing beyou tv from my hotel room is like taking all of my favorite instructors on the road with me my beyou tv membership is my fulfillment of a no more excuses promise i made with myself
3314695 beyou tv is for anyone who wants more than a good workout on the for anyone looking to improve their overall health and well being

3314739 it is a generally accepted principle of international law that in the relations between powers who are contracting parties to a treaty the provisions of municipal law cannot prevail over those of the treaty
3314740 it should be observed that a state cannot adduce as against another state its own constitution with a view to evading obligations incumbent upon it under international law or treaties in force applying these principles to the present case it results that the question of the treatment of polish nationals or other persons of polish origin or speech must be settled exclusively on the basis of the rules of international law and the treaty provisions in force between poland and danzig
3314741 it is hard to imagine that anyone who loves nigeria will insist that we go ahead to implement the green tree agreement as it is in spite of the dangerous security implication which our military have pointed out
3314742 during the senate public hearings on bakassi our military revealed that they were not involved in negotiations which culminated in the signing of this agreement
3314743 so the eastern naval command based in calabar may as well be closed down leaving the entire eastern flank of the country unprotected this can have grave consequences for nigeria in case of external aggression the seriousness of this situation may not dawn on some nigerians who may think of calabar as a remote outpost far away from where they live but the truth is that anything happening to calabar will extract a heavy price from the rest of the country

3314763 it is critical that the more resources we are requesting for go directly to the poorest families affected by hiv and aids not via the many intermediaries that currently stand between various forms of aid and the children who need it
3314764 by targeting only individuals many hiv interventions and services are missing critical opportunities to reach out to family and community members as well

3314793 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses she said
3314794 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3314795 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3314796 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election ms bishop said
3314797 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here

3314806 this is the big dream for everyone concerned it is seeing a dream come true
3314807 its important to enjoy the experience and to feel like a professional team during the two knockout games
3314808 we played well against a professional team although in the second half they began to dominate their goals came from clearances we didnt have a lot of luck
3314809 you always have high hopes more so the players than the staff but we now know what this experience is
3314810 despite everything we never go into these games with fear and we always go out there to win

3314824 the largest upward pressure in july came from food and non alcoholic beverages where prices rose this year but fell a year ago
3314825 within this division there were large upward effects from meat bread and cereals and vegetables

3314835 certainly there will be a slightly higher risk premium to russia because the market normally remember such higher volatility periods for quite a while but if the immediate political and military risk is gone there could also be a recovery in equities reuters
3314836 its very positive news for the rouble because the georgian crisis was the only argument for the rouble weakness we saw in the last couple of days with the crisis seemingly gone the rouble should recover from the losses it suffered
3314837 certainly there will be a slightly higher risk premium to
3314838 if this news that military operations are stopping is correct then that it what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace
3314839 this is a beautiful place with a wonderful people they dont deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations
3314840 we have to wait and see if this is implemented
3314841 russia militarily and politically achieved what it wanted in all that time apart from some verbal criticism it has not met any sharp or fundamental reaction from the united states nor europe
3314842 the eu council of ministers is only meeting tomorrow and it was russias interest to put them in front of a final state of affairs which they seem to have achieved
3314843 it would be tactically disadvantageous for russia to continue in its actions during that meeting given that they had achieved what they wanted
3314844 the attacks on the territory of georgia and the military action outside the areas of conflict discredited russia and i cannot see how russia wants to defend the role of an arbiter a neutral player in those conflicts
3314845 eu ministers should agree on changing the negotiating formats for the conflicts in ossetia and abkhazia the role of russia can no longer be that of an arbiter of these conflicts
3314846 well see a bounce in stocks we saw the currency bounce back this morning

3314848 last month we had putin making some fairly ominous warning sounds on oao metal a mining conglomerate and hinting at the fact that they may have some tax irregularities ominous overtones that are reminiscent of what happened with yukos

3314875 for many years all the stores in our chain have stocked a wide variety of bot h domestic and imported cheeses last year however the five best selling che eses at our newest store were all domestic cheddar cheeses from wisconsin fur thermore a recent survey by cheeses of the world magazine indicates an increa sing preference for domestic cheeses among its subscribers since our company can reduce expenses by limiting inventory the best way to improve profits in all of our stores is to discontinue stocking many of our varieties of imported cheese and concentrate primarily on domestic cheeses
3314876 technologies not only influence but actually determine social customs and ethics
3314877 in the past the body styles of patriot cars have been old fashioned and our cars have not sold as well as have our competitors cars but now since many regions in this country report rapid increases in the numbers of newly licensed drivers we should be able to increase our share of the market by selling cars to this growing population thus we should discontinue our oldest models and concentrate instead on manufacturing sporty cars we can also improve the success of our marketing campaigns by switching our advertising to the youth advertising agency which has successfully promoted the countrys leading soft drink

3314889 warning sausage dog on premises long short legged and according to american researchers fierce the
3314890 welcome to day 4 of our 6 day course the day you get your dog to stop pulling on the lead ive had so many questions sent in to me about this problem which seems
3314891 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3314892 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3314893 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3314894 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3314895 due to a safety issue and high defect rate we are issuing a product recall to anyone who has purchased a psp chotto shot camera after july 1st 2008 even though these units have been tested we have been getting reports that some of these units have been running extremely hot and have emitted a burning smell from the unit an already dangerous and unfortunate situation this could lead to the even more serious event of a fire starting from the unit
3314896 traditional revenue sources will not be sufficient to fund games development if you look at the very narrow definition of the gaming market people are saying the software business will be down 20 per cent by 2011 versus this year
3314897 something is going to have to be there to make up the difference and take us beyond that threshold
3314898 my guess and analysis shows that less than 3 out of 10 games recover their development and marketing costs with boxed goods sales
3314899 so whats going to have to happen creative use of hybrid online and offline advertising revenues online offline transactions with consumers these business models must be explored
3314900 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3314908 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3314909 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3314910 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3314911 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3314912 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi

3314916 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3314917 russian and georgian forces must immediately cease hostilities throughout georgia and return to their aug 6 positions

3314921 i was holding jude and he walked right in front of us
3314922 i took two steps forward and shook his hand he went to jude grabbed his hand and started talking to him after we told him his name he said i got something for him
3314923 jude was smiling at him i told my wife to get the camera out and he stopped he said please no pictures but then he started playing some more
3314924 now it doesnt matter if jude gets teased the man himself played the harmonica for him
3314925 jo and siennas dad ed had a few concerns as any parents would but sienna convinced jo she is happy so shes happy for her daughter
3314926 they talk on the phone all the time and when sienna flew out to malibu to be with balt while he was filming brothers amp sisters she suggested they all meet up
3314927 sienna knew they would get on really well balt is a lovely guy
3314928 sienna proved she was serious about balt and in return he wanted to show her he felt the same
3314929 he thinks its a bit soon for sienna to meet his sons that is something that will come with time but he is obviously secure enough in their relationship to want to show off his new love to his pals
3314930 though sienna and balt are moving really quickly everyone cant help but notice how happy they are
3314931 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3314934 he really likes bradley and youd think that would make him back down but he doesnt hes very selfish
3314935 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3314936 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3314937 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3314938 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

3314944 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3314945 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3314946 we made the written report the fiscal realignment was not necessary and the transfer of funds was not necessary either so we complied the governors in full compliance i feel
3314947 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3314948 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3314949 there is evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3314950 inconsistent with the assurances that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo
3314951 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world
3314952 we the leaders of once captive nations of eastern europe and now eu and nato members estonia latvia lithuania and poland express a deep concern over the russian federations actions toward georgia
3314953 understanding the difference between a habit and an addiction is the first important step to successful quitting by truly understanding the problem smokers can develop an effective quit plan
3314954 preparation is a critical stage of the quitting process it ensures smokers are aware of the symptoms they will face and allows them time to assemble the support they will need from informing family and friends to consulting their doctor and selecting the appropriate cessation aid from the options available
3314955 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
3314956 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet

3314975 not really i could see spending my whole career here
3314976 the whole idea was to make it a spot for us we wanted to make it our own space to hang out
3314977 heath was very very into it he drew the floor plans and thought of the name brightside because its on the bright side of mccarren park
3314978 heath specifically talked about having a place for him and his family to sit
3314979 it was great working with heath he was the most unassuming guy
3314980 i was very fortunate to play as long as i did this game has given me so much
3314981 being offered a position really took me off guard and got me thinking about the possibility of not playing any more
3314982 i just didnt want to go through the grind again
3314983 i was a huge routine guy and it took a tool both mentally and physically
3314984 but i have not one regret i was able to look myself in the mirror every day and know i was prepared to go out there and do what i needed to do in order to help the team win
3314985 i took the inquiries as a positive and moved on to the other side of the ball
3314986 as a bench guy youre almost acting like a manager am i going to pinch hit here or go in as a defensive replacement
3314987 you play the game through in your mind you sit back observe and learn
3314988 the best part is dealing with 25 different personalities and what makes them tick
3314989 i was away from the club for three days when i came back everyone was coming up and saying it was great to see you that meant a lot and was rewarding in itself
3314990 you dont teach hitting style you teach the individual thats what makes the job fun because everyone is different
3314991 you want to know what makes each guy tick and what the keys he needs to get locked in
3314992 it could be a conversation a kick in the butt or an arm around the shoulder
3314993 i probably lose more sleep at night thinking about these guys then when i played
3314994 i didnt know what was going on my mind went blank
3314995 i didnt know what was going on my mind went bland
3314996 i couldnt get focused during the final as i did in the qualification
3314997 this time was much harder than athens my craving for the gold was much more than last time
3314998 i was the defending champion i fought hard with myself to get rid of the thoughts but it was really hard
3314999 since you gave me this chance i would never let you down
3315000 i will stow this one and prepare myself for the next
3315001 i never remind him of practice in fact nothing could stop him
3315002 he said he just didnt want to let down his teammates and me
3315003 my coach dedicated so much for me and my teammates had great hopes in me i was not competing alone
3315004 after four years of endeavor this the silver medal is not the result that i wanted although i crowned in 2004 what i really wanted was a gold medal on our own soil
3315005 boy dont cry youre our hero it is not your gold medal but your spirit and your persistence that we cherish i hope to see your smile again
3315006 believe us we know how much you paid out we will support you as always we support each athlete who fights for his own dream
3315007 actually you did quite well under such a pressure you can grab the silver it was not easy
3315008 zhu is one of the best athletes in the world and you are one of the best coaches
3315009 im going to postpone the case until next week im not a machine
3315010 during the last week of july 19 percent of the more than 300 consultations carried out were for stress related conditions
3315011 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

3315015 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

3315018 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3315019 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3315020 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3315021 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3315022 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3315023 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3315024 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3315025 who are open to doing something on the production side
3315026 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3315027 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3315028 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3315029 amazing amazing amazing so accurate like you know the couple strongly recommend

3315033 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3315034 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3315035 im racing unless my leg breaks down the aim has always been to start the race
3315036 everyday i go out and plan to start the race
3315037 the whole thing has been a race against time and a nightmare from when it was diagnosed
3315038 im getting more and more confident because every day you run more on it and it gets stronger
3315039 i feel good i feel happier even to be at this stage its impossible to judge shape
3315040 a rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3315041 the largest upward pressure in july came from food and non alcoholic beverages where prices rose this year but fell a year ago
3315042 within this division there were large upward effects from meat bread and cereals and vegetables
3315043 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3315044 the rise in to a series high of 4 4 percent in july was well above expectations
3315045 said himself he thinks that it isnt necessarily the right moment given the for a meeting with the president
3315046 our country must surely be occupied by chinese troops because we are so afraid of displeasing china
3315047 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3315048 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3315049 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3315050 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3315051 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3315052 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective
3315053 these candidates bring specific and relevant experience to ubs namely in global financial services the fields of change management and regulation and the perspectives of institutional shareholders
3315054 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3315055 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3315056 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3315062 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3315063 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3315064 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3315065 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3315066 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3315067 the attorney general appears to be ignoring both the magistrate and his own prosecutor therefore one has to assume the true motivation behind this action is to build campaign support for the next gubernatorial election and divert attention away from his own personal issues that may stand in the way of his ambitions
3315068 the court was clear that the prohibition extended to witnesses not merely the two victims
3315069 in this case the defendant has demonstrated an inability to adhere to reasonable bond conditions and has had his bond in that case modified several times in response to violations
3315070 we believe that no contact means just that no contact
3315071 the only thing the magistrate said she wanted was to stay away from the two officers
3315072 its only fair for them the prosecutor to look at it but its nothing if it is what we think it is
3315073 we will be talking to the mayor and we expect to resolve this

3315116 bis der notarzt zur stelle ist vergehen wertvolle minuten deshalb m ssen wespen und auch bienengiftallergiker im sommer immer medikamente f r den notfall bei sich tragen
3315117 es soll vom patienten selbst oder von der begleitperson bereits bei den ersten anzeichen einer schweren reaktion wie verengung der kehle oder schwindelanfall schwarzwerden vor den augen als zeichen von blutdruckabfall verabreicht werden erste warnsignale sind juckender nesselausschlag und anschwellen von lippen augen gesicht oder auch der handfl chen sowie in der folge rote augen rinnende nase und oder asthmatische beschwerden belkeit erbrechen schwei ausbruch herzklopfen und in voller auspr gung der allergische schock mit blutdruckabfall und bewusstseinsverlust
3315118 damit das adrenalin in diesem absoluten ausnahmezustand einfach und damit sicher verabreicht werden kann steht es in form eines autoinjektors zur verf gung die bedienung ist denkbar leicht schutzkappe abziehen und den injektor im liegen gegen den u eren oberschenkel dr cken alles weitere funktioniert automatisiert
3315119 diese panne kann zus tzlich zur fingerverletzung auch kritisch enden weil der autoinjektor jetzt nicht mehr f r die behandlung zur verf gung steht und das adrenalin aus dem finger nicht in den kreislauf gelangt wie es erforderlich w re
3315120 die handhabung des autoinjektors l sst sich so leicht erlernen dass er sogar bei kindern ab 6 jahren eine selbstapplikation erm glicht wichtig ist dass der behandelnde arzt den patienten regelm ig in der anwendung mit einem geeigneten trainingsger t schult damit auch in stress situationen jeder handgriff sitzt
3315121 auch die haltbarkeit von arzneimitteln ist begrenzt da die wirkung seitens des herstellers aber nur bis zum ablaufdatum gew hrleistet werden kann muss man sich rechtzeitig vor dem sommer um ein neues rezept k mmern
3315122 die spezifische immuntherapie stellt die einzige m glichkeit dar eine bienen und wespengiftallergie urs chlich und mit nachhaltigem erfolg zu behandeln sie bietet einen ber 95 99 igen schutz vor dem lebensgef hrlichen kreislaufversagen au erdem erh ht sie nachgewiesenerma en die lebensqualit t der betroffenen

3315125 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3315126 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3315127 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3315128 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3315129 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3315130 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3315131 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3315132 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3315133 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3315134 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3315135 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3315136 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3315137 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3315138 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3315139 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3315140 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3315141 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3315142 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3315143 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3315144 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3315145 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3315146 some very serious questions to answer on his return to australia
3315147 mr rudd must tell west australians whether the 134 000 job losses will occur in this state and if so where and in which parts of the economy and in which businesses she said
3315148 he has to answer why there was a 2 billion tax hike on gas condensate a 2 billion tax hike on the north west shelf which we believe will be passed onto domestic gas users in this state
3315149 and he must also answer why he has done nothing to reduce grocery or oil prices as he promised to do at the last election
3315150 mr rudd does have history of a relationship with brian burke that he tried to avoid in the lead up to the federal election ms bishop said
3315151 all those issues of his dealings with brian burke and how honest he was with the australian people about his relations with brian burke will be the focus of his visit here
3315152 weve already had five ministers resign since the last election how many more would be resigning if wed heard from the ccc on this governments shady dealings ms bishop said
3315153 he probably just has to show up to make history or at most dive in
3315154 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3315155 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3315156 understanding whats beneath your feet is pretty important if you need to know about energy or mineral resources
3315157 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3315158 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3315159 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3315160 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3315161 it is the type of olympic coverage that couch potatoes have trained for for their entire lives
3315162 in the short term it is business as usual we dont rely on dr thaksins money
3315163 when mark hughes makes a decision we go through the normal process which can include banks finance or a whole bunch of different things just like any other club
3315164 he is willing to look at whatever it takes to make city a great football club
3315165 i gave him an update on the club and we talked about new player acquisitions
3315166 we also talked over dinner about why he had bought the club and his intentions
3315167 it was really clear he wants to be at this football club for the next 10 years
3315168 textaloud quickly became a very important part of my learning process
3315169 then when reading text on a web page or in an e mail whenever i needed to check on how to pronounce the words i simply played them with textaloud
3315170 i could do this easily from within outlook firefox and internet explorer using the textaloud toolbars or from other applications using the clipboard monitoring feature
3315171 i installed an electronic dictionary which meant i was able to select an unknown word or phrase for a translation if needed
3315172 but the end result is that textaloud now speaks an english word to me using an english voice then repeats the word twice in german using the klaus german voice this process allows me enough time to repeat the word out loud and then finishes by repeating a phrase also incorporating the target word
3315173 textaloud is great for learning the proper pronunciations of foreign words no matter what the language
3315174 in addition since textaloud works with all standard text files all of the steps needed to create word repetitions and other exercises can be automated
3315175 these are invaluable for quickly and efficiently creating a custom language lesson
3315176 i love the fact that textaloud dutifully creates audio files for all my german language words and phrases which i can then sync with itunes into my treo and use whenever i have the time and inclination and wherever i go
3315177 ive also created audio books in english for long car trips with the family
3315178 the beauty of textaloud is that it is easy to use for the beginner and powerful for the advanced user
3315179 it has simplified every step of my language learning life i am no longer tied to the computer nor do i need to sit down with a book i can learn on a walk on a bus plane train anywhere
3315180 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3315181 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3315182 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3315183 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3315184 though some reports say the music isnt great the feedback ive got from the company that released the audio is very positive
3315185 satyam is a film with a social message i wanted it to be a commercial film because i faltered before when i did sivapathikaaram my first film with a social message the song chellame chellame was incorporated after much deliberation we ensured it blended with the script and didnt stick out we also wanted to show the chemistry between the two characters
3315186 the songs a little too steamy and the next thing we knew people were linking me with nayan a month before that reports suggested i was seeing priyamani im yet to fall in love and when i do ill announce it proudly he says but his announcement will end at telling people hes seeing someone
3315187 i dont have to give anyone details about my personal life and the public should respect my privacy
3315188 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3315189 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3315190 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3315191 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3315192 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3315193 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3315194 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3315195 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3315196 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3315197 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3315198 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3315199 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3315200 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3315201 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3315202 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3315203 we are concerned that there is a great deal of external inspiration and support we are also concerned and are looking at a mastermind within the country
3315204 clearly there is some kind of organisation we have to find out if that organisation is localised or there is an external group or module operating
3315205 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3315206 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3315207 too many of these small coastal cetaceans end up as bycatch in fisheries this remains the main threat to them and it is only going to get worse
3315208 river dolphins are one of the most threatened cetacean categories mainly because they are locked in competition with humans for dwindling freshwater resources
3315209 disentanglement programmes to release whales captured in fishing gear already carried out in the united states new zealand and australia help some individuals survive
3315210 however areas of critical habitat need to be closed to certain types of fishing at least seasonally to ensure the survival of some species
3315211 large parts of the oceans are now filled with human generated noise not only from military sonar but also from seismic surveys and shipping this noise undoubtedly affects many cetaceans in some cases leading to their death
3315212 it may not always kill whales and dolphins but it affects their ability to communicate and it can drive them away at least temporarily from their feeding grounds
3315213 to save whales for future generations we need to work closely with the fishing industry the military and offshore enterprises including shippers and oil developers and we need to fight climate change

3315239 it can be our menu changes almost every day were very flexible in what we work with but were very limited too for example we have a limited portion of each item because there are only two strip loins in a cow that equates to 30 portions of new york strip loin and once it runs out thats it it goes along with the idea of sustainability
3315240 exactly so for example yesterdays first course was a salad of flowers and sprouts just being the time of year that it is nothings available theres asparagus which is finishing and radishes which are done now whats happening is plants are flowering to produce the fruits of summer but at the moment whats available is sprouts and flowers and lots of bees

3315243 despite the snps spin the pig industry will be bitterly disappointed by the half hearted and half baked measures announced by the government today
3315244 nearly a quarter of the funding announced today is not new money just recycled pledges from the snp contrary to the key recommendations of richard lochheads own scottish pig sector task force there is also no money for pig producers
3315245 this was an opportunity for the government to take serious action to support scotlands beleaguered pig industry but it has turned out to be yet another slap in the face for scottish pig farmers
3315246 the snp is letting down scotlands farmers at the time they most need support

3315248 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3315249 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3315250 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3315251 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3315252 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3315253 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3315254 its a premature move i cannot see us accepting this french draft
3315255 it is a very grim situation and a dangerous one this russian invasion recalls variously the invasion of afghanistan 1978 the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and soviet invasion of georgia in 1922
3315256 no matter how this conflict started russia has escalated it well beyond the dispute over south ossetia and invaded another country
3315257 the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3315258 must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the us and europe

3315263 ministers have once again failed to meet their own targets af
3315264 despite the health secretary agreeing to accept the recommendations of the review group there is still a pressing need for an independent public enquiry into what happened at the vale of leven hospital given the severe criticism of nhs greater glasgow and clyde contained within the report
3315265 there are other hospitals ran by nhs greater glasgow and clyde such as the inverclyde royal hospital which have been treated in the same way as the vale of leven how can the patients in these hospitals have confidence that they are not being left at risk from hospital acquired infections
3315266 ministers have once again failed to meet their own targets af
3315267 the environment committees plans must be put on ice until they are in possession of all the facts
3315268 before any decisions are taken the european parliament must undertake a full economic and environmental impact study across europe this study must evaluate the potential damage that their proposals are likely to have on eu food production
3315269 to push this ill thought out piece of legislation through without checking for any negative impact on food production would be an act of arrogant folly especially when rapidly rising food bills are hitting consumers

3315271 this was a peaceful protest held to highlight chinas treatment of tibet
3315272 the chinese government should not be using heavy handed and repressive tactics to deal with such protests

3315275 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang
3315276 one is the sophisticated coordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3315277 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful
3315278 but behind it all the situation is different people are really angry

3315373 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
3315374 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
3315375 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

3315384 misguided and untrue view on sexuality where a woman with a dildo is seen as liberated strong and independent whereas a man with a blow up plastic vagina is viewed as disgusting and perverted

3315386 the right of lebanon its people its army and its resistance to liberate its land
3315387 raising the question of the resistances arms is no longer justified
3315388 our national duty dictates the continuation of the resistance and the prevention of any attempt to weaken it
3315389 were aiming to emulate the spirit and excitement of the olympic games with this promotion
3315390 here anyone from many nations is welcome to participate and compete for the glory of victory everyone has a chance of winning a medal plus the opportunity to win one of our great cash prizes
3315391 i thought that at the end of the day quality would win
3315392 we would like to think that if something is made well it ought to be able to pay for itself
3315393 you have a 99 percent chance of being a failure if you are an independent film
3315394 all of a sudden all these beekeeping societies started contacting us wanting buy videos and book screenings
3315395 i realized that if beekeepers are a community there are an infinite number of communities any number of films can be marketed to

3315403 non so come si fa a non dirle queste cose
3315404 perch non viene rispettato il dolore delle persone colpite da una tragedia
3315405 faccio il mio lavoro egoisticamente fregandomene di tutti i valori che mi sono stati insegnati o cerco di mantenere una certa etica ma perdo opportunit di successo lucrativo considerevoli
3315406 nel formulare giudizi gli antichi re erano perfetti perch facevano dei principi morali il punto di partenza di tutti i loro impegni e la radice di ogni cosa che era utile questo principio per qualcosa che le persone di intelletto mediocre non afferrano mai non afferrandolo mancano di consapevolezza e mancando di consapevolezza inseguono il profitto ma mentre inseguono il profitto assolutamente impossibile per loro essere certi di raggiungerlo
3315407 la mente delluomo superiore ha familiarit con la giustizia la mente delluomo mediocre ha familiarit con il guadagno
3315408 la gestione fare le cose nel modo giusto la leadership fare le cose giuste
3315409 i dirigenti dovranno investire sempre di pi su questioni come la cultura i valori lethos e i beni immateriali piuttosto che manager hanno bisogno di essere cultori e narratori per catturare le menti
3315410 cerca di diventare non un uomo di successo ma piuttosto un uomo di valore
3315411 credo che la maggior parte delle miserie del genere umano siano causate da valutazioni sbagliate che esso ha fatto del valore delle cose
3315412 la terra fornisce abbastanza per soddisfare i bisogni di ogni uomo ma non lavidit di ogni uomo
3315413 senza valori e obblighi morali comunemente condivisi e ampiamente radicati n la legge n il governo democratico nemmeno leconomia di mercato funzioneranno correttamente
3315414 sebbene la polvere doro sia preziosa quando ti entra negli occhi ti ostacola la vista
3315415 la mia proposta per unetica che sostituisca lidea del principio di massimizzare il valore per gli azionisti sarebbe di costruire e condividere la ricchezza perch il concetto di valore per gli azionisti sempre stato di creare la ricchezza la terminologia stata di intralcio comunque proprio la parola valore implica unimmediatezza che in molti casi non dovrebbe trovare posto nella gestione di grandi aziende
3315416 il capitalismo la sbalorditiva convinzione che il pi malvagio degli uomini far la pi malvagia delle azioni per il massimo bene di tutti
3315417 se vogliamo andare avanti dobbiamo tornare indietro e riscoprire quei preziosi valori che tutta la realt imperniata su basi morali e che tutta la realt ha un controllo spirituale
3315418 legoismo parla tutte le lingue e recita tutti i ruoli anche quello della generosit
3315419 la dichiarazione dei profitti di una azienda pu essere paragonata a un bikini ci che rivela interessante ma ci che nasconde fondamentale
3315420 quale vantaggio avr un uomo se guadagna il mondo intero e perde la sua anima o cosa dar un uomo in cambio della sua anima
3315421 il principale valore del denaro sta nel fatto che viviamo in un mondo in cui sopravvalutato
3315422 il valore della vita non nella lunghezza dei giorni ma nelluso che ne facciamo un uomo pu vivere a lungo ma vivere molto poco
3315423 quanta verit pu sopportare uno spirito quanta verit pu affrontare uno spirito questo diventato per me sempre pi la vera misura del valore
3315424 gli uomini non apprezzano una buon azione se non porta una ricompensa

3315433 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
3315434 going over there has definitely helped my riding you learn to become very consistent
3315435 im not sure if i was lacking consistency or if it was the rides i was getting midweek but people were saying i was just a carnival jockey
3315436 over there it didnt matter whether you were on a 100 1 horse or an odds on thing your rides were heavily scrutinised by everyone and that makes you perform better
3315437 im not perturbed by the depth in the riding ranks i think its great for sydney racing and its a challenge im looking forward to
3315438 im not overly concerned with whos back and whos doing what i want to concentrate on my own backyard
3315439 at the end of the day my riding will do more than any interviews or talking will do and i back myself to perform well on the track
3315440 from all reports northern meteor goes all right and you know that john will have the horse ready to go
3315441 im looking forward to getting back on him i saw him at trackwork this morning and he looks great
3315442 we will work him in the morning and see how he is then
3315443 les beer will ride him and he will tell me how he feels and if there is any sore spots he wont run
3315444 a lot came out of it this morning and more this afternoon so we hope it will be cleaned out by tomorrow
3315445 he is pretty good this afternoon and hopefully the worst is over now
3315446 he is improving and he is a helluva lot better today but we cant take any risks with because he is too good a horse
3315447 we are delighted to be welcoming the holy grail of racing the emirates melbourne cup trophy to south gippsland as part of its annual tour the day is sure to be memorable and benefit the entire community
3315448 the emirates melbourne cup tour is now an integral component in the lead up to the highly anticipated melbourne cup carnival and has been widely embraced by communities throughout the country
3315449 this year the vrc received a record number of 53 tenders of which were all of an exceptionally high standard and we are proud to announce that stony creek will be one of the 26 official tour destinations
3315450 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace medvedev said at a televised meeting
3315451 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored he said at the meeting with defence minister anatoly serdyukov and the head of the militarys general staff nikolai makarov
3315452 the aggressor has been punished and suffered significant losses he said
3315453 if we have received the order to cease fire this does not mean that we have stopped all actions including reconnaissance general anatoly nogovitsyn said at a briefing

3315457 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3315458 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3315459 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3315460 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3315461 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3315462 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective
3315463 these candidates bring specific and relevant experience to ubs namely in global financial services the fields of change management and regulation and the perspectives of institutional shareholders
3315464 it is our firm resolve that we will root out terrorism from pakistan and all of our security agencies are working together to achieve this goal
3315465 our operations in northern ireland have gone very well in the past two years we are examining the possibility of entering the market in southern ireland but it is still being reviewed it is a very competitive market but we think we have a lot offer the customer there
3315466 through this time of tragedy they will save each other as they have done so bravely in the past
3315467 brigid and her children must once again find courage in the face of adversity to deal with their sadness
3315468 the sheer numbers of people and priests who have called to the family home over the weekend have shown that the rooney family are part and parcel of a very rich community of forthill
3315469 perhaps it helps us to avoid the hard work that comes with self reflection
3315470 in life we rarely encounter those who move beyond judging towards understanding and compassion simply because they choose to do so grief is never an easy burden to bear and especially when it comes in an untimely fashion
3315471 the rooney family sadly has experienced this hurt and pain previously but once again their love and their faith will sustain them
3315472 joe was a great hearted young fellow and enjoyed supporting glenview stars and sligo rovers he was also interested in art and was completely devoted to his partner and little daughter
3315473 it is a big blow to his mother brigid who was due to celebrate her 70th birthday at the weekend
3315474 we are all just devastated for the rooneys who are a very quiet decent and hard working family
3315475 this is exactly the sort of show that you hope to find at the fringe its got the acting and writing that will have you laughing out loud and nearly crying
3315476 i am delighted it was never on my to do list but i had a great day id do it again for the craic
3315477 the dress and shoes are from enchanted vintage clothes shop in rathcormac the wrap is borrowed from a friend the hat was made by amy ohara from ballintogher it is made from reclaimed material from dunmoran strand
3315478 i have won it twice before but ive not been here for five years i was planning the outfit for a while you have an idea in your head but whether it comes together is another matter
3315479 the dress is from harvey nicholls in dublin the hat is from wendy louise in longford the shoes are from faith in sligo and the umbrella is from mullaneys in sligo
3315480 the competition has got so much bigger there was never the champagne and marquee before
3315481 i had the hat for years it was just plain black and cream we sprayed it cream and got fixative from homebase and stuck on brooches earrings beads hair clips lace from a top parts of a necklace and a scarf the wire is from woodies
3315482 i cant believe it i am in shock ive had an absolutely brilliant day i loved mingling with all the ladies and asking about their outfits i love the fashion side of today its a great chance for ladies to express their creativity and get dressed up
3315483 i liked the outfits where the personality came through its great to hear about people making things themselves i love that it shows that you dont have to be loaded to have style
3315484 we were in the district court at 10 30 when the gardai told us shortly afterwards that the case was not going ahead they thought it was going to be adjourned
3315485 but it then went ahead in the evening when we were not present when i enquired the gardai told me that there was a plea at the last minute i know that can happen but surely someone could have told us
3315486 he still has significant scars a year later and there are also medical reports
3315487 why did they not contact us and tell us that the case was going on in the afternoon we might not have been able to address the court but it is very much a part of the justice system
3315488 my son was slashed in the face in a number of areas in this attack he said hello to the other man who just lashed out and hit him a number of times
3315489 i have the photograph to prove it and we also saw the cctv footage it wasnt an accident and his scars clearly show the real extent of the injuries he suffered
3315490 there are at least three different stab marks with the bottle jack spent a night in sligo general hospital
3315491 what kind of a signal does that send out to young people
3315492 the iaaf is sending a clear message that we will not tolerate doping
3315493 oh man what if we were a molecule inside of a galaxy

3315495 comme ils disent dans la pub le calcul est donc simple il ne faut pas transformer notre environnement en poubelle si nous ne d sirons pas y claquer avant l ge dans les remugles toxiques des industries dont celles qui fabriquent les composants de la wii mais assez de mauvais esprit
3315496 that a politician who elicits less and less respect from his public thinks that the public has a problem with respect blair wasnt worried about this in 1998
3315497 when we talk about opening up opportunities which is basically the direction of new labour we dont take account of the people who get left behind
3315498 when government emphasises nurturing talent and focuses on the talented 10th youve got a huge cultural and social problem about the other nine 10ths how are they integrated how you do that at schools
3315499 thats a question of respect as practised by institutions to individuals and if i may say so its a bigger question than the one the government is addressing now
3315500 the police dont need more powers they need a change o f attitude
3315501 i looked up to him at the start i really admired him but i think hes just two faced now
3315502 the policies we have had for the last 40 years clearly have not worked in terms of reducing drug use so i think it does deserve a fresh look the principal objective of this study was to bring a dispassionate approach to what is a very passionate issue
3315503 what we are trying to say is we should review the penalties in the light of the harms and try to have a more proportionate legal response
3315504 the point we are making is that all drugs are dangerous even the ones that people know and love and use regularly like alcohol
3315505 i morally will not sign it because we did not misbehave
3315506 they are asking to be treated differently than any other company
3315507 obviously its a long way away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the
3315508 its an honour to compete in the olympics its been great
3315509 im playing for a medal but i have to get there first that will be the ultimate goal for me

3315511 there were at least four contributing factors to the rochdale case 1 the capacity and willingness of the social workers to discern reality 2 the framework of social work practice which suggested specific actions 3 the broader culture within which these actions can be credible and supported by others particularly the media and 4 the legal system and structures which can uphold the actions of the social worker in the face of absence of evidence and the families persistent claims of innocence ever more thorough checking and conferring among social workers is constantly being legislated for and accepted as an obligation within the profession however stigmatising social work must be avoided distrust from the public and the media is a hugely inhibiting factor in a social workers ability to care properly the deaths from abuse of victoria climbi and other children were partly due to decisions not to interfere in clearly dysfunctional families this points to the need to free social workers from huge caseloads and unreasonable pressures
3315512 politicians are desperate to foster a culture of volunteering because they see it as a way to bring communities closer together and deliver better public services
3315513 but politicians cant engineer the kind of enthusiasm and energy of the best community groups
3315514 young people do want to change their communities but on their own terms groups like envision ask young people what they want to do to improve their communities and then give them the tools to get on and do it they are
3315515 it was a great night and everyone enjoyed the craic and the entertainment for a small community there was a huge turnout and we are really happy with the support
3315516 on behalf of lisa and myself i would like to say a big thank you to everyone who helped to organise the event and the board of management at the northside centre for allowing us to use the centre for the occasion
3315517 each stone that is placed on the summit will signify a cancer patient from the north west
3315518 we are hoping that a big contingent of people will join us in this sponsored walk they will be helping the campaign for the rights of those same patients and their families as well as raising much needed funds for shout sligo hospital oncology unit trust
3315519 this sponsored climb is the first of a series of high profile events to raise awareness of the implications of government and hse plans to scrap cancer services at sligo general hospital
3315520 if they thought we were going to go away they are very much mistaken this is just the first in a series of events that we plan to stage we wont rest until sligo general hospital is confirmed as one of the countrys cancer centres of excellence
3315521 its going to be hectic with long hours but its such a spectacular event and its great to working at such a global event
3315522 we would hope to have the school up and running within the next two years
3315523 i suppose it is a natural progression from the gaelscoil at primary school level which has been in existence since 1996 in ballydoogan
3315524 at present we are looking at sites for a new primary school but a committee has also been set up to try and establish a colaiste gaeilge in the city
3315525 this project is not confined to gaelscoil chnoc na re but is much more all embracing
3315526 it will involve all of those who are interested in having their children educated through the medium of irish at secondary school level
3315527 the first strand is to find out how many of the parents of the children who are going to gaelscoil chnoc na re would wish their children to continue their education through irish
3315528 but we would also be keen to find out from all other primary schools in the region and not just in sligo it is very much about numbers and we would have to convince the department of education in that regard as to its viability
3315529 a secondary school would have a much wider catchment area and that would be include areas like manorhamilton which already has a primary gaelscoil so it is not just confined to the gaelscoil chnco na re area
3315530 a secondary school would also need teachers who were interested and capable of teaching subjects through the medium of irish so this is another aspect that we will be exploring
3315531 it is clear that the west of ireland is suffering a death by a thousand cuts
3315532 fishing along the west coast was under immense pressure from the eu common fisheries policy while farmers are facing a possibly disastrous wto deal if the mandelson proposals are accepted the viability of these sectors is under threat
3315533 two years ago sligo county council passed a motion calling on sligo local authorities and irish rail to investigate the possibility of a car park to the rear of sligo railway station in the area known as the station masters field
3315534 due to the increased number of trains from sligo to dublin daily this car park is a must for passengers using the train who travel to the station using their own cars
3315535 most people in sligo town can walk to the station or get someone to drop them off but a lot of people coming from outside the town have to bring their car with them and can often find it difficult to get parked near the station
3315536 this funding will translate into significant improvements in nonnational roads in clar areas in the county
3315537 the allocation was determined by the percentage population of the total county population in clar areas
3315538 yes show us that you have integrity that you are honest and that you value merit but do not become rigid in the application of these values
3315539 he saw this picture and obviously for him it was very easy recognising the girl accompanied by a woman in a veil
3315540 its her nanny she is a young moroccan woman who is qualified to look after children and works in a care centre
3315541 i am very pleased that this little girl has been identified and that she can be ruled out from her familys perspective
3315542 lets not kid ourselves that this is a glorious sport quite the contrary
3315543 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3315544 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3315545 the bombs hit in front of us and beside us
3315546 several people were wounded and lying in the street we got straight out of there
3315547 russians bombed the btc pipeline south of the city of rustavi
3315548 its a second attempt to bomb this pipeline since august 10
3315549 our goal is to free the kodori gorge of georgian troops
3315550 i was sweating it out at the line in athens i crossed the line yesterday and thought im not going to get this one its such a hard course out there that people started making mistakes and it ended up being my lucky day i think i would swap every medal i have in every other competition for an olympic medal
3315551 i didnt have that little bit of excellence that i had earlier in the season
3315552 i dont have any regrets im going from bronze to silver but im a bit disappointed because i was hoping to get s first gold medal
3315553 when i look in the mirror here i see a good looking kid
3315554 usually thats not always the case so i like to say that suits me its cool to be in the village with the best athletes in the world
3315555 hes a special kid mature beyond his years he has a cool demeanor doesnt get rattled
3315556 we all knew coming in here he would sit up there and say ok you can start the press conference now hes really a good kid
3315557 hes going to line up against pros he just graduated from high school
3315558 we dont need to push him he has his own drive
3315559 ive heard stories olympic stories and non olympic stories that i would say have helped me deal with this pressure of being here ive enjoyed myself the whole time im just excited to be here
3315560 i dont come into this race as a huge favorite which is something i like
3315561 im sort of somewhat of an underdog due to my age and inexperience so im just here for the experience and being a part of the olympic games and being part of the u s team its something thats really incredible and something not many people are able to do
3315562 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
3315563 tropical forest destruction has always been the main cause but now it appears that hunting is just as serious a threat in some areas even where the habitat is still quite intact
3315564 it is quite spectacular we are just wiping out primates
3315565 the problem with these species is that they have long lives so it takes time to reverse the decline it is quite depressing
3315566 this creates access allowing people to go to places that they could not go in the past
3315567 primates are relatively easy to hunt because they are diurnal live in groups and are noisy they are really easy targets
3315568 many of the asian primates like langurs are 5 10kg so they are a good target generally you find that what is big and easy to get disappears very quickly
3315569 if you kill seven 10 or 20 mountain gorillas it has a devastating impact on the entire population
3315570 within the red list criteria you are allowed to anticipate what will happen in the future as well as look at what has happened in the past
3315571 so it was decided not to change the mountain gorillas listing because of the sudden deaths and we do not know when it is going to stop
3315572 militias have been in control of the gorilla sector since september last year which means the congolese wildlife authority has been unable to manage the area and protect the gorillas
3315573 until the war ends and the rangers are able to get back in and patrol the area we have no idea as to the fate of almost a third of the mountain gorillas left in the world
3315574 the lion tamarins were almost extinct in the wild but they were very popular in zoos so there was a large captive population
3315575 so zoos around the world decided to join forces to introduce a captive breeding programme to reintroduce the tamarins in brazil
3315576 they were not exposed to eagles or snakes and they did not know how to find food so a lot of them died but some did survive and slowly the numbers began to increase
3315577 it took time money and effort at all levels from the politicians to scientists and volunteers on the ground for just two species
3315578 investors must show reliance upon a defendants own deceptive conduct plaintiffs evidence falls well short of this standard
3315579 a corporate management can engage in the most disgraceful acts involving third parties but if it didnt put out a press release announcing its chicanery it gets off the hook this ruling is particularly toxic for enron investors who were victims of a wide swath of wrongdoing reaching far beyond the company
3315580 open the possibility that it could try to halt further integration of the two companies or require whole foods to sell some operations
3315581 i dont come into this race as a huge favourite which is something i like
3315582 im sort of an underdog due to my age and my inexperience im just here exactly for the experience and being a part of the olympic games
3315583 i think he feels a lot better now and hes excited to be here im excited for him to be here as well though he appears unusually composed at a news conference phinneys youth shines through when he mentions that he could not get his parents access to training at the velodrome
3315584 over the course of this year theyve been with me the whole time so coming here and have them distanced from me is a little bit hard
3315585 but im 18 and supposed to be a man so ive got to take care of myself
3315586 they have chinese mobiles and i have a chinese mobiles so weve been calling each other
3315587 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3315588 should exist to give our industry a chance of competing with foreign ones
3315589 one of the many benefits of opening an overseas branch is that these days a lot of indian companies are buying companies abroad by opening a branch in another country we can take up their financial requirements there
3315590 trade financing facilitating remittances of the diaspora and financing local industries are the other reasons for setting up a branch abroad

3315593 not so long ago the sahara desert which has already taken away part of our arable land was not dry land but thriving vegetation full of flowing rivers and wild games time has come for us political office holders and other stakeholders to show our utmost resourcefulness and reliability to save our people and guarantee our nations sustainable development
3315594 nigeria should be able to reclaim all the lands affected and turn them to arable lands this is very necessary and timely now that the world is facing serious challenge on food crisis

3315598 its misleading its snake oil salesmanship of the worst order
3315599 maximum capacity from these new leases wouldnt be reached until 2030
3315600 and even then the amount of oil expected to come from these leases would have little or no effect on the price of gasoline at the pump
3315601 assuming that everything over all those years goes all right it is estimated that an additional 200 000 barrels of oil a day would come from the additional offshore drilling thats a tiny share of the worlds daily output of 85 million or so barrels
3315602 heres what the energy information administration the statistical agency that provides official data for the federal government had to say about the anticipated additional output from offshore drilling
3315603 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years
3315604 there is the issue of giving false expectations that theyll be spent in the near term
3315605 you just cant keep spending and borrowing at that rate and expect that taxpayers are going to continue to pay higher taxes
3315606 borrowing so much that hes going to turn around and ask for a very large tax increase
3315607 the bonding is based very much on an affordability analysis
3315608 our capital plan is not a wish list there are some choices that we made
3315609 we can even speed it up if things get really great or slow it down if we hit a wall
3315610 depending on what happens in 2009 it could be a cause for concern
3315611 your revenues are declining and then youre carrying more debt so they need to be careful
3315612 i just went out and ate a sandwich somewhere and felt terrible

3315623 developers are the driving force behind android applications so without them it would be very hard for android to have a stance in the market
3315624 the android platform has a very strong base and a lot of potential but it also has a lot of competition
3315625 the adc finalists are helping us update the latest version of the sdk before we release it to the world in the coming weeks
3315626 we wanted to limit the challenges developers face with an early release in a particularly critical time during the challenge to not disadvantage them weve separated the scheduled releases to not disadvantage these winners who are competing for money and the public will receive a release of the sdk soon with more documentation and tools
3315627 the idea with open source software is to allow early adopters access to the buggier pieces of code so they can help fix them or let people who want to wait for a solid release the ability to do that
3315628 the key is choice and google has taken away that choice and is developing android like every other piece of closed software
3315629 rather than trying to push yet another platform google ought to be bringing the market together and building applications which is where theyre going to make their money
3315630 the developer discontent is just part of what has turned out to be a flawed strategy
3315631 its the very same reason why apple didnt do third party developers first and thats to assure the process and the program and the quality thats initially being offered
3315632 they re pretty sure they can get 50 quality applications
3315633 the community must not forget that google is dealing with partners in the cell phone industry and they certainly have a reputation of a closed source tight lipped mentality
3315634 the community can cry foul if google releases the newest sdk to developers a week before handsets hit the stores but as far as i have heard that is far from the truth
3315635 within the next six months symbian and android will combine into a single open source os
3315636 on the other hand it would be much easier to do now than to tackle it in the future when developers are that much farther down the road
3315637 to tie symbian and android together would require an awful lot of heavy lifting between google and nokia and to do that kind of an agreement would be problematic
3315638 it would have been easier while symbian was small and independent but now that symbian is basically a subsidiary of nokia it s going to be pretty difficult
3315639 if you develop for apple youve got a ready market
3315640 if you develop for android its a crapshoot because theres no assurance that the android platform is even going to sell
3315641 while google does simple well this is googles first device as opposed to apple which clearly has been doing devices for a while
3315642 apple is treating developers terribly and really undermining the community
3315643 the fact that applications have to go through the in order to be distributed really shows how much control apple has over the entire os
3315644 at the end of the day developers want to make money
3315645 so theyre going to develop on a platform and put resources on a platform that will make them money
3315646 undoubtedly some developers have written android off and will never return
3315647 lots arent paying a darn bit of attention to the whole mess because there arent any devices ready yet

3315652 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
3315653 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters
3315654 we have people here from all religions and cultural backgrounds some of whom may feel uncomfortable or offended with condoms in their room
3315655 no one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment

3315658 fumi kondo managing director of nyc based consultancy intellilink solutions once observed an exchange between a software developer and a project manager where the developer told the project manager that he could add extra features to an application with no additional effort

3315665 doctors clearly are not convinced that the new revalidation process will provide the benefits the government is citing
3315666 less than half agree that revalidation will enhance public confidence in the medical profession or ensure physicians keep more up to date
3315667 overall only about half of gps see any good in the revalidation process and even fewer just 28 think it is long overdue
3315668 one of our respondents summed up what seems to be the predominant feeling calling the new process a shallow political gesture with no cost benefit evidence to support it another called it another costly exercise based on an unsound premise that pulls yet more time away from our patients still others spoke about potentially resigning or moving overseas
3315669 well on our way to doubling our capacity to 25 000 patients
3315670 because in all of them we are already leading the way in the uk or europe our goal is to build on that reputation and become genuinely world class in as many of those areas as possible

3315686 this is just one of a series of scenes when me and bella are getting to know each other better
3315687 its when a lot of the secrets between us are being revealed im not sure how much im supposed to say but the key secret has been revealed and im letting her in on more of my lifestyle and the secrets of that
3315688 we sat around my dining room table for like two entire nights with the script
3315689 but there were two nights that we were actually like productive
3315690 these are beautiful super sexy vampires but theyre strong enough and powerful enough that they can kill you anyway
3315691 im dressed in baseball gear because during a baseball game the bad vampires show up and they threaten to kill bella
3315692 so edward is in a panic and he feels powerless hes extremely scared we get back to the garage and the entire family comes up with this plan to lead them in a different direction by wearing bellas clothing and rubbing it up against trees misleading the bad vampires
3315693 ive had to fight our kind before were hard to kill
3315694 well rip them apart with our hands then burn the pieces
3315695 i dont relish killing another creature even a sadistic one like james
3315696 i cant let you guys do this this is insane
3315697 ive revealed that im a vampire essentially and bella knows and she still wants to be with me
3315698 im basically testing the waters of how far towards a normal human relationship edward can have i am seeing how much i can actually be physical with her and how much i can say without scaring her off even though ive told her the basics theres still a lot of stuff that i could say that could potentially ruin everything the meadow is like a date scene
3315699 in the big action sequences its a little scary because some people say were going to get done with the action sequences and then well get to the acting scenes
3315700 and its like well thats just not how it works man its hard to keep what youre doing in the rest of the movie consistent you cant lose whats going on with the characters quiet scenes are actually more difficult because you have to strive to not let it go and not just focus on a wall thats being ripped out or something in the more intimate scenes youre given the time to get into it
3315701 i am definitely the only person apart from her and the editor who has read it
3315702 just me and catherine hardwicke it is very top secret and it is like halfway two thirds finished i read that right at the beginning of filming i got a lot of stuff out of that
3315703 its exactly the same events but a couple of other things happen you get the same gist but its funny how different things affect edward in ways that you dont really expect if you have just read twilight
3315704 that is what i liked about taking on the job because the guy doesnt really exist that much so you can just create whatever you want
3315705 then when i found out there was another book from edwards perspective i read it and it turned out we had the same perspective
3315706 mortgage lending activity remains relatively weak and will decline further in the coming months as a result of funding constraints and lower consumer demand
3315707 it is scandalous that hundreds of thousands of older people may be denied treatment because depression is wrongly seen as a natural part of getting older
3315708 older people deserve better treatment there should be no excuse for inaction
3315709 general practitioners have a key role to play in more effectively pinpointing possible depression as patients present themselves
3315710 care home staff and managers must also ensure their own knowledge of symptoms associated with depression is improved
3315711 the consumer slowdown will help the rental market as people struggle to get credit for large purchases the upgrade to new technologies such as flat screen tvs is also boosting our rental business

3315713 i didnt even know what happened until the officers came to tell me last night i dont know why she would have done that
3315714 she was on the verge of getting her license back
3315715 youll see olympians come from this field and youll see professional athletes come from these fields
3315716 we are wildly enthusiastic to be a part of this
3315717 we look forward to the spirit of competition that will take place on our fields
3315718 the best thing about it is it will benefit our kids for many years to come
3315719 ok you two dont worry about me just keep your eyes on each other and be in this moment
3315720 malil and the victim had apparently been in a dating relationship which recently ended
3315721 in a lot of instances we have this picture of private security as blackwater types ex navy seals but a lot of the contracts in afghanistan as i understand them are with local afghan companies
3315722 what youre really concerned about here is whos got guns and where they are
3315723 dnd should have a single point to co ordinate all of the dnd let contracts and it should probably be the same person who is co ordinating all government of canada let contracts in afghanistan
3315724 private security contractors are used for defensive roles primarily such as perimeter security at designated sites
3315725 clearly state that any use of force must be in accordance with applicable law
3315726 were likely to agree that the games are about more than merely medals and marketing

3315731 life is not a problem to be solved but a mystery to be lived
3315732 setting an example is not the main means of influencing another it is the only means

3315738 youre looking at a handful of us most of the guys got out or are broken and cant go
3315739 and we are 100 times more prepared to meet the missions were assigned
3315740 there are some guys in my unit who i dont think want to go
3315741 but two i do like the military i dont like the hurry up and wait aspect but its pretty good plus a lot of my friends were going to be going back
3315742 people always step up and do things out of the ordinary at the olympics
3315743 you have to win eight gold medals to get noticed he wins a gold medal and everyone says one down seven to go people have no idea how hard it is to get up on the blocks and swim out of his mind like that
3315744 whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3315745 we gave our best effort if we came up short hes not going to be looked at as a guy who was on a relay that lost or that he came up short nah hes an amazing athlete probably the best ever in this sport regardless of what happens here hes going to go down as that
3315746 i jumped in the air and almost fell in the pool
3315747 i was thinking if there was anybody on this team or in the world who could do it it would be jason who could pull this off i was pounding on the blocks saying aaaaah come on we looked up at the board and it was phenomenal i dont think anybody in the world could have done a better job without a doubt
3315748 we were the favorites in both of those years this year we were actually considered the underdogs in past olympics it just wasnt attainable theres no way i was going to catch a guy whos two seconds ahead of me
3315749 when i flipped at 50 meters and saw how far ahead he was and he was the world record holder until about two minutes before that the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then i changed i said you know what this is ridiculous its the olympics im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts im going to go out in five seconds i was thinking all these things i got supercharged and just took it from there it was unreal
3315750 he got his hand on the wall and i got chills seeing their reactions and how happy they were
3315751 he was part of it and were part of it whether he wins eight gold medals or not that wasnt our responsibility we just did the best we could do
3315752 i have come that you may have life and have it more abundantly
3315753 all of georgia with the exception of tbilisi is already occupied by the russian troops who conduct genocide

3315755 im honored to know a person like tom ridge who had every opportunity after he graduated from harvard not to go to vietnam
3315756 he could have found a doctor that would have given a certificate that he had a bad knee but instead he went and decided to serve his country during the vietnam war and he came back here to erie
3315757 thats the kind of people that this part of america produces
3315758 call tom ridge to washington from whatever vacation he is taking get him down there and get him to work
3315759 if you cast a universal net my name might be on the list

3315761 we cant reprocess spent nuclear fuel we cant store spent nuclear fuel we cant compete with other countries we cant develop clean coal technology we can thats what americas thats the history of the united states of america we can and we will and sometimes it requires government assistance

3315777 its a definite business advantage and strategic advantage to communicate with clarity and coherence
3315778 all the audiences of these big companies are crying for clarity
3315779 a lot of corporations really dont know who they are
3315780 being able to describe a complex concept clearly and succinctly is really an indication of how well you know that subject
3315781 a lot of these guys they want to throw in the kitchen sink obfuscate with jargon

3315839 when i kept silent about my sin my body wasted away through my groaning all day long for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my vitality was drained away as with the fever heat of summer
3315840 instead of being holy and happy they became sinful and miserable

3315865 the religion of jesus christ is not a system of empty speculations designed to have no practical influence it is not the offspring of wild enthusiasm that exhausts all its force in feeling and leaves none for action god never designed that saved men should have assurance peace and joy in any other proportion that they bring forth the fruits of holiness if you would enjoy the pleasures of religion therefore you must practice its duties if you will not do this you will continue in darkness and doubt while you live on the contrary if you will awake to a life of christian activity you shall have the peace which passeth all understanding that your joy may be full

3315882 paul repeats his thanksgiving for their conversion dwelling especially on the persecutions which they had endured 2 13 16
3315883 when you received from us the word of gods message
3315884 our gospel did not come to you in word only having received the word in much tribulation
3315885 the word of god which also performs its work in you who believe
3315886 our gospel did not come to you in word only but also
3315887 for you brethren became imitators of the churches of god in christ jesus that are in judea
3315888 you also became imitators of us and of the lord
3315889 for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen
3315890 having received the word in much i point this out to you to demonstrate to you how similar the content is between chapter 1 and chapter 2 and the similarities of my sermon title
3315891 constantly bearing in mind your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our lord jesus christ in the presence of our god and father
3315892 you became an example to all the believers in macedonia and in achaia
3315893 for the word of the lord has sounded forth from you not only in macedonia and achaia but also in every place your faith toward god has gone forth so that we have no need to say anything
3315894 for they themselves report about us what kind of a reception we had with you and how you turned to god from idols to serve a living and true god
3315895 and to wait for his son from heaven whom he raised from the dead that is jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come
3315896 for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen even as they did from the jews
3315897 who both killed the lord jesus and the prophets and drove us out they are not pleasing to god but hostile to all men
3315898 hindering us from speaking to the gentiles that they might be saved with the result that they always fill up the measure of their sins but wrath has come upon them to the utmost
3315899 here is the reason why i am thanking god that when you received from us the word of gods message you accepted it not as the word of men but for what it really is the word of god
3315900 when you received from us the word of gods message you accepted it not as the word of men but the word of god
3315901 and those on the rocky soil are those who when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no firm root they believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away
3315902 and in a similar way these are the ones on whom seed was sown on the rocky places who when they hear the word immediately receive it with joy
3315903 turned to god from idols to serve a living and true god
3315904 for his son from heaven as the reigning king whom he raised from the dead that is jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come
3315905 oh how i love thy law it is my meditation day and night
3315906 you received the word of god which also performs its work in you who believe
3315907 when thou didst say seek my face my heart said to thee thy face o l
3315908 i count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing christ jesus my lord
3315909 the true circumcision are those who worship in the spirit of god and glory in christ jesus and put no confidence in the flesh
3315910 he was the last person that i thought would become a christian
3315911 imitators of the churches of god in christ jesus that are in judea for you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen even as they did from the jews
3315912 you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen even as they did from the jews
3315913 kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her
3315914 they were stoned they were sawn in two they were tempted they were put to death with the sword they went about in sheep skins in goatskins being destitute afflicted ill treated
3315915 and on that day a great persecution arose against the church in jerusalem and they were all scattered throughout the regions of judea and samaria
3315916 an unbeliever who is willing to live and let live with respect to personal convictions regarding god is less dangerous than on who not only disbelieves himself but also tries to keep others from hearing the gospel
3315917 thus far you shall come but no farther and here shall your proud waves stop
3315918 fill up the measure of the guilt of your fathers
3315919 god has set bounds to every mans wickedness he suffers men to live and to go on in sin till they have filled up their measure and then cuts them off
3315920 hindering us from speaking to the gentiles that they might be saved
3315921 you who received the law as ordained by angels and yet did not keep it
3315922 never take you own revenge beloved but leave room for the wrath of god for it is written
3315923 you also endured the same sufferings at the hands of your own countrymen even as they did from the jews
3315924 how can a young man keep his way pure by keeping it according to thy word with all my heart i have sought thee do not let me wander from thy commandments thy word i have treasured in my heart that i may not sin against thee
3315925 even though now for a little while if necessary you have been distressed by various trials
3315926 remember the prisoners as though in prison with them and those who are ill treated since you yourselves also are in the body
3315927 be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life
3315928 i have on my body the brand marks of jesus but i cant but i know that gods word is sufficient to carry you and me through the trials that may come upon us
3315929 i was never present at any trial of christians therefore i do not know what are the customary penalties or investigation and what limits are observed this is the course that i have adopted in the case of those brought before me as christians i ask them if they are christians if they admit it i repeat the question a second and a third time threatening capital punishment if they persist i sentence them to death for i do not doubt that whatever kind of crime it may be to which they have confessed their pertinacity and inflexible obstinacy should certainly be punished
3315930 you have taken the right line my dear pliny in examining the cases of those denounced to you as christians for no hard and fast rule can be laid down of universal application they are not to be sought out if they are informed against and the charge is proved they are to be punished with this reservation that if any one denies that he is a christian and actually proves it that is by worshipping our gods he shall be pardoned as a result of his recantation however suspect he may have been with respect to the past

3315979 some parents in such areas are reluctant to pay the expected fees of the private institutions which are most often very low and also give money for feeding which development takes the children out of school so i think the government should seriously consider extending the capitation grant and the school feeding programme to the private schools at least in such deprived areas in order to lessen the burden of parents and give the children the privilege to also be in school just like their urban counterparts

3316000 noi scriitorii cei care consideram cartea ca si cel mai important mijloc de comunicare dezvoltare si culturalizare a societatii dezaprobam categoric actiunile lui iurie rosca care a declansat o campanie fara precedent de denigrare a politicienilor democrati cartea a fost din totdeauna izvor al intelepciunii si mesager al tolerantei si compasiunii mai mult decat atat in basarabia cuvantul scris a avut in vremuri grele rolul de a ilumina oamenii iar lupta pentru litera romaneasca a fost cauza mai multor generatii

3316219 siamo tutti consapevoli delle carenze dorganico delle forze dellordine e non a caso nel nostro passato programma politico si proponeva linnalzamento dei finanziamenti rivolti a tali settori
3316220 veniamo da lontano stessa sorte un solo cuore vecchia fiamma che non muore una nuova libert
3316221 bh io ho fatto a meno del msft per tanti anni se si scioglie riprender a farne a meno mi spiace piuttosto per questi
3316222 ma io credo nel nostro segretario e so che lui pi di tutti noi non vuole la fine della fiamma
3316223 non c un met del rimborso se lo cucca romagnoli a noi restan solo le cambiali da pagare
3316224 non c un del rimborso del 13 aprile ci danno un misero 10 si tengono tutto gli avidi di ld
3316225 abbiamo deciso di seguire buona parte della base della fiamma tricolore che ora ha traslocato nel movimento casa pound italia
3316226 siamo stufi di essere presi in giro da una dirigenza nazionale incopetente arrogantee degna di venire paragonata alla precedente gestione dellonpino rauti
3316227 casa pound italia rappresenta al pieno tutte le nostre aspirazioni ideologiche politiche e per questo intendiamo seguire lesempio avanguardista delle occupazioni non conforme romane ci sentiamo di promettere sin da ora la nascita di un centro libraio non conforme e di una associazione culturale al fine di poter dare vita a progetti sociali e culturali al servizio della cittadinanza a partire dal prossimo ottobre
3316228 la mia idea di politica si fermata il 22 maggio del 1988 il giorno in cui si sono svolti i funerali del segretario almirante e che coincide con linizio dellestinzione della comunit missina
3316229 dopo aver considerato gli avvenimenti e i cambiamenti avvenuti negli ultimi mesi a livello nazionale
3316230 si effettivamente a far certe porcherie eandare in giro come nulla fosse ci vuole un bel coraggio
3316231 ricordo bene il nostro ultimo incontro e il mio commiato allora
3316232 ho molte pi speranze di vedere sulla scheda marrone delle europee la goccia tricolore del msft che non la torcia di ld
3316233 nel 2008 noi avevamo lesonero romagnoli no ma lo abbiamo accolto in lista ora a parti inverse lui ingrato non ricambia alle provinciali di milano abbiam raccolto le firme ed ecco il simbolo
3316234 se rifiutiamo di inserire in lista una santanch che si frega il seggio ma almeno porta mezzo milione di voti figuriamoci se tirar dentro chi selo frega portandone solo centomila
3316235 qual pena irrogare in campo de fiori o altrove al federale di roma credo che non troverei il tempo di intervenire
3316236 prender virilmente atto dellinsuccesso o mancato successo e scioglierci nel pdl o altrove
3316237 ci vediamo al congresso e chi ha pi numeri vincer
3316238 i vecchi missini da an non possono certo accettare tali affermazioni lo metteranno in minoranza
3316239 anche nella nostra citt dichiara lo stesso putort abbiamo dato vita al progetto

3316243 non ci riconosciamo pi nel cosiddetto pdl e aderiamo in massa a la destra di francesco storace che da solo sta combattendo contro il sistema dei vecchi partiti

3316248 e che ci sciogliamo solo perch girata la voce che forse mettono lo sbarramento al 5
3316249 ancora una volta daniela santanch mostra coerenza e capacit di immaginare un percorso politico che dia lopportunit a militanti ed elettori di destra di dialogare con il popolo della libert che oggi rappresenta il principale interlocutore del quadro politico istituzionale
3316250 e ormai inprocastinabile oltre la convocazione dellesecutivo politico nazionale e lo chieder io stesso oggi al segretario nazionale storace per chiarire le affermazioni della nostra portavoce santanche pubblicate oggi sui quotidiani nazionali
3316251 metti tre fascisti in una stanza e dopo una settimana avranno fondato quattro partiti
3316252 mentre quella allinterno della ft la vedo ormai di retroguardia
3316253 oltre alle petizioni on line lanciate nelle scorse settimane vogliamo dare un segno tangibile della nostra presenza a sostegno del popolo tibetano richiamando a roma centinaia di giovani ad affermarlo stefano savoca vice portavoce regionale del movimento giovanile di la destra che fa capo a francesco storace e a teodoro buontempo non guardare in tv le olimpiadi significher disapprovare la quotidiana violazione di diritti umani perpetrata ai danni di questo popolo come di tutti i popoli oppressi
3316254 c stata fumata bianca si va ha spiegato verso un pdl equilibrato e coeso
3316255 an ha il 30 di rappresentanti mentre forza italia il 70 che include per anche i partiti minori in modo da realizzare velocemente questo percorso
3316256 nel percorso verso la nascita del pdl fermo restando quanto stabilito nel documento di intesa tra berlusconi e fini di febbraio 2008 in un incontro con il presidente berlusconi il ministro la russa e lonorevole verdini al quale stato invitato anche il segretario della dca gianfranco rotondi si proceduto a definire un comitato costituente del pdl che oltre ai promotori an e fi vedr la partecipazione di tutti i soggetti che hanno gi dato vita a liste comuni a camera e senato
3316257 in particolare scritto nella nota nellorganismo presieduto da verdini e la russa in cui an sar rappresentata al 30 dei partecipanti saranno rappresentate oltre ovviamente a forza italia tutte le formazioni politiche che gi fanno parte dei gruppi parlamentari comuni del pdl e stata fissata per il 10 settembre la riunione del comitato costituente a roma mentre per il 18 agosto la prima riunione della commissione statuto che dovr redigere la bozza di regole comuni del pdl
3316258 il voto conferito a un partito utile quando viene utilizzato per il fine per il quale stato conferito inutile quando non viene utilizzato per il fine per il quale stato conferito dannoso quando viene utilizzato per il fine opposto a quello per il quale stato conferito votare per il mio partito utile perch il mio partito chiede voti per lopposizione a tutti i livelli e li utilizza per lopposizione a tutti i livelli lei da buon democratico mi insegna che in democrazia lopposizione tanto importante quanto il governo a condizione che si tratti di una vera opposizione e non di una sceneggiata come quella che in questo momento recitano le false opposizioni che dicono di combattere il governo e i partiti di governo ma la tempo stesso lottizzano con il governo e i partiti di governo le posizioni di potere quanto al frigorifero noi manteniamo intatti i voti che riceviamo perch li utilizziamo con fedelt e coerenza e non ce ne serviamo per baratti di alcun genere
3316259 io penso e affermo che fuori dalla vera legittimit costituzionale si pongono quei partiti che rifiutano di attivare gli articoli sociali della costituzione 39 40 e 46 che interpretano in maniera distorta larticolo 49 e dal pluralismo fanno nascere il mostro che si chiama partitocrazia penso e affermo che fuori della costituzione siano quei partiti che lottizzano in termini di potere e quindi di arbitrio la libert di informazione attraverso il mezzo radio televisivo le chiedo anche se abbia avuto modo di conoscere i lineamenti del sistema da noi posto in alternativa presidente della repubblica eletto direttamente dal popolo presidente del consiglio e ministri nominati dal presidente della repubblica senza forcipe di partiti e senza manuali cencelli parlamento eletto direttamente e pluralisticamente ma con la partecipazione di rappresentanze elette delle categorie del mondo del lavoro della produzione della tecnica della cultura e dellarte tutto questo solo idealismo se fosse ne sarei orgoglioso ma io sono fiero di ben altro isolato nei confronti di un paese legale sempre pi lontano dal paese reale ho lorgoglio di essere sempre pi vicino alle esigenze alle speranze e quindi alla comprensione del paese reale cio del popolo italiano
3316260 che strana domanda dottor montanelli ma come pu saltarle in mente visto che lei un uomo che crede nella libert che il segretario di un partito possa dissolvere il suo partito e possa addirittura dopo averlo dissolto farne confluire i voti in altre direzioni centinaia di migliaia di iscritti e almeno due milioni di elettori ma in questo momento siamo di pi dovrebbero obbedire al dittatore almirante per accettare da un momento allaltro di dissolversi e poi di confluire dissolversi cio scomparire come fatto politico come fatto di coscienza come fatto morale come fatto di impegno fisico e spirituale confluire cio abbracciare unaltra fede unaltra dottrina un altro e molto diverso credo politico rinnegando dun colpo se stessi
3316261 non sentiamo il bisogno di ripudiare il nostro passato consapevoli di aver certamente errori da rimpiangere ma non delitti o tradimenti di cui vergognarci
3316262 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3316263 world history is often made in remote obscure countries it is being made in georgia today
3316264 the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3316265 both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states of america
3316266 the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated
3316267 there have been many turning points for good and ill this is another turning point let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people we want russia to play its rightful role as a great nation but with that role comes the responsibility to act as a force for progress in this new century not regression to the conflicts of the past that is why the united states and the international community must speak out strongly against this aggression and for peace and security
3316268 i looked into mr putins eyes and i saw three things a k and a g and a b
3316269 the kremlin and the obama campaign are using the same talking points to attack john mccains statement against russian aggression in georgia
3316270 a cheap shot at me as if helping a struggling democracy is somehow wrong
3316271 because our standing in the world is so low and so weak were not able to
3316272 it is a cold war type scenario already and pretending otherwise is misreading the writing on the wall russia has demonstrated its desire to ignore international public opinion and use force
3316273 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3316274 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3316275 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3316276 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material
3316277 now they feel that school is over all they want to do is watch tv or just lay back on the computer and eat
3316278 its like no school video game city its really very sad
3316279 you would think the summer would be a time when kids are really active and running around
3316280 for many kids its the opposite they have a lot of down time in the summer that theyre trying to fill
3316281 summer can be a very difficult time financially for families
3316282 so this is a particularly interesting time to be thinking about the influences of this summer on obesity and kids
3316283 we asked the question when it comes to childhood obesity are schools more part of the solution or more part of the problem
3316284 families have agendas that are related to vacation and traveling so its very difficult for the child to adhere to
3316285 and then theyre not on a good schedule at home because there are times when they are bored and they have more access to the refrigerator because the parent is at work
3316286 because it affects both ends of the energy balance equation
3316287 when children are watching television theyre not at the beach or playing basketball in the back yard burning off calories but also theyre receiving an unending series of messages by way of commercials to eat the highest calorie lowest quality food imaginable
3316288 a lot of the kids today dont have the basic fundamental games that we did
3316289 we are really going to feel the effects that technology is having on our children in 10 years and were all going to pay a steep cost
3316290 when theyre in school they have their breakfast their lunch
3316291 summertime brings the ice cream the smoothies all the tempting stuff this will help them resist that when theyre adults
3316292 she was not at that mindset when i knew her i dont what could have led to that
3316293 both of them were looking like they were prepared for suicide
3316294 she doesnt know how many years but it was the same location and her captors were americans and the treatment was horrendous
3316295 kindly fill the pledge form and return to al kifah
3316296 she shared with us that we should never make excuses for who we are
3316297 she said americans have no respect for people who are weak
3316298 she was petrified because the fbi had put her on a most wanted list
3316299 for several years we have had no information regarding her whereabouts whatsoever
3316300 it is our belief that she has all this time been concealed from the public view by her own choosing
3316301 hes fabulous hes a guy who makes tough decisions he takes charge hes ready to sacrifice his interest on behalf of the interest of the country
3316302 he does justice sometimes against insurmountable odds and he doesnt make his good works known to a lot of people
3316303 an ever changing work in progress as authentic as a pair of designer jeans
3316304 its the thing that nobody wants to talk about but its obviously a huge factor
3316305 stopping russia the us and its allies must unite against moscows war on georgia
3316306 this is a grave challenge to the united states and europe
3316307 the united states and its nato allies must together impose a price on russia
3316308 but john mccain is four more years of george w bush
3316309 the danger from iran is grave it is real and my goal will be to eliminate this threat
3316310 let there be no doubt i will always keep the threat of military action on the table to defend our security and our ally israel sometimes there are no alternatives to confrontation
3316311 michael moore is a supporter of yours and has endorsed you but in his new book mikes election guide he says the following go ahead and fill in the blank ive provided a full list of outrageously offensive lines already taken out of context in advance to make it easy for rightwing commentators and fox news will you still accept his endorsement or do you denounce him
3316312 laguardia airport and the intrepid museum have long been a piece of new yorks notable aviation history and we are proud to have the food amp shops offer visitors an opportunity to be part of this exciting celebration
3316313 es gibt mehr im leben als den t glichen verkehr zu beobachten und streunende katzen an sich urinieren zu lassen
3316314 der heinzelmann ging vor vielen vielen monaten verloren und ich habe ihn total vergessen
3316315 dann habe ich die t r aufgemacht und gesehen dass er zur ck war welch ein schock
3316316 aber meine neugierde hat letztendlich gesiegt ich dachte erst es explodiert vielleicht
3316317 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
3316318 a return by the parties to the status quo of august the 6th
3316319 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate ceasefire
3316320 for many years i have warned against russian actions that undermine the sovereignty of its neighbours
3316321 commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia
3316322 those who have been supplying arms to georgia i believe they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life of civilians including many russian citizens and peacekeepers i think those who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis aggressive intentions and who helped create a feeling of impunity among the georgian leadership should think twice
3316323 so far each step in the caucasus drama has put the conflict on a yet higher plane the next step will no longer be just about the caucasus or even europe remember the guns of august
3316324 no habr problemas para nada todo el plan sigue en pie ya est n ensayando y la verdad es que est quedando padr simo

3316332 we closed our slow season with a high note as we continue to outpace our market growth and win accounts from our competitors while we continue to expand market share among chinese domestic branded auto makers we are also increasingly pursing businesses from european joint venture auto makers in china we now have two major european auto powerhouses volkswagen and peugeot in our customer list for domestic china market as we strive to increase the shipment to those oems our next target is american auto makers
3316333 after winning the faw volkswagen contract last year we are excited to enter another european automakers auto parts purchasing system in china after an almost three year evaluation peugeot has approved the performance and quality of our products to be installed in their flagship vehicles in china we will continue to focus on broadening our product offerings and maintaining high quality standards to win key contracts from major automakers in china
3316334 while global and chinese auto and auto parts markets are experiencing pressure from higher raw material prices and lower average selling prices we have incorporated a series of efficiency measures to optimize our manufacturing facilities while providing growth also since the first quarter the unit cost of commercial vehicles steering gear increased due to the sharp rise of the price of steel its main raw material we also successfully negotiated with our customers and raised the selling price of commercial vehicles steering gear as a result we maintained our gross margin over 30
3316335 redefined the standards of success by creating a workplace that encourages the retention and advancement of women
3316336 arent fox is proud to be recognized as one of the best places to work for women and working mothers
3316337 one of our firms core strengths has been our longstanding commitment to women in early 2007 arent fox formalized that commitment by launching the womens leadership development initiative which works to facilitate mentoring and training programs that contribute to the retention of our women lawyers and ensure that women serve on firmwide committees with the ultimate goal of advancing even more of them into leadership roles
3316338 today nearly half of law school graduates are women law firms need to make a fundamental shift in their policies by instituting female and family friendly benefits as arent fox has done
3316339 we hope that by recognizing arent fox which has already moved the needle a paradigm shift will follow
3316340 other law firms should take notice of arent foxs commitment to change and competition we hope our recognition of arent fox will encourage additional firms to devise more creative ways to enhance the work life balance and improve the status of women in the profession

3316342 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion for a 2013 flight has closed
3316343 since the programs inception nasa has been working an aggressive plan to achieve flight capability before our march 2015 target
3316344 during the second quarter we continued to put in place the building blocks for long term value creation by adding 100 megawatts under two long term vpc contracts and 94 megawatts for commercial and industrial open market programs
3316345 that brings our total megawatts under management to 2075 which includes 40 megawatts subject to regulatory approval
3316346 our full year revenue outlook has been impacted by a regulatory change in grid operator pjms rules for its economic program which will result in a reduction in the revenues we receive under economic or voluntary demand response programs
3316347 as to the second quarter approximately 3 million in expected revenues with solid gross margins from pes installations completed in the second quarter will not be realized until the third quarter since our utility customer was not able to perform the required audits in time we continue to be excited about the underlying growth in our business as evidenced by achieving a key milestone of over two gigawatts under management
3316348 the growth in these metrics demonstrates that we continue to execute on our plan for growing the company and building value over the long term
3316349 we dont usually post about problems like this on our blog but we wanted to make an exception in this case since so many people were impacted
3316350 if this was truly limited to a subset of users and it happened to be affecting the google apps account your business uses to provide email to employees what good is a simple user group
3316351 if elected a liberal government will repeal labors soft cannabis laws
3316352 they were a mistake when they were introduced and they have had a damaging effect on young people in western australia
3316353 we have put plenty of police in but many people in there have complex issues
3316354 we cant do everything and the chaplains will offer a service to complement what the police do
3316355 well be offering ourselves to care for people in crisis
3316356 the emphasis is on offer were not going to bust in on people
3316357 we are there to sort out the odd fight help people who might be a bit depressed and be there as a listening ear for them
3316358 all the ambos the police and the bouncers know them
3316359 they trust the chief chaplain so much that hell take duty of care in an emergency situation including administering first aid
3316360 but for now the two rostered chaplains will have phones to call the police and ambos if anything serious is encountered
3316361 well be doing just what jesus christ did compassionately caring for people
3316362 the street chaplains service will be a great addition to the services provided by police
3316363 they will be very friendly and not intimidating at all
3316364 they are there to give help and support and when its needed refer people on to agencies that can help
3316365 i had no idea that when former senator john edwards invited me to come along on his plane back in december of 2006 that i would have had a front row seat to a sex scandal
3316366 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly but that misconduct took place for a short period in 2006 it ended then
3316367 the government intends all expenditure planned for these projects or any alterations will continue to be used for public transport projects that tackle congestion connectivity and journey times in edinburgh and across scotland
3316368 when im in south africa i work with township children and the streets are inevitably decayed
3316369 im left thinking that a lovely area like dalneigh is being made like that there are so many rubbish bins yet if someone has an empty bottle they chuck it on the ground
3316370 i think theyre probably bored and i think they just dont have the respect
3316371 it affects the community because people especially those that are vulnerable would rather stay indoors than have to go and face it and thats not really right and its not necessary
3316372 i look at all the other houses and i wish we had a fence because it would help us to be more private
3316373 ive had yoghurt thrown on my car and stones put under the tyres and those kind of things that are irritating
3316374 im disabled and i cant get under the car to move the stones away they also put the stones down my drain which blocks it up you cant see them or talk to them because they run off
3316375 if thats the only thing stopping them housing officials thats ridiculous
3316376 there are always ways around wee problems like that people are wanting peace of mind and to feel safe in their homes we have to do everything in our power to make sure that happens
3316377 why should somebody who lives 30 seconds down the road have it while we have none yet they pay the same rates
3316378 this type of fencing provides degrees of protection security and privacy
3316379 against aberdeen russell duncan broke up the play really well
3316380 he has a great understanding of the game but never seems to get all that much praise for what he does
3316381 some of the fans perhaps dont realise just how important that role is in terms of simply trying to disrupt the oppositions play winning the ball back and then keeping it simple but russell duncan does that for us to good effect
3316382 i also thought that roy mcbain was tremendous and it was quite fitting that he played his 300th game for the club on saturday capping it all off with a goal
3316383 both these players are vital to have in the squad because i want to have a good blend of youth and experience and i think ive got that
3316384 there has been an emphasis on bringing in young players recently but being experienced campaigners russell and roy still have a huge part to play at this club both on and off the pitch
3316385 its always nice to get off to a positive start but what was more pleasing was the manner in which we did it
3316386 i was always quietly confident going into the game having watched the boys prepare for the past six weeks
3316387 but to put on such a good all round display was very encouraging
3316388 however the hard work now starts again the aberdeen game is gone now and we have to put it to bed and focus on saturdays game against hamilton
3316389 malky thomson assistant manager at caley thistle will be at hamilton to watch them in action while i got the chance to see them once or twice last season and theyve got some fairly good players
3316390 from my own point of view however it will be about making sure my players are properly prepared and ready to put on another good performance
3316391 i have been wrong this wrongness counts against me please take this wrongness away so that it doesnt count against me anymore
3316392 will it help you to break through all existing barriers
3316393 what little mortal baby steps can i take today that will demonstrate expectancy prepare for my dreams manifestation and above all place me within reach of lifes magic
3316394 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3316395 that would be fantastic obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3316396 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3316397 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3316398 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3316399 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3316400 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3316401 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3316402 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3316403 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3316404 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3316405 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3316406 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3316407 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3316408 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3316409 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3316410 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3316411 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3316412 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3316413 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act

3316565 la enfermedad ha alcanzado cifras alarmantes m s de 33 millones de contagiados han muerto m s de 2 millones de personas en 2007 y en ese mismo a o lo han contra do de nuevo 2 5 millones de personas
3316566 no puede decirse recuerda que la iglesia cat lica se desentiende del tema como en tantas otras enfermedades incluso contagiosas el amor de cristo ha llevado a atender con riesgo de la propia
3316567 la postura m s frecuente es la de propiciar el mediante el uso del preservativo la iglesia cat lica sin embargo propone otros caminos m s positivos y eso le lleva a situarse contracorriente buscando el bien integral de las personas el preservativo es un tap n no siempre eficaz la propuesta debe llevar a educar en el amor verdadero
3316568 en este campo del sida como en todos los que incluyen el recto uso de la sexualidad la iglesia presenta la propuesta del amor verdadero que lleva consigo una buena educaci n en la virtud de la castidad
3316569 no se puede proponer a los adolescentes y j venes el uso sin freno de su propia sexualidad en aras de una mayor libertad eso de entrada gusta a los o dos pero por este camino el hombre se hace esclavo de sus propios ego smos y no aprender nunca a amar de verdad
3316570 curiosamente las cifras de contagio del sida se disparan con estas propuestas moral
3316571 experiencias concretas como la de uganda donde a trav s de los hospitales cat licos se ha puesto en pr ctica esta propuesta han reducido las cifras del sida del 80 al 10 ning n otro programa ha conseguido una reducci n tan dr stica

3316576 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3316577 we are finding that breastfeeding rates arent just explained by the individuals who live in these areas theres something about the areas themselves and breastfeeding
3316578 where the need is greatest breastfeeding happens the least its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3316579 use a smile as a noun and i think like a verb
3316580 we are concerned that there is a great deal of external inspiration and support we are also concerned and are looking at a mastermind within the country
3316581 clearly there is some kind of organisation we have to find out if that organisation is localised or there is an external group or module operating
3316582 like putting bombs in vehicles near hospitals soon after blasts knowing that large congregations will be there and impact will be much greater
3316583 i would never use my body in that way im just not that kind of girl
3316584 im actually trying really hard to be out of the public eye as im really proud of the work ive put into my album and i want people to appreciate the music
3316585 i wore a loose fitting t shirt it was very hot in london and
3316586 can i just say i have been keeping myself very much to myself recently ive been gardening decorating my new flat and looking after my grieving grandfather
3316587 if i wanted publicity id be accepting invitations not to mention money for turning up to glamorous events

3316590 i know the audience seeks another rishi kapoor in me but i can never be like him he is such a spontaneous actor
3316591 no one can play the role of bobby like dimple kapadia did she is still so beautiful and i would love to woo her on screen again if a remake is made
3316592 i play a next door boy and the film is about his love life at different phases of life
3316593 in both saawariya and bachna ae haseeno i play a lover boy but wont keep myself confined to that particular image give me two years and you will find me beating up goons and kicking in the air
3316594 my first film saawariya was not a commercially hit one though it was the best possible launch that one can ever have but this time i expect my film to be a commercially hit one
3316595 both of us have just started our career we would appreciate if people talk about the film and our characters instead of linking our personal life with the romance on screen
3316596 right from amitabh bachchan to darsheel safary bollywood has never been so competitive every day a new actor takes the reign as a result we actors have to constantly groom ourselves
3316597 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3316598 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct

3316601 this is no time for confrontation and we want to strengthen the democratic process thats why we have decided to support the impeachment motion

3316603 the move aims to better govern the military according to the law and maintain a good image of the air force with strict measures
3316604 officers would be demoted or dismissed while soldiers were to face demerit if caught driving after drinking
3316605 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3316606 we can hardly agree with this because it would assume the presence of people described as georgian peacekeepers
3316607 they can no longer remain they brought shame upon themselves as peacekeepers they committed crimes
3316608 our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3316609 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3316610 it is not in our tradition to topple anyone or put someone on a throne
3316611 however russias justified response to georgias unprovoked attack on south ossetia is no different to natos barbaric attack on serbia for seeking to recontrol areas of kosovo imbued with islamic terrorists
3316612 military means are not a feasible way of reversing the russian anschluss with abkhazia and south ossetia
3316613 i was just emptying the stuff out of the back of the car and i saw something that i thought was a rubber snake but it definitely wasnt it went away behind the panelling so we phoned the sspca
3316614 it gave me a fright because we didnt know exactly what it was it could have been anything
3316615 everybody in the garage kept their distance and we just waited until they came and they managed to get it out
3316616 thats the first time ive found anything like that and i hope itll be the last
3316617 when i got there all the guys were about a million miles away from the car they just pointed and said its that one over there i persuaded them that it would probably be a non venomous snake and they came a little bit closer
3316618 it had gone through a small hole and it was stretched along the side of the panel
3316619 it actually turned round and poked its head out of the hole wed cut which was quite lucky it was just putting its tongue out and tasting the air so i got a pillowcase that i had with me and put its over the snakes head and took hold of its neck
3316620 our contractors often contact me for advice on valuable or unusual property found in uplifted vehicles but this takes the biscuit
3316621 sometimes we can find knives or baseball bats hidden in vehicles but the snake is something no one would want to find let alone handle
3316622 the operation to liberate kodori gorge has started our troops are making advances we are hoping for success
3316623 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3316624 there is of course a variety of other measures political or economic
3316625 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed in the minds of several us diplomats
3316626 our wine comes from europe so the euro affects it you have also got all the added fuel costs and the price of raw materials going up
3316627 theres no doubt that the credit crunch is affecting all products within the industry
3316628 an unqualified driver more than twice the limit driving at 50mph in a 30mph area is clearly dangerous driving
3316629 i think this decision to allow him to plead guilty to careless driving is pretty poor there has been a lot of criticism in recent years over excessive leniency in charges involving driving and this seems to be another example
3316630 careless driving suggests causing an accident through carelessness drinking then trying to escape from the police isnt careless its clearly dangerous im not pleased with the decision
3316631 i fully understand sheriff lothians concerns whilst the speed was not grossly excessive the circumstances still merited a dangerous driving charge
3316632 we will of course consider carefully the comments made by sheriff lothian in relation to this case the penalties for drink driving and dangerous driving are similar
3316633 in making his decision the depute fiscal weighed up the public interest in securing the certainty of a conviction and disqualification against the uncertainty of the outcome of a trial
3316634 we have a number of serious concerns about the quality of care being delivered these have been raised both during our own inspections and as a result of complaints we have investigated
3316635 we are currently working extremely closely with the care home management with southern cross and with east lothian council to ensure improvements are made immediately
3316636 ive come on at night and found i was the only nurse on duty i was working with two young care assistants who had very little experience
3316637 following an inspection by the care commission ten days ago we were informed that seven requirements highlighted during a previous inspection have now been met and three partially met
3316638 we will continue working closely with the care commission and east lothian council to ensure the delivery of a quality service to all our residents
3316639 we were all stunned when we saw this bill and there has to have been a mistake somewhere
3316640 im not even sure if it would be possible for us to use that much electricity and it is even more surprising as we were told not too long ago we were overpaying
3316641 it seems staggering that they appear to have just come up with this figure out of nowhere the reference numbers they have given us for these two meters that were supposedly unpaid do not correspond to any meters here
3316642 what makes this worse is that all they will say to us is that we need to pay and that they can help us set up an instalment payment scheme
3316643 we have spoken to our solicitors and we want them to come down to the site and do a meter reading with us to clear this up
3316644 we are currently looking at the account involving the edinburgh masonic club and will be sending out an engineer to check the meters in the coming days
3316645 it was quite tricky i remember and did result in rather a lot of injuries
3316646 i learned to do it in about two weeks and then never used the skill again until my daughter was raising money to do charity work during her gap year
3316647 i decided to do the union canal which had just opened as the paths there are quite straight and smooth and i thought if i did crash into the water i would be able to swim
3316648 i managed it although i did pick up a lot of injuries
3316649 you need a relatively smooth straight path for this and it is too slow and dangerous to do on public roads so well just cycle normally there
3316650 ill be taking along plenty of repair equipment for the bike and for myself as i expect to fall off quite a few times
3316651 he said it was a fantastic idea as he said backwards cycling is the most efficient method because it cuts down on wind resistance
3316652 professor nelson playing himself has dramatic fist fights lifts weights champagne is poured equipment is brandished he mooches in glamorous strip bars attractive women stroke him and evildoers in cars suppressive agents of the pharmaceutical industry we suspect try to run him off the road
3316653 we took all the criteria distance access to public transport number of people using it deprivation indices and based on that all 11 of my local post offices will not be eligible for closure im confident
3316654 from what i know we will be able to stay open im delighted it has taken all the pressure off me so im more relaxed now im now waiting to see if i can get the land next door so i can expand
3316655 id be most surprised if they had closed this office but we are relieved that the uncertainty is now over
3316656 i dont know for definite yet but it looks ok i feel happy for the local people because if we close theyd have to get buses to other post offices its the pensioners that are really dependent on us
3316657 theres a lot of post offices in the country that i think will close
3316658 i wrote previously to the headmaster detailing a specific incident which involved youths drinking kicking bottles urinating and shouting at the top of their voices for the entire evening with no concern for the hour or for the distress they were causing to those around them
3316659 at times we have had groups play through until 4am
3316660 closing the playground would be a disaster in terms of local provision other schools in the city should follow their example
3316661 if they close this playground the kids will just have to go somewhere else i can understand their concerns if there are people playing late at night but this is only a small minority
3316662 the football pitches and basketball court were built as part of an initiative to give young people more recreational space to close it at night might be an extreme measure
3316663 the school feels that if they closed it at night the young people would still find some way of getting in
3316664 weve always felt that edinburghs potential as a sunday leisure and retail centre was and is a fantastic opportunity for us
3316665 no other city centre in the uk even europe matches scotlands capital for its unique environment and heritage
3316666 by introducing a month of sundays were reminding local people of just how much fun they can have on a sunday in the city centre at any time of year
3316667 we realise the work to bring a 21st century tram scheme to the city cannot be done without some disruption and we are doing all we can to minimise this
3316668 month of sundays has something for everyone and i am confident shoppers will be enticed into the city during those days
3316669 its obviously something that is capable of inflicting a nasty injury but its not in the same category as a knife or an axe so im not going to consider custody
3316670 people are still getting married and having stag weekends and we are finding they are less likely to go abroad and more likely to come here
3316671 people might be spending less generally but were not seeing any downturn they pull in the purse strings in other areas whether its food or home spending but after a tough week they are still wanting to enjoy themselves
3316672 i know from speaking to a lot of hoteliers that they are getting a lot more short breaks because people are just not going away
3316673 with the strength of the euro and more people tending to spend more time in britain rather than abroad it does seem that there are more domestic visitors to edinburgh
3316674 there is nothing wrong with that type of business stag and hen parties as long as it is controlled there has been problems with people targeting stag and hen parties with cheaper drink offers in edinburgh in the past and that can lead to problems
3316675 but that kind of discounting is not happening any more so it can only be a good thing
3316676 this is extremely encouraging to see edinburgh visitor attractions reaping the benefits of an increased domestic market and this will potentially have knock on effects for other tourism businesses in the area
3316677 due to the economic climate there may well be a greater number of people exploring their own country and partaking in activities as a cheaper alternative to flying abroad
3316678 i would have loved to have medaled in that event
3316679 i guess a lot of people thought it was a long shot but in my mind i definitely thought it was a possibility
3316680 whereas civilized discourse is the norm in an academic community at hccc there appears to be an atmosphere of fear and intimidation that permeates all levels of administration and members of the faculty

3316692 modern fiats are actually pretty respectable thanks to modernization of materials and manufacturing processes unfortunately most americans still think of the old phrase fix it again tony because fiat has not sold cars in north america since 1982 and therefore that is the last fiat anyone there has usually seen
3316693 as it happens im not in the market to buy a car
3316694 but if i was then the punto wouldnt make it anywhere on the list
3316695 it feels good to say i played my first game as a pro
3316696 just like i expected the speed of the game in the nfl is a lot faster
3316697 the assets sold were in companies located in scandinavia britain and the netherlands
3316698 the americans are doing so well they may get a second juice after recess
3316699 clearly an exit from the time warner equity state into a cash generating asset would be attractive but at the current time none have been proposed that we could take action on
3316700 but we would continue to try and maintain the relationship with jeff and the time warner folks in the event that such a transaction would present itself
3316701 they would come talk to us given our ability to tax efficient transaction for both parties we have good dialogue with them

3316714 i would just appeal to you and to our legislators to look for other sources that wont cause people to be losers all across the state
3316715 if you dont agree with this particular source lets find some other source
3316716 we need to hear from the people what theyre willing to do

3316719 the saudi man is suspected to have been involved in burgling several shops and engaging in some other illegal activities
3316720 the arrested man has also been working as a teacher in an school and is 33 years old
3316721 my office communicated with the police to learn of the details about the issue if the allegations against him are proved appropriate action would be taken
3316722 if any administrative violation is proved against the imam the case would be handled by the ministrys branch and penal action would depend on the magnitude of the violation
3316723 we have always been criticised for too many tickets going to the fat cats
3316724 but we are confident that at least 80 in 2010 will go to the general public
3316725 it is in much the same way as you book a movie ticket by phone or online these days using your credit card and then when you get there you access your ticket through an atm type machine
3316726 david beckham was one of the reasons we wanted to come to this game
3316727 david beckham brings class to the game in america he whips the ball in the mixer
3316728 i dont care as long as theyre here and as long as theyre watching the game
3316729 whether its because of my celebrity or whether they just want to see a soccer game its so important that people turn out and enjoy the game
3316730 david is to major league soccer in many ways what michael jordan was to the nba basketball or wayne gretzky was to the nhl hockey
3316731 when they go on the road the attendances are far higher and thats a good thing because more people are experimenting with soccer in america
3316732 our goal is not to beat the nfl or beat the nba our goal is to be a respected sport
3316733 there is no doubt in our mind that we will be a major major league in the united states at some point
3316734 its going well and thats obviously what this game needs in this country the hypes there weve got to keep it going
3316735 a lot of players still need to work on their own game and that means they cant think for the team so you have to start at the beginning
3316736 a letter grade in the window has proven to be one of the most powerful incentives for restaurants to perform well on inspections
3316737 who wants to eat at a c restaurant if a restaurant next door gets an a unfortunately in many of the cities we looked at not only are there are no letter grades but the actual inspection reports are nearly impossible for citizens to obtain or understand
3316738 the results of our grading system in los angeles have been very positive with improved restaurant sanitary practices reduced rates of severe food borne illness and high consumer confidence in this key public health regulatory system
3316739 we appreciate the work of cspi to encourage greater adoption of this important food safety improvement that can benefit everybody who eats out
3316740 it is great to join an agency with such a strong focus on integrated media and this was one of the major attractions of coming to zed
3316741 im looking forward to continuing to develop zeds affiliate expertise and playing an integral part within the team
3316742 it became clear to us that theres an untapped opportunity for brand experts who understand how digital behaviour factors into a companys brand so we decided to formalise a practice led by marc shillum called r ga brand design which we plan to integrate into our total agency offering
3316743 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3316744 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3316745 its clear that the mobile industry is looking for more streamlined ways to on board and manage content and services
3316746 it can typically take months to introduce new mobile content and services across all the carriers this clearly needs to change as content and services lose relevancy with each passing month and some content is never considered because of the production time mobile service and content providers need to be able to react to the market quickly and provision new mobile content and services in a more dynamic fashion

3316748 this is an extremely rare case of co infection in a controlled monogamous relationship which showed us how a strong immune system in the elite suppressor kept the virus from replicating and infecting other cells
3316749 our findings offer hope to vaccine researchers because they reveal that the immune systems primary offense known as cd8 killer t cells can effectively halt disease progression by a pathogenic form of hiv
3316750 moreover the strength of the immune response was not dependent on infection by a weakened form of the virus and if we can harness the means by which these elite white blood cells stop the virus then we can hopefully teach or reprogram white blood cells in others to also target hiv
3316751 the presence of this genetic spot is a discordant result that strongly contradicts theories that various genetic factors alone play a protective role in suppression
3316752 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3316753 bahrains top down reforms initiated by king hamad bin isa al khalifa in 2001 were a welcome respite for a population weary of the violence and state repression that characterised much of the preceding decade

3316759 leveraged loans and unfunded commitments are difficult to hedge effectively and if market conditions further deteriorate additional markdowns may be necessary on this asset class

3316768 as enterprises become more dependent on the wan optimisation has become a necessity rather than a nice to have in todays economic conditions we have strived to make wan optimisation more affordable and will continue to take an aggressive approach to our product development strategy
3316769 not only are we staying ahead of the competition with our technology but are also pushing the development of the wan optimization market forward with our unique licensing model in order to achieve the price points and scalability required by organizations today
3316770 unlike other wan optimisation products on the market expands branch office accelerators only require a new license to scale from 128k up to 6mbps rather than a physical forklift upgrade from other vendors
3316771 an accelerator is not a short term solution communication is the lifeblood of any business and their requirements are constantly changing at expand we understand that organisations need the capability to adapt according to network and user demand in order to support changing business initiatives our goal is to ensure superior application performance to distributed business environments making the workforce and therefore the business more productive as it directors are increasingly looking to do more with less the enhanced scalability and measurable roi benefits of our branch office accelerators provide a compelling and future proof solution to managing business bandwidth in key it initiatives such as mobile communications virtualization and consolidation

3316774 mike mckenzie and kenny chesney are from opposite ends of the earth and yet here they are this one afternoon kenny is noticing that mike is wearing the same clothes hes been in all day from rehab and he knows that mckenzie wants to get in the shower
3316775 so somewhere about 7 30 or 8 at night and id love to see this chesney is undressing mckenzie to get him in the shower right before the lsu national championship game they went off and had dinner that night so im at the game and i get a phone call from chesney and mckenzie and im thinking of all people these two are together

3316779 as we believe there will be no further loss making quarter considering that the tainted assets have been drastically reduced there should also be no danger of a further capital increase
3316780 it might be that we keep or divest or enter into joint ventures or collaboration
3316781 for the time being there are no plans to divest
3316782 the long term trends for the travel industry remain positive

3316786 it looks like sentiment towards gold has turned negative were seeing long liquidation on the back of both dollarmovement and the oil price movement
3316787 despite best buys growth opportunities we think the sluggish macro environment and increased competition at retail will continue to weigh on results in both the short and long term
3316788 we are increasingly concerned by the competitive environment with discounters foray into providing services for the consumer
3316789 customer service and installation is one of best buys competitive advantages in a highly competitive and commoditized industry while wal mart and target have no where near the service level of best buy which includes home installation from magnolia and geek squad the fact that these companies are starting to offer installation in a difficult environment could result in a slow down in share gains or possibly even share loss for best buy
3316790 to win the fight against malaria we must attack the disease on many fronts
3316791 exxonmobil is committed to this battle which is why were doing everything we are from helping to develop new drugs facilitating the delivery of insecticide treated bed nets to places where they are desperately needed and supporting programs that prevent the spread of the disease
3316792 exxonmobil has been a corporate leader in the fight against malaria and we are delighted by their support for our work
3316793 this funding will greatly strengthen the pioneering malaria control and elimination efforts under way in southern africa and link them more effectively to similar work in other parts of the world
3316794 malaria knows no borders it cannot be eliminated in any one country unless we tackle it together

3316816 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3316817 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3316818 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3316819 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3316820 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3316821 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3316822 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3316823 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

3316845 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3316846 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3316847 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3316848 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3316849 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3316850 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3316851 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3316852 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3316853 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3316854 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3316855 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3316856 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3316857 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3316858 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3316859 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3316860 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3316861 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3316862 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3316863 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3316864 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3316865 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3316866 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3316867 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3316868 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3316869 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3316870 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3316871 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3316872 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3316873 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3316874 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3316875 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3316876 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3316877 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3316878 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3316879 gmail is having a systemwide outage affecting multiple countries and a whole bunch of its 100 million users are screaming about it on twitter around 20 million people visit gmail each day according to comscore and theyre all seeing the same message the first outages were reported at about 2 pm pst 44 minutes ago the gmail blog is silent on the outage instead giving readers some useful tips on customizing web clips
3316880 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3316881 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3316882 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3316883 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3316884 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3316885 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3316886 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3316887 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3316888 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3316889 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3316890 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3316891 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3316892 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3316893 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3316894 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3316895 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

3316993 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se

3317024 there is definitely no reason to own a laptop if you do not move it around it is an inferior computer to the desktop period
3317025 with all that upgrading you could have afforded a new laptop or desktop i dont see what special value there is in preserving your pc case when you replaced everything else inside
3317026 notebooks still dont stack up to advanced towers which makes them less ideal for those needing extremely high performance
3317027 2 things that are keeping laptops back are current hard drives and cooling
3317028 my laptop has been my primary computer id take it to school work with me then when i got back home id just plug in my monitor keyboard mouse speakers and keep on using it like it was a desktop
3317029 yes i know i can plug in an external usb keyboard but id rather not carry around a 2nd keyboard
3317030 god forbid my power cord gets chewed by my dog i can replace it anywhere because theyre standard power cords from power supplies where as with a laptop each laptop has it sown cord and if your laptop is a few years old good luck finding a cord
3317031 i have not used my desktop computer for over a year since i got my slightly better laptop the whole part where the computer is mobile sells it
3317032 ive been building pcs for about as many years and now am buying laptops instead the only need to have a desktop in this day and age is gaming but i now do most of my gaming on my ps3
3317033 if you have a little money buy a nice lcd when youre programming plug it into the laptop and guess what now its dual monitor and youre at full productivity unplug the monitor and you can take your work with you its the best of both worlds
3317034 laptops may be just as fast and have all the functionality of a desktop

3317045 its tougher to lose a good guy you know than the 40 home run guy
3317046 its going to be tough to replace his offense but its even tougher to replace the man
3317047 we kid and say hes as slippery as an eel
3317048 hes done better with each race hes been in were so proud of him
3317049 we get them as yearlings and theyve had very little human contact you have to earn their trust with a lot of love and patience
3317050 we allow them to just be horses for the first couple of years
3317051 what you do to them as babies makes them into the horse they become
3317052 you have to teach them their manners or they wont succeed with someone else
3317053 she likes to have things her way but fillies are harder to work with then males
3317054 you can tell he likes to win hes just a really nice colt
3317055 its not like thorough breeds where someone has to be experienced and trained to do certain jobs here just about anyone can train a horse for these races
3317056 i think its great when they win but its heartbreaking when one has potential and starts winning and then gets hurt or for some reason cant race anymore that hurts
3317057 this is what makes the fair the people and all the entries here in one of the oldest buildings its the tradition thats what makes it fun we like to see people take pride in what they do and its exciting when the ribbons are placed
3317058 ive been baking since i was really little i hope it will win we dont find out until around 3 p m today
3317059 the cakes you make a whole cake but the pies if you make anything larger than five inches it is disqualified and so you do mini pies the first thing they look at is the appearance then they cut it and then they taste it
3317060 i like to win best of show but i dont want to be greedy i entered different classes all the cake classes but white or yellow and some breads so well see how it goes
3317061 theyre going to taste 15 20 in each category anyone can enter so that makes it exciting
3317062 every year it gets bigger at first i just wanted to place a few things but then i just had to keep going
3317063 i started out with just a few roses and now look its very enjoyable and you develop a camaraderie you just see people that you dont get to see any other time its fun
3317064 we are down on entries a bit from last year some parts of the county got rain and some parts didnt it makes a big difference
3317065 as soon as they have that competed he will be ours
3317066 helen had heard her husband yelling in the other room so she went up to see what was going on and at that point she noticed the suspect had blood on himself and her husband had an injury
3317067 we dont want to jeopardize the sheriffs offices investigation or our own
3317068 we wanted to take these ideas and find practical applications for them
3317069 its about having a plan and building collaboration and partnerships among leaders in the district its important that we work together and i strongly believe the strengths of our region together will exceed the sum of its individual parts
3317070 i could not be more proud of the work our residents elected officials and industry experts put into this effort
3317071 this was an historic undertaking and i know the ideas we generated will play a significant part in ensuring our future economic growth
3317072 i think were trying to do something too soon im leery about putting another 1 1 million out there
3317073 id like to see us in a little better position before we go out for another 1 1 million
3317074 its fun you get to wreck people without getting the insurance involved
3317075 i like just getting to watch them beat each other up
3317076 its the only time you can tear up a vehicle and not get trouble
3317077 this aint about winning it gives the fans a rush
3317078 its a good show for the fans we like putting it on
3317079 i weld the doors add leaf springs and a good running motor and training
3317080 we have them out just in case someone gets hurt
3317081 cars still get flipped over and theres fires but its safer and it gets better every year
3317082 all these will help us theyre where we need to be thinking
3317083 we need to do more than ride a bicycle and wait until the wind blows itll take a while to get oil through the pipelines but the sooner we start the better off were going to be
3317084 you cant drill your way out of the problem you cant conserve your way out of the problem
3317085 if hes become more enlightened since hes come home and talked to his constituents good
3317086 the long term solution is to convert to alternative fuels

3317089 2018 hoge ave that was one of the better projects it was unbelievable what they were able to do there
3317090 there were a lot of different people here who all brought a lot of really good ideas that will help benefit everyone i think that there needs to be a lot of effort from a lot of people not just the governor
3317091 the mission of the schools is to ensure every child has the opportunity to succeed economically has the opportunity to become a well rounded person a productive citizen and to do that schools must create an environment that fosters opportunity and innovation
3317092 as we reflect on your mission its critical to focus on devotion to the whole child
3317093 this is the sixth of 12 meetings and thats the comment thats most consistently made that we need a system directed toward the betterment of the whole child
3317094 this is an opportunity for us to think boldly and transform our schools
3317095 people do feel passionate about the system and understand that we ought not to just try to fix what our perceived weaknesses are we need to think about what we ought to be doing
3317096 ive spent a great deal of my first year in office meeting with every educational stakeholder i could ive listened to their frustrations and what they think should be done this is an effort to more fully engage people at a grass roots level
3317097 how do we pay for it where do resources come from the early part of next year im going to put together a comprehensive package that will address reforms as well as funding issues
3317098 i dont know if ill be successful but im engaging myself in this process
3317099 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behavior
3317100 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3317101 i just dont understand it it tells me to use the force so i let go of the controls but i always crash

3317160 che cosa ha fatto di male quella donna per essere messa in una cella
3317161 e una indesiderata unemarginata una donna che forse vittima di una tratta e che cerca di vivere o sopravvivere con il proprio corpo e questo in una italia sempre pi intollerante diventata una colpa
3317162 essere poveri sta diventando un crimine e in questa fascia di nuovi perseguitati i pi deboli sono gli immigrati e le donne ci sono troppe lucciole che sono schiave e si vendono sui marciapiedi perch minacciate da chi le ha fatte arrivare in italia
3317163 le retate anti prostituzione continua servono solo a fare impazzire le lucciole che scappano da una citt allaltra o da un quartiere allaltro in cerca di un clima pi tollerante la ragazza fotografata chieder mai aiuto a chi lha trattenuta in quella cella si fider mai delle forze dellordine anche se vittima della tratta non glielo dir e se insieme alle sue colleghe sar cacciata in un cono dombra ancora maggiore ad esempio se sar costretta a prostituirsi in un appartamento non incontrer neppure volontari in grado di spiegargli che pu entrare in un percorso di protezione i sindaci sceriffo stanno cavalcando il tema della prostituzione ottenendo come unico effetto quello di criminalizzare chi avrebbe bisogno di protezione
3317164 trovo vergognoso continua corso riferendosi alla foto quel corpo abbandonato a terra in un comando di polizia municipale trovo vergognoso che i nostri poliziotti carabinieri e vigili urbani controllino gli immigrati senza informarli dei loro diritti e che si scambi la prostituzione per un problema di sicurezza
3317165 siamo scettici nei confronti delle ordinanze dei sindaci nati sulla scia della carta di parma e delle retate anti prostituzione le forze dellordine dovrebbero essere inviate in strada non a fare multe ma a capire i meccanismi che soggiacciono a certi fenomeni dovrebbero essere preparati per leggere i segnali capire se di fronte hanno donne vittime dello sfruttamento o meno sarebbe necessario guardare in faccia la realt e trovare soluzioni pragmatiche ad esempio zone in cui la prostituzione possa avvenire alla luce del sole invece di alimentare o cavalcare politicamente la percezione dinsicurezza dei cittadini
3317166 almeno voi clienti di parma siate onesti voi che siete sempre riusciti a eludere chiss come mai i controlli della municipale e dei carabinieri unitevi per aiutare le donne che stuprate comprategli un appartamento collettivo cos almeno il sindaco sar contento sotto il tappeto della malavita la polvere del degrado non si muove e parma risplender pi che mai

3317207 there were parts of the movie where i laughed but it seems to me that the movie tried really hard to go too far and then pull back on everything that was offensive except the issue of people with intellectual disabilities i just think ben stiller and the people involved in this movie just didnt think it was going to be offensive

3317215 we feel that the use of the word retard throughout the film 15 or more times is done without any regard for the dignity of people with intellectual disabilities

3317261 behold children are a gift of the lord the fruit of the womb is a reward
3317262 newly obtained documents prove that in 2003 barack obama as chairman of an illinois state senate committee voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
3317263 obama said that had he been in the u s senate two years ago he would have voted for the born alive infants protection act even though he voted against a state version of the proposal the difference between the state and federal versions obama explained was that the state measure lacked the federal language clarifying that the act would not be used to undermine roe vs wade the 1973 u s supreme court opinion that legalized abortion
3317264 senator obama says if he had been in the u s senate in 2002 he too would have voted in favor of the born alive infant protection act because unlike the illinois bill it included language protecting roe v wade

3317266 the perseid meteors are the debris of a comet that is now far away from the sun where it spends most of its life in the coldness of space however during the perseid shower the earth passes through the trail of dust debris that the comet left behind many years ago
3317267 when one of these dust particles is intercepted by our planet as it orbits the sun it causes the dust particle to completely burn up leaving an eye catching streak of light
3317268 perseid meteors appear to originate from the direction of the constellation perseus which rises in the northeast the best view is in this direction and far away from city lights onlookers should find a safe dark site such as a city or state park where oncoming vehicle headlights wont interfere

3317301 los bancos espa oles ven c mo su resistencia comienza a desvanecerse
3317302 el malestar econ mico amenaza con socavar la unidad europea
3317303 los bancos espa oles ven c mo su resistencia comienza a desvanecerse
3317304 es posible que el sistema bancario espa ol sea el siguiente en acusar los efectos del crack financiero mundial del mismo modo que sus colegas de estados unidos han sufrido una escalada de amortizaciones y han tenido que ir con el sombrero en la mano pidiendo inyecciones de capital los bancos espa oles hasta ahora se han mantenido sorprendentemente bien hecho que muchos analistas atribuyen a un sistema regulador que los oblig a guardar m s reservas durante pocas de bonanza pero con el estallido de la burbuja del sector inmobiliario afectando de lleno a los constructores a los propietarios de viviendas y a diversos sectores econ micos el panorama se est empa ando especialmente para las cajas de ahorros
3317305 la compa a moody s investors service recalc en un informe que el declive en el mercado inmobiliario pod a considerarse m s agudo de lo que se esperaba recortando dr sticamente su clasificaci n crediticia a cinco importantes cajas de ahorro espa olas tras a os de exagerada construcci n y de precios ascendentes el colapso del sector inmobiliario espa ol del a o pasado ha llevado la econom a espa ola al borde de la recesi n considerando muchos analistas la quiebra de la constructora m s importante de espa a martinsa fadesa como punto de inflexi n
3317306 en parte espa a se ha preparado para la desaceleraci n los vigilantes reguladores desalentaron la creaci n de activos al margen de balances que muchos bancos europeos y estadounidenses utilizaron para invertir arriesgadamente en valores inmobiliarios y lo que es m s importante continuando con el ciclo de boom inmobiliario de los a os 90 el banco de espa a instituy en el a o 2000 la necesidad de que los bancos acumularan importantes fondos para prever los d ficit por pr stamos de los a os de prosperidad y as poder absorber p rdidas en tiempos de vacas flacas gracias a este din mico aprovisionamiento de acuerdo con el banco de espa a los bancos espa oles disfrutan de un colch n equivalente a casi el 150 de los actuales pr stamos impagados
3317307 los expertos consideran que las cajas de ahorro son las entidades m s d biles porque tienen tendencia a ser menos rentables que otras entidades y se exponen m s arriesgadamente en el mercado inmobiliario
3317308 el malestar econ mico amenaza con socavar la unidad europea
3317309 en espa a la explosi n de la burbuja inmobiliaria ha hundido al pa s en una crisis al m s puro estilo americano con la ca da de los precios de la vivienda el incremento de la delincuencia y el aumento del paro los problemas de espa a subrayan un cambio de rumbo en la fortuna europea mientras que hace tan solo unos meses era considerada un pilar necesario para la fortaleza de una econom a mundial que ahora se ralentiza
3317310 la desaceleraci n econ mica en espa a tiene m s similitudes con la de estados unidos que las de alemania y francia algunos economistas afirman que la mejor receta para dar impulso a las econom as ser a la f rmula utilizada por la reserva federal bajar los tipos de inter s pero el banco central europeo ha tomado el camino contrario aumentando los tipos para controlar la inflaci n que algunos consideran la mayor amenaza para las principales econom as europeas
3317311 en espa a a finales de la a o pasado uno de cada cinco empleos estaba relacionado con los sectores inmobiliario y de la construcci n la tasa de desempleo cay del 25 de 1993 al 8 en 2008 pero el exceso de construcci n la desaceleraci n econ mica y el endurecimiento crediticio han dejado a espa a con un stock de viviendas equivalente a dos a os el desempleo ha aumentado por encima del 10 y la venta de viviendas ha ca do en mayo un 34 en comparaci n con el a o anterior

3317314 el pa s est relativamente bien preparado con un presupuesto s lido y bancos sanos
3317315 la mayor a de las econom as nacionales no est n bien preparadas para una crisis en las pocas buenas existe la tendencia a disfrutar del momento mientras dure pero espa a est en un buen estado en un triple sentido primero los presupuestos p blicos registran un plus en el a o 2006 alcanz el dos por ciento del pib segundo los bancos tienen balances relativamente s lidos tercero el endeudamiento ha crecido pero sigue siendo relativamente bajo as el gobierno tiene varias posibilidades para reaccionar a la crisis puede ayudar a ciudadanos con dificultades y puede compensar el retroceso del consumo y de inversiones privadas con gastos p blicos para la infraestructura espa a est mejor preparada que nunca pero el pa s ya no puede mejorar su competitividad a trav s de los tipos de cambio y a cambio tiene que adaptar sus precios y sus salarios esto es un proceso largo pero es m s que necesario
3317316 sonaron las alertas en espa a ante los indicadores que se alan que el pa s podr a entrar en recesi n como a la mayor a de las econom as del mundo la crisis financiera de estados unidos y el alza del precio del petr leo y de los alimentos afectaron directamente a la pen nsula el banco de espa a pronostic un crecimiento intertrimestral de 0 1 por ciento en el segundo trimestre a una tasa interanual de 1 8 por ciento por ahora con los sectores de la construcci n y del consumo en fuerte crisis los espa oles comenzaron a sentir los efectos
3317317 la situaci n econ mica de espa a no es aislada en europa otras econom as que se mostraban fuertes hasta hace poco han sufrido los coletazos de la crisis mundial en un escenario de desaceleraci n y de aumento de la inflaci n los ndices de confianza en francia y alemania han mostrado una severa baja en italia el pa s m s afectado y con una enorme deuda p blica el crecimiento del segundo trimestre fue cero respecto de igual per odo de 2007 y se redujo en 0 3 por ciento en relaci n con el primer trimestre
3317318 el gobierno de jos luis rodr guez zapatero intenta enfrentar calmadamente este escenario econ mico pero ya lo golpe de modo directo en su popularidad su partido el psoe cay m s de cuatro puntos en las encuestas y se ubic en empate con su rival el partido popular

3317325 georgia se granjea un amplio apoyo en la guerra informativa
3317326 el campo de batalla del conflicto georgiano osetio cada vez se ampl a m s una verdadera guerra informativa se ha desatado en el consejo de seguridad de la onu y en los medios de comunicaci n mundiales la mayor a de los medios critica el bombardeo georgiano de tsijinvali y la respuesta asim trica de rusia incluyendo el bombardeo de la ciudad de gori y la entrada de tropas en osetia del sur seg n el washington post tradicionalmente cercano a la posici n oficial de los ee uu georgia ha respondido a los numerosos ataques provocativos de los separatistas sur osetios subrayando que tbilisi no quer a esta guerra el peri dico espa ol el pa s ha calificado la decisi n de georgia de introducir tropas en tsijinvali de tr gica y err nea si bien es cierto que los analistas espa oles sacan conclusiones an logas rusia estar a intentado ganar puntos pol ticos en el conflicto
3317327 las acciones militares a n contin an pero las partes ya han conseguido sus objetivos
3317328 el contingente ruso ha concluido una parte importante de la operaci n para obligar a la parte georgiana a que tome el camino de la paz declar ayer el presidente de rusia dmitri medvedev el ataque de nuestras tropas en territorio de otro estado es calificado por los expertos militares patrios de intervenci n humanitaria los pa ses occidentales prefieren hablar de una agresi n que rusia est llevando a cabo contra georgia ni unos ni otros llevan raz n ayer el presidente georgiano mijail saakashvili firm un documento de alto el fuego en presencia del jefe del mae franc s bernard kouchner y del jefe de la osce el finland s alexander stubb sin embargo seg n datos rusos parte de las tropas georgianas continuaron abriendo fuego contra las posiciones de los soldados rusos de pacificaci n y contra las afueras de la capital de osetia del sur tsijinvali
3317329 es indudable que rusia ha demostrado en los ltimos d as su potencial b lico y pol tico en la situaci n en osetia estamos actuando como estados unidos que siempre defiende a sus ciudadanos por cualquier medio noventa mil rusos que viven en la georgiana osetia del sur han pedido que se les defienda
3317330 hoy llega a mosc nicol s sarkozy procedente de tbilisi a mosc no le satisfacen otros mediadores las condiciones de la ue son el cese del fuego la salida de tropas y el respeto de la integridad territorial de georgia en v speras de la llegada a mosc de nicol s sarkozy a mosc otro aterrizaje europeo tuvo lugar en georgia el jefe del mae franc s bernard kouchner y el presidente de turno de la osce alexander stubb visitaron gori donde se les mostr la ciudad destruida a causa de los bombardeos rusos a tsijinvali claro est no les han trasladado
3317331 la guerra en osetia del sur se ha convertido en el principal acontecimiento televisivo de la semana pasada ayer aparecieron los primeros datos de tns gallup media los cuales se alan que desde el viernes la atenci n de la mayor a de los telespectadores rusos est centrada en los programas informativos el ndice de audiencia de los programas informativos ha crecido entre dos y tres veces el inter s por las pel culas seriales y juegos ol mpicos de pek n ha quedado en un segundo plano
3317332 qui n fue el primero en echar le a al fuego
3317333 karel de gucht siempre hubo tensiones y resulta dif cil determinar con exactitud lo ocurrido pero todo apunta a que saakachvili tom la iniciativa para intentar recuperar osetia del sur
3317334 de gucht todo ello tendr una influencia resulta cada vez m s claro que los rusos no aceptan que georgia y ucrania se conviertan en miembros de la otan es una de sus l neas rojas su segunda l nea roja que la situaci n en osetia del sur se mantenga como estaba esta segunda l nea roja ha sido vulnerada por consiguiente me temo que los rusos se muestren muy poco dispuestos a aceptar una mediaci n putin sostiene que este tema es un asunto ruso que no requiere mediaci n ya que ellos saben perfectamente lo que pueden y quieren hacer
3317335 el gobierno georgiano aspiraba a solucionar el conflicto con un golpe de mano si lo hubiera conseguido un macizo dif cilmente superable separar a ahora a rusia de osetia del sur tras numerosas declaraciones de solidaridad del presidente estadounidense bush saakaschwili contaba inocentemente con el apoyo directo de ee uu la c pula rusa por su parte parece que estaba esperando el golpe las tropas rusas seguramente llegar n hasta el pipeline que atraviesa georgia las condiciones para su liberaci n ser n acuerdos que bloquear n la integraci n de georgia en occidente
3317336 es el momento de indignarse ante la brutalidad rusa en el c ucaso no hay duda pero la indignaci n no sustituye a la pol tica la pol tica es el arte de lo posible y pocas veces esta frase suena tan amarga y al mismo tiempo tan necesaria la condici n fundamental para una actuaci n de este tipo es la percepci n de la realidad y uno de los hechos es que la imposici n del derecho de autodeterminaci n nacional no aumenta la estabilidad internacional si los grandes y peque os miembros de la comunidad de estados persiguen sus objetivos sin tener en cuenta a los dem s dif cilmente se puede garantizar una desarrollo pac fico
3317337 mosc ha de dejar de portarse como una potencia decimon nica
3317338 rusia que en este conflicto est evidentemente dirigida por vladimir putin m s que por dimitri medvedev su sucesor en la presidencia ha de considerar con sumo cuidado c mo dejar esta acci n completamente desproporcionada la posici n mundial de rusia puede que mijail saakashvili el presidente georgiano metiese la pata hasta el fondo al pensar que podr a recuperar al control de osetia del sur perdido en 1992 despu s de que la ruptura de la uni n sovi tica condujese a la fragmentaci n de algunas de sus antiguas rep blicas podr a ser como afirma que tiflis estaba respondiendo a las provocaciones de los aliados de rusia en la provincia rebelde en cualquier caso cometi un error de c lculo
3317339 no obstante y aunque saakshvili pareciese temerario la respuesta de mosc empleando fuerzas enormemente superiores no s lo para sacar a las tropas georgianas de la capital surosetia de tsjinvali sino tambi n para machacar objetivos civiles y militares en la propia georgia hace que putin y medvedev parezcan matones en tan mort fero y lamentable asunto
3317340 cuatro d as de silencio condenan a gran breta a
3317341 a las 3 45 de la tarde de ayer downing street hizo p blico unas declaraciones en nombre de gordon brown en las que condenaba las acciones de rusia en georgia y ped a a mosc que accediera a un alto el fuego para evitar una cat strofe humanitaria en el c ucaso por qu ha tardado el primer ministro cuatro d as en expresarse en estos t rminos d nde est el ministro de asuntos exteriores brown y miliband han dejado que sarkozy bush y otras figuras mundiales lideraran la condena mientras atenuaban la respuesta brit nica dice mucho sobre la percepci n del gobierno de la influencia brit nica en los asuntos mundiales el que est dispuesto a dejar sus reacciones a la uni n europea
3317342 la l nea oficial de mosc es que la acci n militar de rusia contra georgia pretende restaurar la paz en el disputado territorio de osetia del sur y proteger a la poblaci n local contra los ataques georgianos pero ning n analista militar en mosc o fuera cree que en realidad sea tan limitado muchos analistas rusos est n de acuerdo en que el conflicto pretende reinstaurar la autoridad rusa en el c ucaso asegurar que georgia nunca se una a la otan y enviar se ales claras a otros como ucrania de que no sue en con hacerlo
3317343 esta provincia osetia del sur al igual que las dem s que putin quiere quitar a georgia s lo son pretextos para mostrar su voluntad de potencia putin desde chechenia hasta hoy en georgia nunca ha disimulado su voluntad de recurrir a las amenazas y a la fuerza si fuera necesario para restablecer la potencia perdida sabe aprovecharse con arte de las debilidades y divisiones de occidente por esta raz n puede que el viaje de nicolas sarkozy a tbilissi y a mosc sea el viaje el m s importante desde el inicio de su mandato puede aceptar el presidente franc s y con l la europa a la que representa que rusia invada un pa s soberano por primera vez desde checoslovaquia y afganist n puede hacer que georgia acepte un acuerdo leonino que de hecho ratifica la situaci n en el terreno lo que est en juego en osetia del sur no es microsc pico seg n el desafortunado t rmino empleado por su ministro de asuntos exteriores
3317344 nadie est libre de culpa en la peligrosa partida que se ha transformado en una mort fera guerra en el c ucaso no se pueden imaginar excusas para la invasi n rusa de georgia tras golpear objetivos tanto militares como civiles con bombarderos estrat gicos y misiles los veh culos blindados rusos entraron el lunes en georgia suscitando el temor de un asalto en toda regla de la capital y sobre el gobierno democr ticamente elegido de saakashvili mosc sostiene que est limit ndose a defender los derechos de las minor as tnicas de osetia del sur y abjasia que est n tratando de separarse de georgia desde principios de los noventa sin embargo sus ambiciones van mucho m s all estados unidos y sus aliados europeos han de decir a putin en los t rminos m s claros posibles que no se tolerar tal agresi n y no habr otra divisi n de europa
3317345 dada la riqueza petrolera rusa y su arsenal nuclear la influencia occidental est limitada pero no es intrascendente rusia quiere respeto acuerdos econ micos y un sitio en la mesa incluyendo el ingreso en la organizaci n mundial del comercio as como un nuevo acuerdo de cooperaci n pol tica y econ mica con la uni n europea mosc tambi n est ansioso por un acuerdo de cooperaci n nuclear con ee uu por valor de miles de millones
3317346 la semana pasada el presidente del bce jean claude trichet por fin se mostr p blicamente preocupado ante el riesgo que pesa actualmente sobre el crecimiento europeo los mercados financieros han cre do ver en ello un cambio en su discurso hasta ahora exclusivamente centrado en la inflaci n algunos han concluido que pod amos esperar que finalizase el ciclo de aumento de los tipos de inter s europeos que acaban de subir a principios del mes de julio los m s temerarios incluso sue an con un descenso algo que evidentemente supondr a una bocanada de aire fresco muy bien acogida la direcci n que siga depender tambi n de las pol ticas implantadas por los bancos centrales y de sus discursos
3317347 lo han dicho los medios de comunicaci n los electores y hasta los observadores qui n m s tiene que decirlo el presidente venezolano hugo ch vez el di logo y la concertaci n est n ahora en manos del gobierno contra viento y marea se ha llevado a efecto el cuestionable refer ndum revocatorio cuyos resultados han dejado satisfechos a unos y otros porque no s lo ganaron sino que salieron fortalecidos la pregunta que se impone ahora adosada de incertidumbre con m s temores que esperanzas es qu viene despu s en los 30 meses del gobierno de evo morales se ha hablado mucho del di logo pero ste nunca se tradujo en concertaciones ni en un apaciguamiento de las tensiones m s bien ocurri todo lo contrario se agravaron las diferencias y las acritudes
3317348 a la luz de estas posiciones luego de corroborarse lo que desde este mismo espacio hemos advertido por meses que el revocatorio no resolver a ni un pice de la crisis pol tica nacional es conveniente pensar en lo que sobrevendr otros referendos m s revocatorios en fin nuevas convocatorias a las urnas hasta cu ndo el soberano tendr que hacerse cargo de los errores de los l deres pol ticos del pa s la responsabilidad de lo que vaya a ocurrir no es de la ciudadan a si bien el pueblo es el soberano no le corresponde resolver las crisis cada vez que los pol ticos se ven entre las cuerdas
3317349 morales gana referendo y sube su apoyo pero se agudiza divisi n regional

3317386 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3317387 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3317388 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3317389 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model

3317425 id leaks a surprising source is your government at work
3317426 only a small portion of data breaches get publicized and with government data breaches even fewer get identified because the government unlike business doesnt have a financial incentive to do so
3317427 its very important that the government view citizens as their customers and place more value on sensitive information
3317428 he finds markets for small diameter material cull trees and shortleaf pine materials that many other logging crews would not be interested in he has made them profitable
3317429 efficient utilization allows larry to give private forest owners higher bids for low quality timber
3317430 when he is done they dont have to hire someone else to come in and do timber stand improvement cuts remove slash and generally clean up after him that makes landowners more likely to manage their forest land keeping it at maximum productivity and they tell other landowners about their experience making others more likely to actively manage their forests larry and david are walking recommendations for good forest management
3317431 when larry and david are on the job my work supervising timber sales is minimal
3317432 they complete most of the clean up work as they do the job spring poles dangerously bent tree trunks are cut and skid trails and log landings are located in the most efficient manner possible the landings are so thoroughly cleared of woody debris that at least one landowner has used them to plant food plots many private landowners have commented on the lack of residual tree damage after the harvest is over his work sites are just unbelievably clean
3317433 for a private landowner looking for a quality logging job larry is the first logger i suggest to conduct the sale
3317434 he may not be able to pay as high for stumpage as other larger logging operations but the quality job you will receive will be more beneficial in the long run and result in greater customer satisfaction
3317435 that job was small by most standards but its importance far exceeds its size
3317436 the stands harvested by danny represent different silviculture prescriptions that will be used as interpretive areas for an educational hiking trail as well as for programs presented at twin pines few other parcels of state land will receive greater scrutiny than this area danny understood this responsibility and accepted the job knowing that the conservation department was looking for the perfect logging job and he succeeded

3317440 despite overwhelming evidence of rab and police responsibility for unlawful killings the interim bangladeshi government seems unwilling to address the problem
3317441 instead bangladeshs security forces continue to get away with murder
3317442 the officials responsible for killing moshiul alam sentu and others should be prosecuted and punished to the full extent of the law
3317443 unless those officers involved are held to account regardless of rank the rab will continue to torture and murder
3317444 the rule of law cant become a reality in bangladesh unless the very forces tasked with upholding the law are also bound by it

3317446 age adjusted death rates have reached record lows and life expectancy has reached record highs in recent years likely due to a combination of behavior and societal changes as well as improved medical and surgical therapies
3317447 with the rise in life expectancy it becomes necessary to focus on improving the quality of life and functional abilities as people reach older ages regular exercise including running may contribute to improved health among older adults
3317448 the higher levels among controls translate into important differences in overall daily functional limitations
3317449 disability and survival curves continued to diverge between groups after the 21 year follow up as participants approached their ninth decade of life
3317450 our findings of decreased disability in addition to prolonged survival among middle aged and older adults participating in routine physical activities further support recommendations to encourage moderate to vigorous physical activity at all ages
3317451 increasing healthy lifestyle behaviors may not only improve length and quality of life but also hopefully lead to reduced health care expenditures associated with disability and chronic diseases

3317456 if an employee does work at home i would think that some organizational resources would be provided
3317457 i know from teaching managers and other employees that even away from work many are still on company time they just dont stop working
3317458 if employees are in that kind of job where theyre working at home and while theyre traveling the institution needs to take the burden of choice off employees taking a ream of paper home and wondering if you have to be sneaky about it is not good for the employee and it is not good for morale id put it to the managers to work that out with employees and have an open discussion and an open understanding
3317459 i do think that the organization would want to have more accountability the higher the price tag of the item
3317460 i think its up to the organization to have a policy and then for the employees to know that policy
3317461 the idea of the center is not only to help sailors and marines in distress but to promote good stress management and promote psychological health so it starts when people come into boot camp and lasts all of the way until they graduate from war college
3317462 the idea is that we get past the concept of just dealing with things when they are in crisis and hopefully promote a system of addressing stress and addressing our ability to cope with it so we rarely get into a crisis mode
3317463 one of the things that i like to look at when people are training and they go through drills is how can we incorporate stress training into that so that they are more aware of when they are dealing with stress
3317464 when we talk about operational stress were talking about that unique set of circumstances that people have when they are deployed or when they are in the jobs that they do
3317465 for example somebody who works on the deck of an aircraft carrier has a much different level of stress than someone who is a civilian and works in an office building downtown
3317466 combat stress of course is the stress that occurs when you are in combat the extreme set of circumstances when your life is in danger and when you have to make life and death decisions quickly and when you are under extreme pressure
3317467 the center has four major divisions knowledge management programs research facilitation and strategic communications
3317468 het is erg opvallend dat jongeren nog zo traditioneel hun keuzes maken voor financi le producten dat is wel het laatste dat we hadden verwacht
3317469 onze verwachting was ook dat bankkantoren nog voornamelijk voor ouderen in stand gehouden worden en uit het straatbeeld gaan verdwijnen dat is niet zo
3317470 dat zijn voornamelijk de grote ketens als de hypotheker en de hypotheekshop hypotheken sluit je niet online af de 1 procent afsluitingen via internet betreft vooral tweede hypotheken voor kleine bedragen voor bijvoorbeeld een verbouwing
3317471 meer en meer zie je de belangrijke rol van experts op bijvoorbeeld hyves vaak via aanbevelingen van vrienden of via vrienden van vrienden
3317472 zon 60 procent van de jongeren kiest voor dezelfde bank of maatschappij als de ouders de generatiehypotheek is al een bekend verschijnsel maar er is meer te doen banken en verzekeraars bieden nu pakketkortingen per persoon maar dat kunnen ze ook per gezin gaan doen
3317473 this is an accident and we expect to follow appropriate procedures under international rules
3317474 it was inventive on his part ill give him that
3317475 we are seeing utter destitution we see malnutrition we are seeing depression we see homelessness people are coming to us from a place of crisis
3317476 there are still a number of people in the community who came out during world youth day there is certainly an expectation that some will decide to seek asylum rather that return

3317480 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3317481 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3317482 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3317483 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3317484 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales
3317485 de mantenerse esta l gica lo m s probable es que vamos a cosechar desgracias
3317486 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3317487 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3317488 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3317489 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3317490 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3317491 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3317492 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3317493 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

3317497 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
3317498 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
3317499 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
3317500 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
3317501 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
3317502 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
3317503 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad

3317507 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
3317508 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
3317509 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
3317510 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces

3317669 geht hinaus und schauet ihr t chter zions auf den k nig schlomo in der krone mit der ihn seine mutter gekr nt hat am tage seiner hochzeit und am tage der freude seines herzens
3317670 am tage seiner hochzeit das ist der tag der offenbarung der tora und am tage der freude seines herzens das ist die wiedererbauung des heiligtums m ge es bald in unseren tagen errichtet werden amen
3317671 wie bedeutungsvoll diese beiden tage gerade nach der definition von reinheit und heiligkeit waren denn an allen anderen festlichen tagen pflegten rabbinische abgesandte zu den pl tzen zu reisen an denen die leute sich versammelten um dort scharf darauf zu achten dass jedes leichtsinnige gebaren zwischen m nnern und frauen verh tet wurde aber an diesen beiden feiertagen war das nicht n tig denn an ihnen war ganz israel ohnehin darauf bedacht von sich aus und von selbst sich an die begrenzungen von reinheit anstand und heiligkeit zu halten weil die heiligkeit dieser beiden tage in so berragender weise sich auf sie einpr gte
3317672 dass jenes hinausgehen der t chter jerusalems einzig eine angelegenheit von heiligkeit gewesen ist und so ist gleichfalls unverkennbar dass es berhaupt nicht ihre absicht war ihre physischen vorz ge wie sch nheit oder reichtum zur schau zu stellen sondern lediglich jene vorz ge die auf dem boden von tora sich als wahrster und bester grund f r verlobung und heirat erweisen

3317685 moscow has repeatedly demanded that jerusalem halt its military assistance to georgia finally threatening a crisis in bilateral relations israel responded by saying that the only assistance rendered to tbilisi was defensive
3317686 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azerbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israels oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean

3317691 with the export sector accounting for 11 of total jobs and 12 of fixed asset investment there could be an additional impact on overall domestic demand growth
3317692 they were triggered by both rising demand and surging costs and influenced by domestic and global factors
3317693 although the major driver of the price rise remains rapidly expanding food costs we should take notice of rising producer prices and the pressure of imported inflation brought by increasing costs in the global market
3317694 there should be a bigger effect on a smaller economy than on a larger one
3317695 the impact of the 2008 olympics on chinas growth should be among the smallest as chinas economic size is one of the largest

3317700 thaksin has no reasonable grounds to say that the trial will not be fair his wifes case proved it
3317701 it is now the duty of the public prosecutor to extradite thaksin under that extradition treaty
3317702 thaksin seems to have made the right decision for himself it is better for him to live abroad with all his riches than live in a thai prison
3317703 it may not be easy for him to return to politics in the future because there may be more verdicts against him and there will be the arrest warrants
3317704 it is so extraordinary because these are cases against such a high profile family there has never been a case of this scale in the country
3317705 all emerging trends show that the phase of consensus and cooperation has ended

3317714 baklava is turkish we will not allow the greek cypriots to feed it to the world
3317715 feta cheese can only be the creation of greece and any other cheese that remotely resembles this delightful fare is really only an imitation and cannot be called anything other than white cheese
3317716 if you know anything about food then youll know that yoghurt was without a doubt invented cooked up made produced however you want to call it from turkey forget what anyone else tells you its an original turkish food product and always will be of course thats not to say that greek style yoghurt or french style yoghurt isnt original but notice the clever use of words lets make sure that we all understand its just a variation on an old tried and tested turkish recipe
3317717 there are some food items that sit on a fence cross a very fine line and can cause nations to come to blows over their ownership
3317718 cyprus an island with a troubled history and full of fascinating stories has a culinary culture not unlike a vast fruit bowl it is extremely colorful and tasty with recipes originating from far and wide the food derives from a blend of the middle east greece turkey italy and africa
3317719 the food of cyprus cannot be laid bare for one nation or another to lay a claim on in fact this is a cuisine that mixes old and new and what makes it truly unique is the fact that the recipes are available in both greek turkish and english
3317720 our us senate along with obama and mccain protects the interests of 20 million illegal aliens that take jobs from american citizens has either man stepped up to stop 400 000 annual illegal alien anchor babies and their mothers from sucking out of the us taxpayers pocket even while 86 hospitals in california and arizona are bankrupted out of existence because of millions of illegals using services for free
3317721 our economy is based on parasitic capitalism where the small elite sits atop the heap of men and gorges on their lifeblood

3317725 and will yield a result similar to what the old soviet union got when they tried that same silly crap ssc
3317726 one financial armageddon is entirely easily predictable the bankruptcy of government in the usa at every level federal state county and city the prediction follows from very simple mathematics entitlements which grow at 8 a year cannot be supported by an economy which grows at 3 or less

3317759 it was an opportunity to go over to china and do something that has probably not been done in the past go to china and do some comedy
3317760 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
3317761 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3317762 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3317763 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
3317764 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing
3317765 jon always has a very good sense of whats in good taste and bad
3317766 and well try to stay within the bounds of what we think is good taste we didnt go in there to make fun of the chinese people at all
3317767 i think our party has to concentrate on the economy
3317768 i would like the liberal democrats to concentrate very strongly on making sure weve got solutions for scotland on the issues that confront families individuals and businesses at this really tough time in our economic circumstances
3317769 im offering the liberal democrats and im offering the people of scotland through them control of our own affairs within the united kingdom
3317770 the biggest job for the new leader is to use the personality of the leader and also the persuasion of the leader to tell the people of scotland that liberal democrat policies and liberal democrat values are relevant to them
3317771 some men change their party for the sake of their principles others their principles for the sake of their party
3317772 the means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home
3317773 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder
3317774 a people that values its privileges above its principles soon loses both
3317775 a democracy will continue to exist up until the time that voters discover they can vote themselves generous gifts from the public treasury
3317776 we are not blind we are men and women with eyes and brains and we dont have to be driven hither and thither by the blind workings of the market or of history or of progress or of any other abstraction
3317777 this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it
3317778 a cynical mercenary demagogic press will produce in time a people as base as itself
3317779 the minute you read something that you cant understand you can almost be sure that it was drawn up by a lawyer
3317780 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
3317781 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
3317782 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
3317783 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
3317784 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
3317785 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
3317786 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds
3317787 when people who are honestly mistaken learn the truth they will either cease being mistaken or cease being honest
3317788 during times of universal deceit telling the truth becomes a revolutionary act
3317789 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves
3317790 the things that will destroy america are prosperity at any price peace at any price safety first instead of duty first the love of soft living and the get rich quick theory of life
3317791 democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch liberty is a well armed lamb contesting the vote
3317792 whoever controls the volume of money in any country is absolute master of all industry and commerce
3317793 if tyranny and oppression come to this land it will be in the guise of fighting a foreign enemy
3317794 the tyrant grinds down his slaves and they dont turn against him they crush those beneath them
3317795 patriotism is the conviction that your country is superior to all others because you were born in it
3317796 freedom is the right to tell people what they do not want to hear
3317797 anyone who believes exponential growth can go on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an economist
3317798 fascism should more appropriately be called corporatism because it is the merger of state and corporate power
3317799 corporation n an ingenious device for obtaining profit without individual responsibility
3317800 the hottest places in hell are reserved for those who in time of great moral crises maintain their neutrality
3317801 we are at the parting of the ways we have not one or two or three but many established and formidable monopolies in the united states we have not one or two but many fields of endeavor into which it is difficult if not impossible for the independent man to enter we have restricted credit we have restricted opportunity we have controlled development and we have come to be one of the worst ruled one of the most completely controlled and dominated governments in the civilized world no longer a government by free opinion no longer a government by conviction and the vote of the majority but a government by the opinion and the duress of small groups of dominant men
3317802 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
3317803 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
3317804 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
3317805 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all
3317806 so you think that money is the root of all evil have you ever asked what is the root of all money
3317807 we shall have world government whether or not we like it the only question is whether world government will be achieved by conquest or consent
3317808 if we dont change our direction were likely to end up where were headed
3317809 there are a lot of exiles in this world each one has his own reason we have ours long before we left america the america we knew left us we travel not to get away from it but to find it
3317810 while each of us is entitled to his own opinions none of us is entitled to his own facts
3317811 find out just what the people will submit to and you have found out the exact amount of injustice and wrong which will be imposed upon them and these will continue until they are resisted with either words or blows or with both the limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of those whom they oppress
3317812 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
3317813 a morsel of genuine history is a thing so rare as to be always valuable
3317814 any intelligent fool can make things bigger more complex and more violent it takes a touch of genius and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction
3317815 in the beginning of change the patriot is a scarce man and brave and hated and scorned when his cause succeeds the timid join him for it then costs nothing to be a patriot
3317816 the first step in the evolution of ethics is a sense of solidarity with other human beings
3317817 the human race has improved everything except the human race adlai stephenson
3317818 earth provides enough to satisfy every mans need but not every mans greed
3317819 if you tremble indignation at every injustice then you are a comrade of mine

3317821 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3317822 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3317823 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a significant and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3317824 these actions would be inconsistent with assurance that we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began
3317825 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3317826 please wake up everybody and please make your position and speak with a united voice
3317827 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3317828 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3317829 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3317830 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3317831 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3317832 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3317833 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3317834 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3317835 i did a five album deal and i dont think it would be right to be making streets albums after that i always envisaged them as a box set and ive got a vision for each of the albums
3317836 are confident that rockefeller is christian gerhartsreiter and the person named christopher chichester who was living in the los angeles area in 1985
3317837 one thing we are certain of this defendants true name is not clark rockefeller
3317838 schools efforts mean that they are sustaining the significant improvements of the last decade there are far fewer children below the expected level than 10 years ago and the brightest pupils are continuing to show good results particularly in maths
3317839 key stage 3 is an important stepping stone to success at further study and life beyond the classroom
3317840 it is encouraging that most pupils are achieving at or above the expected standard for their age in all three subjects and almost a third are now achieving the highest levels in maths
3317841 but i am disappointed by the slight drops in english and science reversing the rises of last year

3317861 there are many young strong single people in the athletes village and like everywhere some will fall in love or other things so we need to make condoms available
3317862 a lot of these young people are not married or in relationships so we want to make sure they have the information and tools to protect themselves if they have sexual encounters
3317863 we have people here from all religions and cultural backgrounds some of whom may feel uncomfortable or offended with condoms in their room
3317864 no one can see that you are carrying condoms to save any embarrassment
3317865 people are encouraged to take the leaflets and to take as many as they like they can use them or take them home for friends and spread the knowledge and awareness

3317884 low vitamin d levels seem to confer an increased risk of dying from any cause
3317885 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes

3317889 in a lot of instances we have this picture of private security as blackwater types ex navy seals but a lot of the contracts in afghanistan as i understand them are with local afghan companies
3317890 what youre really concerned about here is whos got guns and where they are
3317891 dnd should have a single point to co ordinate all of the dnd let contracts and it should probably be the same person who is co ordinating all government of canada let contracts in afghanistan
3317892 private security contractors are used for defensive roles primarily such as perimeter security at designated sites
3317893 clearly state that any use of force must be in accordance with applicable law

3317897 it is scandalous that hundreds of thousands of older people may be denied treatment because depression is wrongly seen as a natural part of getting older
3317898 older people deserve better treatment there should be no excuse for inaction
3317899 general practitioners have a key role to play in more effectively pinpointing possible depression as patients present themselves

3317905 as of monday gasoline prices in the u s fell by 7 1 cents or 1 9 per cent to a national average s 3 809 a gallon a three month low
3317906 however gasoline at the pump still averaged 82 3 cents above last years pace
3317907 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3317908 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3317909 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3317910 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3317911 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3317929 we are concerned that there is a great deal of external inspiration and support we are also concerned and are looking at a mastermind within the country

3317979 it is not a one on one matter i was made chief minister by all the allies of the upa and any decision on it should be taken by the coalition
3317980 besides the upas central leadership other mlas and ministers will have to sit together to reach a conclusion

3317986 the corporate pipeline is still strong which will lead growth we expect to maintain a 15 16 per cent year on year credit growth
3317987 it is too early to talk about softening of interest rates
3317988 we will invest up to 30 million euros in doubling the capacity of api manufacturing facility of dabur pharma located in kolkata and also in getting regulatory approvals for newly built formulation plant in baddi
3317989 dabur pharma with its strong product line in oncology segment is a perfect match for our european business
3317990 you cannot ask a rahul dravid sachin tendulkar sourav ganguly vvs laxman or anil kumble to prove their credentials
3317991 i think you should ask the selectors and the bcci this question i am happy with whatever they have in mind
3317992 i think it is just with time we should start winning in odis consistently we are a great team and we start doing well pretty soon
3317993 australia as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one
3317994 everyone has to improve we have got good bowlers in the side and they are doing their best
3317995 not at all a player can be good in odis and tests and 20 20 as well look at virender sehwag or gautam gambhir
3317996 well i am a person who goes and thinks by my heart i do whatever my heart tells me to do i am not sure what man management is the team is like my own family i treat them the way a person will treat his own family
3317997 i think my team members were obviously there behind me other than that my family and friends are always behind me
3317998 i will play the way the team requires me to play and i will come onto bat whenever the team requires me to do so it is not an experiment
3317999 there is irfan pathan who is doing quite well i am sure players like praveen kumar piyush chawla and others will come off age virender sehwag is bowling really well
3318000 we have a good 11 and our bench strength is also not that bad in fact we have to leave out world class bowlers like r p singh or piyush chawla from a team also batsmen like robin uthappa manoj tiwary does not find a place in the 11 this certainly shows that we have a good amount of support players
3318001 i feel we should play according to our strengths neither has australia or england or south africa changed their pitches for us so i dont see any reason why should we change our pitches
3318002 we have diversified our cpo market therefore the products are best selling throughout importing countries such as india pakistan latin american countries
3318003 we hope that there wont be any discrimination for indonesian products
3318004 it is higher than two years ago which reached 16 percents only but all depends on the local consumption too
3318005 lawson was not happy with the insistence of the selectors to have shahid afridi in the squad who has not played since the asia cup due to a wrist injury and personal problems
3318006 they were also some disputes over the selection of other players as well and after a exchange of hot words lawson left the academy in a huff after confirming a flight to sydney
3318007 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3318008 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3318009 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3318010 there is an urgent need to foster innovation as the world is inching closer to the goal of eradicating dreadful diseases especially for the early childhood by providing effective vaccines
3318011 we had been through a lot over the last eight years we put so much effort into this competition

3318023 following a course that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
3318024 the undermining of the sovereignty of a small democratic neighbouring state through the use of violence
3318025 georgia is to an extent the finland of today both morally and strategically
3318026 reincorporate old soviet areas into the kremlins sphere of control
3318027 if georgia no longer has its sovereignty it means not only that the west is cut off from the caspian sea and central asia but we can also assume that putin will exercise a similar strategy against ukraine if he faces resistance hes already publicly voiced threats against ukraine
3318028 if russia continues on this path it has to be isolated by the international community
3318029 first when bush met putin for the first time and said he had looked into his soul and could trust him secondly when condi rice not so long ago said that the american russian relations had never been better than they are today
3318030 he medvedev has about as much influence over the current situation as the official head of state in the soviet union of the 1950s had over the soviet union nobody can even remember his name

3318034 that both broadcast and online tv platforms are growing simultaneously underlines how they fulfil different needs for viewers and that they can co exist and indeed promote each other
3318035 first of all in terms of the amount of money spent by advertisers it is so small that it doesnt divert from broadcast tv money
3318036 this is a shaft of very bright light that cuts through any economic gloom advertisers should be taking advantage of a medium that offers proven effectiveness increasing value and is growing
3318037 i ended up fourth but actually i was aiming to get a gold
3318038 i really didnt know where i was then its difficult to correct them afterwards unless you know where you went wrong
3318039 i am happy to realize my olympic medal dream in my own country
3318040 the worst moment in the final was when the chinese levelled with me but luckily i was able to break away
3318041 hes four years old before i left he asked me to compete win and bring home a medal im training a lot and i dont get to see my family much
3318042 when he was alone he trained really hard but he has no one to compare with

3318049 kita terima hakikat bahawa pas memperjuangkan pembangunan islam dan hakikat ini kita dapat sesuaikan dengan pembangunan negeri kita
3318050 rakan kita dalam dap pula memperjuangkan rakyat keseluruhannya dan ini pakatan merupakan platform bersama
3318051 dan saya rasa ucapan tuan guru abdul hadi itu menegaskan perlunya masyarakat malaysia menerima perjuangan mereka untuk memperjuangkan agama islam dan ummah sebagai salah satu perjuangan yang tidak boleh ditolak ansur
3318052 itu satu kenyataan dalam pakatan ini saya fikir dalam musyawarah mesyuarat sudah tentu ada tolak ansur dan sebagainya apa pun dasar dasar pas itu perlu dipertahankan
3318053 dan saya fikir untuk membawa dasar seperti itu tentang ahli ahli pakatan yang lain patut dihormati pendapat masing masing dalam penghormatan itulah saya fikir kita dapat satu kesepaduan terhadap sesuatu matlamat yang kita perjuangkan

3318101 it changes russias image there is no doubt about it
3318102 a strong element of revenge particularly from prime minister putin
3318103 revenge against a small country that has chosen to pursue a direction that russia doesnt approve of
3318104 theyve previously tried to use economic sanctions to bring about a change of political leadership
3318105 revenge for georgias efforts to join nato revenge for kosovo revenge for this and that and that is perhaps the kind of emotional reaction that is determining at least some of russian policy right now
3318106 one can only hope that reason will reign in moscow
3318107 ive decided to finish the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace the safety of our peacekeeping forces and civilian population has been restored
3318108 were just enjoying our time we are just recently very recently engaged so we are just taking it easy
3318109 i mean im 23 there is no reason to rush into it everything feels very natural and relaxed
3318110 im so fortunate to be in a very solid and comfortable relationship
3318111 im in a good place in my life right now im a really big believer in loving yourself before you can give love to somebody else
3318112 the healthiest and most inspiring relationships are the ones where youre so comfortable with the other person that you actually learn more about yourself that you could never appreciate before

3318120 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3318121 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3318122 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3318123 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3318124 the people of kuwait are impressed with the independence of the judiciary and trust in general its rulings
3318125 in other arab gulf nations you dont see a court sentencing in this way a member of a ruling family
3318126 there is no immunity for members of the ruling family just for the reason that they are part of this family
3318127 deserves the death sentence for dealing with drugs and narcotics that threaten the security of society and lead its youth into the mire of addiction
3318128 rulers of these states fear the space of democracy in kuwait might at the end affect their power
3318129 for them the kuwaiti phenomenon is like a plague that needs to be contained
3318130 i dont know whether kuwaiti society is satisfied with the ruling of the judiciary or not but its in the hands of the emir
3318131 theft of identifying information is going on at all kinds of levels
3318132 identity theft is one of the fastest growing crimes in southern california
3318133 all the georgians have left we lost it to russia
3318134 there are still people hiding in tskhinvali military men theyre calling us to get them out can you tell the u n the international organizations somebody who can help them
3318135 my home was burned i got nothing out of it
3318136 just because we are not rushing to place u s infantry in tbilisi does not mean the world is impotent in the face of this aggression
3318137 the russians have plenty of money now and we need their oil more than they need our credits
3318138 well get cold but how do you the russians expect your economy to stand without selling oil and gas

3318140 anytime you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
3318141 there are some things i dont think we did a good job on the blitz as they scored a touchdown
3318142 and there were a couple things where we just didnt have really good outside run support there are some good things too i take the good with the bad with that i just hate to see anybody take the ball down the field and score but it was a team that we hadnt worked on that much and it surprised us a little bit how they would run the ball that much am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
3318143 i think we had some problems last year and we kind of got away from that a little bit if it happens again yeah ill be worried but im not now just like we had a good opening drive offensively and almost took it down except for a penalty those things happen in the first game disappointed yeah but im not too concerned right now if it continues like that ill be disappointed
3318144 stop the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3318145 again the devil took him jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory and he said to him
3318146 there is a way that seems right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death
3318147 most single cabinet surround systems typically require reflective walls to optimize a sonic image but with slimstage weve effectively removed this barrier by incorporating patented surround and speaker technologies that dont rely on walls or subwoofers to produce a pinpoint surround sound image and our patented technologies have allowed us to develop a super slim cabinet which unlike others has bass and nearly disappears on furniture or under a flat panel tv
3318148 its going to be canadian its going to be canada
3318149 we certainly want to be able to accomplish for canada what i think the opening ceremonies accomplished for china
3318150 id like every canadian to be inspired by the opening to the 2010 winter olympic and paralympic games id like the world to feel they know a little bit more about canada as the opening ceremonies close
3318151 its canadas olympics its canadas opportunity to remind the world of what were going to be in the 21st century
3318152 the opening ceremonies that have been the most successful are the ones that either define or redefine the culture in way that brings pride to the national audience and a greater understanding of the essential elements of the culture of the host country to the global audience
3318153 literally thousands and thousands of people are volunteering here they are incredibly hospitable they want to help everybody in every way they can they just couldnt be better representatives of china
3318154 i was here in may the difference between transportation now and then is just like night and day its amazing the way they transformed the city
3318155 we take both the athlete and the national olympic committee at their word on this
3318156 my brother just told me that theres a sperm bank in his neighborhood that pays 40 for a donation
3318157 you go around and theres been a lot of guys who have helped us get to this point some with limited playing time
3318158 a few of these guys are going to get more at bats and more playing time and we have confidence they will help keep us in the position that were in today
3318159 were still seeking medical opinions to come up with the best course of action
3318160 obviously its a tough situation but this team has shown great perseverance all year and i expect it will continue
3318161 wir bleiben bei unserer prognose f r 2009 wir werden keine probleme haben einen umsatz von 3 3 mrd euro zu erreichen
3318162 i had never thought i could ever be positive all i knew was that aids was a disease for men who have sex with men
3318163 i decided to end my life and walked towards a bridge that people often went to commit suicide when my sister noticed what i was about to do she arrived just in time and stopped me
3318164 although it was hard to get the confirmation i felt much better than how i felt when my sister ambushed me
3318165 scaling up testing and counseling a human rights and public health imperative
3318166 it is worse for immigrants because unlike my situation where my sister did it because she loved me and because she was ignorant of the impact the immigrants are forced to test be governments by the police total strangers and after which they are deported to their countries without any arrangement for treatment care and support
3318167 even as vastly increased funding for hiv has become available those most vulnerable to hiv and its impact continue to receive the least access to hiv prevention care and treatment in many countries there are many abuses around the manner in which hiv testing and counseling is conducted we are concerned that if issues raised in our advice are not implemented there will be further abuses rather than increased benefits for human rights and public health
3318168 deporting immigrants will not reduce hiv instead the immigrants will go underground conceal their identity and become a risk to others
3318169 the word couple should be programmed to apply to any people in any relationship involving sex including unmarried youth
3318170 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3318171 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3318172 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3318173 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3318174 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months
3318175 i am determined to make the management of ubs more effective
3318176 these candidates bring specific and relevant experience to ubs namely in global financial services the fields of change management and regulation and the perspectives of institutional shareholders
3318177 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3318178 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized

3318180 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3318181 barbadians have been assured of more high quality services from the butter field bank
3318182 banks have staff costs it also costs them a lot of money to run atm machines and other facilities
3318183 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3318184 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3318185 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3318186 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3318187 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3318188 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3318189 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency

3318191 lets make sure this guy gets six reps and he gets two and he gets one
3318192 its still too early to slot guys but were starting to focus in on the group were going to get better with
3318193 were cleaning up a lot of errors and trying to get some consistency now that weve installed most of our offensive and defensive systems we want to become better in our decision making and be aware of what were doing
3318194 clearly we think weve got enough talent but we need them to execute
3318195 we want to see the execution over the individual installation we want to see the guys that can pick things up and execute on a day to day basis
3318196 he could go in there and grit it out and hed be fine
3318197 its about the timing the execution of the receivers and everybody else
3318198 to bring the freshmen up to the same level as tony pike now we can let those guys compete for three out of five spots
3318199 what we said was if youre going to be a backup if thats a comfort level where youre just happy being a backup then this is your last year on scholarship and you need to graduate
3318200 if you want to compete for the starting position thats a different story
3318201 most of that was motivation to get tony in a mind set of listen this thing is wide open if you think youre just going to hang around here and take your scholarship and be happy being like an nfl backup quarterback the best job in america youve got a second thing coming youd better come out and compete
3318202 how do i tell the kid this is your last year but i never give him a chance
3318203 the nice part about it is that in this freshman class theres more guys in play than there were last year
3318204 theyre very solid we have a lot of options with this much depth you have a lot of options on how you can package things people can do different things you can almost flip them in different positions
3318205 each day hes getting more and more experience thats all he needs more experience and well be better as a team
3318206 there were hints in the first season about camerons intentions regarding some of her mysterious behaviour and possibly a dark side
3318207 so i cannot believe what my characters is going to do this year basically in our opening episode everything changes every character goes through this huge change and things are going to be very different from now on my character becomes even more unpredictable than ever and we have so much action in the first episode its like a small movie its really fun for me as an actress so im so thrilled at the scripts this year i think our scripts are even better we have some great locations so its looking beautiful
3318208 researchers argue about why certain cultures have become more individualistic than others some say that western cultures draw their values from ancient greece with its emphasis on individual heroism while other cultures draw on more on tribal philosophies recently some scientists have theorized that it all goes back to microbes collectivist societies tend to pop up in parts of the world especially around the equator with plenty of disease causing microbes in such an environment youd want to shun outsiders who might bring strange diseases and enforce a certain conformity over eating rituals and social behavior

3318215 barbados is an expensive destination and its clear that what people care most about when choosing their holiday is the cost of a driving license not accomodation flight costs or the destinations profile which is why i expect tourism arrivals to fall by 1 291 in direct response to this measure
3318216 we shouldnt be too worried about recessions in the key us and uk tourist markets or the macro economic details of the budget lets shout really really loudly about driving licenses
3318217 weve been losing money and running awful hotels for so long that we didnt realise people cared any more were just salaried bureaucrats and it ent our money so we dont give a green monkey what happens to the hotels what really gets me though is the choice of gems as a name it gives almost everyone an opportunity to dust off their bad headlines for the day
3318218 before we close gems down and use it to beat the blp again and again weve decided to change the name to something less easy to headline and are asking the public for suggestions our starter for ten is crap crazy resort accomodation plan or bad blp awful deal but we encourage the public to write to me directly with their ideas
3318219 gems hotels fail to sparkle lose their shine put in dull performace etc

3318234 i have been here a long time now and played at anfield many times i know one day we are going to have to move but that will be a difficult day because this is such a special place to play football
3318235 even though it was a pre season friendly against lazio it was a great atmosphere and long may that continue into the season
3318236 it is easy to switch from friendlies to competitive games we have to do it every year after pre season but we do treat pre season games as important
3318237 we said before the lazio game that that was our first game really it was a full house against a top class side
3318238 every pre season is pretty much the same all about getting the fitness ready for that first game you cant judge how it has gone until youve played the first couple of games of the season if we start well well say we had a great pre season if we dont well look at it the other way
3318239 if were going to compete even at premier league level let alone europe we need a decent squad we need to keep adding quality
3318240 weve lost bouma and we were quite thin before that we need to try and safeguard as much as we can
3318241 weve brought in a recognised right back and a recognised left back to help us we didnt have the right back last year but it wasnt for lack of trying

3318244 chelsea ran them very close last year and ive got a sneaking feeling they might go one better
3318245 manchester united are sure to be without cristiano ronaldo at the start of the season and hes a big miss even for just a few games
3318246 once again i think it will be very tight between the two
3318247 its been hard for manchester united to plan for next season with so many rumours and possibilities surrounding their star player
3318248 it would have been unsettling for the management they werent sure if he was going to go would they get the money to spend on replacements
3318249 the fans will be a bit disgruntled for a while but once he plays a couple of games and bangs in some goals it will quickly get forgotten
3318250 you can foresee a change in style with scolari favouring a more attacking and free spirited sort of game pass and move rather than the slightly negative style of play that chelsea have played over the last few years
3318251 you need a mixture of experience and youth and chelsea probably have that
3318252 you need players of experience and stature when push comes to shove
3318253 thats where they fell short last year and i cant see anything in their squad to change that they will always have a chance though because they play such beautiful football
3318254 with torres in their side theyll always score goals but overall you wonder if theyve quite got the squad to compete with the others
3318255 its fair to say the teams that come up will struggle by and large
3318256 why is it that food always tastes better when its on a stick
3318257 its obvious that they want to use this as evidence for the guernsey court to continue extending a freeze on a bnp paribas account belonging to my client
3318258 for every disbursement i had to write a request letter to aulia and maman somantri and also to the chief of the indonesian banking development foundation yppi
3318259 as of now we have not heard of any plans that have been cancelled
3318260 if they do not build now they would miss their chance when market conditions improve
3318261 in the future smelters certainly will go for scale the smelter with larger capacity can survive better
3318262 huayin is not totally controlled by chalco it probably prefers to put more funds into its australian project
3318263 chalco may take the bauxite for its middle east project
3318264 smelters may not think of drafting new expansion plans right now amid high costs and low prices but once the market turns new capacity will be built and come onstream within months
3318265 i know him and i think hes very nice but he likes to court the press and he can be provocative
3318266 the important thing is to keep your tongue in your cheek and i have enjoyed exchanging remarks with him you just cant take things too seriously
3318267 i didnt expect things to be so difficult at this stage
3318268 the defence isnt working and neither is the attack only the midfield has been good

3318288 so you have eight years of experience with c and asp net
3318289 but i thought that c was only six years old

3318292 the moment i stepped into the camps here in lebanon i thought i was in palestine
3318293 i hope people living in beirut come to see the film
3318294 a window into palestine maybe feel a little more connected the palestinian hip hop scene there
3318295 this film is about a loss of identity as much as anything else
3318296 hip hop is a way of telling their stories as they reclaim that history
3318297 if there parents arent teaching them theyre simply brought up as israeli arabs and not palestinians
3318298 lets talk about what it means to be palestinians living in the state of israel
3318299 but yeah your grandfather before you was a palestinian so youre actually palestinian
3318300 you saw in the film how that one kid called himself an arab and not a palestinian this is what my palestinian friends are taught in israeli schools
3318301 dam has affected the youth in their hometown especially because they are active in the schools and it doesnt hurt that their music has gotten really popular kids are listening and wanting to read more books by palestinian writers and know more about their cousins in the west bank and gaza they want to be like dam
3318302 the film inspires me to want to break down the social barriers that exist for palestinians living in the refugee camps here
3318303 our music is as much for palestinians there as it is for the lebanese here
3318304 there is a very real geographic separation within the palestinian hip hop movement
3318305 these groups are all restricted physically by the israeli government and the film shows how they use their music to channel their frustrations and connect with their peers
3318306 they cant travel to see each other so they trade beats and vocal tracks over the internet right now all the groups are reaching out to other arab rappers throughout the world the u s based crews the philistines and the nomads the iraqi hip hop crew from canada euphrates and they are also working on collaborations with several african and latin america based hip hop crews
3318307 were working with dam and another group from the west bank ramallah underground my partner tnt and i are laying down our vocals and we should have something finished soon
3318308 one day i hope we can perform together but it will probably be in europe before its either here or in palestine

3318353 all i can do is try to get myself fit

3318362 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century

3318397 apart from people wanting to travel to the islands and queensland weve also had a lot of enquiries from people wanting to know about cruises

3318416 together serena and valtech will ensure that business stakeholders product owners and engineering teams can all equally succeed at acquiring the skill and value that agile tools and best practices offer across the entire software and product development team while moving quickly to adoption and showing a compelling business return

3318429 ive let the lads know what the carlisle boys are about
3318430 and im sure they will want to do well against a team that could easily have been playing in the championship this season

3318436 they would then send them through the proper channels for the papers to be served on mr jackson in california
3318437 tito sought the loan because he was unable to borrow the money from within his own family
3318438 my family love the wonderful countryside and friendly people michael likes north devon too as no one bothers him
3318439 its about the respect and principle of the matter not money i lent tito the money on the basis that it would be repaid we flew him over on may 22 and worked with him on the making of the documentary

3318444 the positive sentiment seen at the end of first quarter 2008 that the credit crisis may be easing was short lived as trading conditions deteriorated significantly in the second half of may in particular for assets related to u s residential real estate as well as other structured credit positions
3318445 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3318446 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3318447 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model
3318448 some of these weaknesses such as the blurring of the true risk reward profile of individual businesses are the source of substantial risk as we have seen in the past few months

3318452 het is een prettige man die elke ochtend een rondje over de werkvloer maakt voor een praatje hij is gedreven weet wat hij wil hij drukt bij tijd en wijle zijn zin door maar plaatst zichzelf niet op een voetstuk van stress merk je niets aan hem hij blijft altijd kalm
3318453 hij was bij schiphol groep zelf lid van het het managementteam het is hem gelukt zijn directe collegas te overtuigen van een nieuwe aanpak voor een nieuw vluchtinformatiesysteem natuurlijk waren er barri res maar de man kan goed lobbyen tussen aanhalingstekens ja hij weet heel subtiel mensen voor zich te winnen
3318454 ja over ict onderwerpen kan hij goed meepraten maar zijn grote kracht is toch wel dat hij een echte people manager is
3318455 zijn grote liefde is vliegen hij heeft zelf geen brevet geloof ik maar hij doet wel mee aan internationale competities op de flightsimulator en als er op schiphol een toestel binnenkwam dat hij nog nooit had gezien dan regelde hij toestemming om het platform op te gaan om te kijken

3318461 the region contributed about 23 percent of our total 25 3 million ringgit us 7 6 million revenue for the financial year 2007
3318462 this has been spurred by increasing market liberalization and capacity
3318463 for example bahrains telecommunications market is expected to transform the ict market into a us 375 billion industry by 2010 due to high demand for it products and services from both public and private sectors
3318464 this is because the customers will be studying the very same criteria on each prospective vendor
3318465 the middle eastern partners need to be able to source for local equipment suppliers which also have to have good after sales and local manpower support
3318466 even so stiff competition will make one rethink ones strategies there
3318467 companies with good local partners and a sound business strategy stand a better chance of succeeding in the region in the long run
3318468 but malaysia has a bit of an advantage in that they see us as a friendly and progressive islamic country
3318469 there have been some middle eastern firms that have begun accepting malaysian ict consulting expertise that are competitive in nature especially when they realized that western firms have been overcharging them

3318486 i saw a lot of him when i was manager of derby and he was at nottingham forest
3318487 he transferred to derby in the summer and i had him watched
3318488 i think he will give us a different dimension he is a boy with a lot of ability he is a naturally left sided winger and maybe we have lacked width in the squad
3318489 i spoke to the boy and he was keen and enthusiastic to join the squad
3318490 callum is an experienced player who has played for scotland in the past
3318491 he did very well for preston and i watched him in a pre season game against motherwell
3318492 he is fit and injury free and this is an opportunity to look at him

3318501 australia as a team is still far ahead yes we can beat australia and we have proved that but to do it consistently we have to improve a lot i think once we become more consistent we can think of being number one

3318505 you get driven by results but they havent been good enough this year we havent done all the disciplines well enough particularly our batting and catching
3318506 things havent gone to plan with overseas signings shane bond had a few injuries shane watson had to pull out a week or so before he was due here but weve been lucky with our current one imran tahir
3318507 but im of the belief that if you rely on your overseas players then youre not going to be a particularly strong squad
3318508 you cannot ask a rahul dravid sachin tendulkar sourav ganguly vvs laxman or anil kumble to prove their credentials

3318537 she may not have realised she was depressed and i think it was a spontaneous and impulsive reaction to pressures around her
3318538 i think she resorted to what would be to her previous culture something that was done if anything it was a cry for help because she had no other way of expressing herself
3318539 i dont think she had any understanding of the danger of using accelerants and fire

3318563 there are currently no approved drugs to treat ph associated with copd and it is estimated that this disease may affect up to six million people worldwide

3318565 there is an undeniable need for safe and effective treatments for patients with ph associated with copd
3318566 we believe this drug may be an important advance toward effective treatment for patients with this progressive lung disease and hope to see reductions in pulmonary artery blood pressure and improvements in exercise capacity in this trial similar to those seen in previous trials with prx 08066 using more rigorous techniques

3318671 i just wanted to get out there and try to hold on
3318672 i knew koreas taehwan park was going to have a good last 50 so i tried to start as far ahead as i could in the first 100 to 150
3318673 i wanted to just get through the 200 fly race try not to go all out try to be conservative a little bit
3318674 i felt fine im not coming back tonight im just recovering back at the village and preparing for wednesdays race those are two big races
3318675 ive never seen anything like that 400 free relay in my entire life that was by far the most exciting sports even not just swim event ive ever seen

3318685 today i started off offensively a bit flat but my team has stuck with me and we started getting some momentum everyones waiting for me to contribute it was great to finally be able to do that
3318686 after something so tragic and so sudden it makes you think of others

3318695 with all the emotion that went into that i just had to force myself to put it out of my head
3318696 its not easy but with so many races i know i have so much to do in every race
3318697 the way natalie swam and of course michael had an absolutely beautiful race i dont think we could have planned it any better the u s team is absolutely snowballing and hopefully we can keep it going

3318741 we need that to happen this year if we want to be viable because the best teams in this league have great defenses and we havent been a great defense weve been improving getting better but i believe that this year youre gonna see a significant step on the defensive side at the university of kentucky
3318742 i can better prepare myself in the weight room better prepare myself out there conditioning on the field and better prepare myself in the film room to make sure that i can top those stats that i produced last year or cause mere havoc that i caused last year to almost guarantee that i find my way onto first team

3318773 thinking about development in africa requires holding at least two sets of ideas in ones head at the same time it is not sufficient to stress the ubiquity of failure malnutrition disease predatory states and war or to become overwhelmed by revulsion in the face of the misery still experienced by so many africans in addition it must also be recognized that some important aspects of the lives of millions of ordinary people have been transformed over the last five decades it is on the basis of a clear perception of the complexity and unevenness of all these processes as well as a critical analysis of the consequences of economic policies in the past that politically realistic development strategies can be formulated

3318778 so far cities are getting whatever resource needs that can be had from rural areas but given global rural impoverishment the rural urban question for the future is not just what rural people and places can do for the worlds new urban majority rather what can the urban majority do for poor rural people and the resources upon which cities depend for existence the sustainable future of the new urban world may well depend upon the answer
3318779 results havent gone the way i or the club would have liked i feel its the right time to stand aside and give them time to find someone else
3318780 you get driven by results but they havent been good enough this year we havent done all the disciplines well enough particularly our batting and catching
3318781 things havent gone to plan with overseas signings shane bond had a few injuries shane watson had to pull out a week or so before he was due here but weve been lucky with our current one imran tahir

3318785 i have loved every minute of being at uwe i knew the experience would be different to what im used to i was used to a parent or teacher trying to make you work whereas you are given the freedom at uni to make your own choices but try not to worry you still have guidance and support needed and university really is worth a try moses has previously studied at adt college in wandsworth although money and work can be tough what you get out of doing a degree will shape your independence you really cant describe it until you are there
3318786 however its more likely that i will just go straight into working for a company such as lloyds tsb
3318787 at the time the results were published i was on the other side of the world so going through clearing was the easiest thing to do
3318788 i had already visited uwe and was very impressed with its facilities they offered me a place on a different course from my original choice of initial teacher training at uwe my parents said it was a quick and efficient process staff answered our concerns and kept in touch
3318789 the course i have consequently been studying is a fantastic course which i have found diverse interesting and contextual and i am actually glad it worked out this way so glad in fact that i have decided to return to uwe this autumn to do a further course gaining the new qualification in early years professional status a result of the every child matters government initiative
3318790 my experience of uwe has been exciting challenging hugely rewarding and eye opening variety is the spice of life and theres enough to go round at uwe i have never met so many diverse and interesting people learnt so many things about myself and my degree and been so wholly accepted for who i am as i have at uwe

3318798 it details the philosophical position of exit that all rational adults should have access to the means of a peaceful death
3318799 she was assessed as someone we were unable to help because of her age and history of psychiatric illness
3318800 her death is a tragedy but not one that exit takes responsibility for
3318801 highlighting the connections between this information and actions taken by erin
3318802 erins behavior in killing herself exactly mirrored information provided in killing me softly
3318803 at the end of the path was a loaded gun provided courtesy of philip nitschke
3318804 it wasnt intended specifically for erin but it was there for her to use regardless
3318805 as someone who watched erin die a long death in a country a long way from home we can say with some clarity that such guarantees should be treated with suspicion
3318806 erin learned in the most horrendous way possible that accepting black and white guarantees from a person who has built a business around the invincibility of a certain suicide method is probably not a wise thing to do
3318807 still under consideration and we hope to have a response soon
3318808 exit can now say with 100 percent confidence that nembutal is widely cheaply and legally available one only needs to know the location of a veterinary supplier and the labeling in use at that location
3318809 on the basis of exit research the best places to visit are the 20 odd border crossings from tijuana in california through to matamoros on the gulf of mexico
3318810 remember though while it is legal to purchase nembutal in mexico it is a crime to import nembutal into most other countries
3318811 we will now be advising our members not to undertake medical testing for alzheimers disease if they think they may wish to end their lives in the future
3318812 test results could be used as they were in this case to make out a murder case against those who love you enough to want to help you to have the choice of a peaceful death
3318813 i think its high time that the authorities took action against dr nitschke
3318814 i would like to see the book withdrawn from sale and the so called euthanasia advice clinics should not be allowed to take place either
3318815 heres this man roaming the country telling people how they can kill themselves how they can gain access to these drugs
3318816 end of life decision making drug and overseas options including switzerland amp nembutal from mexico and the on going peaceful pill project
3318817 my family has always been left wing pro choice people and before this we assumed nitschke was an okay sounding guy who was advocating for vulnerable people in our community
3318818 this has changed with erins death and after having actually read killing me softly which is a horrifying book containing dangerous information
3318819 we want people to ask in whose interests is this man acting

3318923 despite best buys growth opportunities we think the sluggish macro environment and increased competition at retail will continue to weigh on results in both the short and long term
3318924 we are increasingly concerned by the competitive environment with discounters foray into providing services for the consumer
3318925 customer service and installation is one of best buys competitive advantages in a highly competitive and commoditized industry while wal mart and target have no where near the service level of best buy which includes home installation from magnolia and geek squad the fact that these companies are starting to offer installation in a difficult environment could result in a slow down in share gains or possibly even share loss for best buy

3318964 the basic foundation that initial spark of innovation is still there
3318965 were very open minded and are always looking to the horizon to see whats up ahead were very dedicated to our craft and were constantly trying to progress that ultimately is a motivating factor in keeping a band like this going its a laboratory in essence where some great experiments have taken place
3318966 our intention was to include some of the earlier tunes but to play them in the way we play now
3318967 paris was one of the strongest shows on that tour live performances in general are always very much in the moment and the results can be hit or miss sometimes some nights are better than others but everything came together on this particular night
3318968 when a new piece is added to the puzzle the band automatically takes on a new personality without even thinking about it
3318969 but these guys are just so open minded they just say hey lets just play not necessarily this way or that way but lets just play and find a way to connect the pieces of the puzzle together and when we do play we are of one mind personally thats what i want people to see more than just this guy who plays great or that guy who plays great i just want people to see four guys who work well as a unit and move in the same direction to make positive music for our listeners to enjoy
3318970 tony came to los angeles and we talked for hours at various locations including the studio where we recorded with robben ford

3318972 i think we could be together for another 25 years
3318973 its the kind of band that could thrive for a long time because of the democratic philosophy and the level of commitment to what we do theres a long standing bond that we share and i dont think it will ever go away its just something that developed over the years of playing together and making music together

3318979 for marketing vacation rentals the best part is that updated rates are automatically distributed to all online partner sites in real time it is remarkably powerful
3318980 at escapia our goal is to give our customers the best tools to help them book more business and manage those bookings efficiently
3318981 this latest release shows our firm commitment to that goal and our clients are thrilled since they expect escapia intellirate to provide them with a major competitive advantage
3318982 this initiative is a logical next step in the companys efforts to capitalize on its strong base of innovative development programs and intellectual property that is focused on the treatment of cardiovascular disease as well as diseases caused by a wide variety of lipid enveloped viruses our hdl therapy program has achieved important clinical and pre clinical milestones with the completion of a successful safety and feasibility clinical trial at the washington hospital center in washington d c combined with powerful in vivo and in vitro data supporting the anti atherosclerosis and anti inflammatory design goals of the companys lead hdl mimetic peptide candidate lsi 518p we have built a broad and strategic portfolio of intellectual property assets covering all of our development programs which we believe will provide significant value to a potential partner or acquirer
3318983 the statutes before us here are sufficiently different from the previous enactments so as to avoid the blanket application of stare decisis and to warrant a fresh review of their individual merits
3318984 this is the first time a scheduled service to the balearic island of ibiza has been made available from our airport and the destination remains extremely popular with the travelling public
3318985 its amazing what drivers would want in their cars if they had complete freedom of choice
3318986 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3318987 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3318988 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3318989 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3318990 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3318991 i guess i just lost my husband i dont know where he went so im gonna drink my money im not gonna pay his rent nope i hate marriage
3318992 i dont need you and guess what im having more fun and now that were done im gonna show you tonight im alright im just fine
3318993 offshore drilling whose issue is it anyway the peoples or the politicians
3318994 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3318995 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3318996 you should have been here yesterday it was such a nice day
3318997 my ideal man is a 16 year old chris martin but my mom says i have terrible taste
3318998 the sensors available at that time were no good for space systems because they were big quite heavy and used a lot of heating power
3318999 so we had to develop a new type of miniaturized sensor to measure re entry conditions for spacecraft the sensors had to be very small and capable of measuring oxygen at high altitudes and during re entry
3319000 it is very easy to find terrestrial applications for this miniaturized gas sensor the sensor reacts very fast and this is useful in many cases where you need to measure ambient conditions on earth
3319001 one application where the sensor is particularly useful is measurement of the human breath with this sensor we can measure oxygen carbon dioxide and the flow of human breath and obtain the results immediately something which is impossible with the conventional systems
3319002 the sensor works well with combustible gasses and can be used to optimize the burners in industrial plants and home heating systems if you place the sensor in the exhaust gases you can control the heaters in real time by using a special algorithm and ensure that the burner operates at an optimum level
3319003 this system can reduce the exhaust gases that are harmful for the environment and at the same time by ensuring the heating system works at an optimum level it can also reduce fuel consumption by about 10 to 15
3319004 we will see more technology spinning back into space in the future
3319005 while there are still opportunities for improvement the panels finding concluded that nasa is making significant progress in improving safety issues during the past year
3319006 commends the constellation program for endorsing the recommendation of the asap and continuing to employ early hazard and risk analysis
3319007 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3319008 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3319009 inspire gives students parents and teachers a mechanism for interacting with one another
3319010 they ask questions share knowledge and build a community of practice that nasa hopes will lead them to pursue careers in fields critical to nasa and the nation
3319011 since the programs inception nasa has been working an aggressive plan to achieve flight capability before our march 2015 target
3319012 we are still confident the constellation program will make its first flight to the international space station on or before that date our new path forward better aligns our project schedules with our existing funds to ensure we can address the unplanned challenges that always arise when developing a complex flight system
3319013 we think the continued falling international crude oil prices would have an impact in future earnings in the oil sector in next 12 months
3319014 korean athletes in beijing are providing great joy to their compatriots at home who have long been gloomy over the political strife and stagnant economy
3319015 ten and 10 which means 10 gold medals and a top 10 finish in the overall medals table was certainly a modest goal for the 260 strong korean contingent to beijing and the early performance allows the prediction of a better outcome
3319016 a young generation of korean athletes is conquering the world of swimming speed skating fencing and other sports once regarded as hopeless because koreans were shorter than their western competitors
3319017 parks success is the result of a combination of endeavors his natural gifts his endurance and discipline years of hard work science and coaching
3319018 the number of people in need of help increases by the hour

3319020 its a natural maternity ward the place where mothers teach their calves how to feed and how to utilize the tides and currents
3319021 the most spectacular thing i saw was a calf practicing breaching as if it was an adult just like a kid would do at a playground
3319022 i cant believe it this is just an amazing feeling it was my dream since i was a small child
3319023 it is fantastic to be olympic champion again after 12 years my dream has come true
3319024 significant increase in sales plus tight control of costs during the period
3319025 the result demonstrates once again the great strength of our classic product lines and the importance of combining these with new strong licences
3319026 humpbacks and southern right whales are making a comeback in much of their range mainly because they have been protected from commercial hunting
3319027 this is a great conservation success and clearly shows what needs to be done to ensure these ocean giants survive
3319028 the news that humpback and the southern right whales have stepped back from the brink of extinction is certainly good news but this still does not mean that we have a healthy viable population with anywhere near historic population numbers
3319029 for more than half of cetacean species we are unable to definitively say whether particular populations are declining or increasing and the reality for some species could be worse than we currently believe
3319030 this is an alarming state of affairs and international efforts must be made to determine the status of these populations
3319031 new zealand has a long history promoting the conservation of whales and we will continue to do so
3319032 overall nearly a quarter of cetacean species are considered threatened and of those more than 10 per cent nine species are listed as endangered or critically endangered the highest categories of threat
3319033 in addition two subspecies and 12 sub populations are listed as critically endangered
3319034 the real situation could be much worse as more than half of the cetacean species 44 species are classed as data deficient meaning future research needs to be a priority
3319035 its expected that the task team will report to the icc and participating countries soon after which csa will discuss the matter further
3319036 our forces on the ground are withdrawing from the conflict areas so we expect fighting to end by tomorrow wednesday
3319037 we are always looking at humanitarian disaster everytime huge numbers of people are driven from their homes
3319038 we need the help of some korean agencies like the pkch to find immediate solution to the migrants labor related problems
3319039 filipino communities should work with koreans in dealing with social issues and problems and they need to know more about pkch as they offer free eye clinic service by appointment basis rebenson
3319040 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3319054 one can hold on to private sector banks with a stoploss maybe at 4 or 4 5 lower than the current levels because the bounces on these counters are very robust so should the market decide to go up again this sector is likely to be a market outperformer so there is no need to panic as such and press the sell button as a blanket sell kind of a thing
3319055 marico is a delivery based investment for a patient investor with a minimum timeframe of four quarters i e 12 months and ideally around six quarters i e 18 months delivery based buying at the present levels with some scope for averaging up to rs 52 should be the stock go down with a stoploss at rs 46 47 levels and a profit taking target at a band of between rs 67 to rs 74 in the timeframe specified
3319056 i would be negative on metals at the moment this is a commodity driven thing for oil there is still some room here to be positive at the moment my best pick in the oil sector in the sense of a safe pick would be reliance industries which has done fairly well today and may be cairn but if one wants to take a risk i would go for the completely busted psu refiners and omcs because they are ones in worst shape and hence the ones that would gain the most from a continued drop in crude i would be long on oil
3319057 ongc has room to go up from these levels as well i would be long on ongc
3319058 sugar as a sector is looking fairly good i think it has a potential to be a market out performer in the coming few weeks balrampur chini has a potential to go all the way up to rs 110 115
3319059 when i was growing up there were many athletes to look up to and so i know young people need to have positive role models to get so many of the worlds best known athletes together for the heroes advert shows the athletes commitment to the olympic movement and the olympic values and on behalf of the ioc i am grateful to them for giving up time out of their busy training schedules for the project we hope that the heroes advert will really capture the imagination and inspire young people around the world

3319064 because most people are too imprisoned in the moment to plan with this kind of foresight the ability to ignore immediate dangers and pleasures translates into power it is the power of being able to overcome the natural human tendency to react to things as they happen and instead to train oneself to step back imagining the larger things taking shape beyond ones immediate vision
3319065 you see my company and my organization in particular has quite the standard for the people we are looking for

3319079 but i saw aaron as like he is every day i thought he went out there and played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with

3319102 i have taken the decision to end the operation to force georgian authorities into peace
3319103 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3319104 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3319105 the purpose of the operation has been achieved the security of our peacekeeping forces and the civilian population has been restored
3319106 moving tanks and troops through the separatist enclave of south ossetia and advancing toward the city of gori in central georgia
3319107 if we launch a war with russia which would seem to be the point of busting out the analogy then how are we going to find the time to launch wars with iran and china
3319108 russian peacekeepers and military units attached to them have been taking action to prevent georgia from shelling south ossetia and russian peacekeepers
3319109 we should understand that russian channels are not just channels of an unfriendly state which are engaged in disinformation but they are tv channels of the state which declared war and is bombing our territories
3319110 we were filming in the city centre at the parliament building where refugees from south ossetia held their meeting we were cut short by some people who took away our camera and material the cameraman and the sound engineer were beaten up the men had camouflaged uniforms on and most likely represented some kind of law enforcement body we managed to get our camera back but not what we had filmed
3319111 hopefully this is only temporary the main internet provider in georgia blocked our access to the russian website we are not thinking about closing permanently because weve always had good co operation with our russian partners we try to provide balance and our readers dont understand whether were a georgian or a russian news agency because we present both sides objectively now our readers in russia are not getting a georgian perspective of what is happening
3319112 theyre moving victims of torture and other abuses out of beijing and replacing them with individuals who parrot the ccps stance on falun gong

3319166 the bottom line is this the requirement existed that credentialed tutors were required the practice existed that parents homeschooled without having credentials as tutors the legislature and state agencies accepted the practice despite the law the court recognized this occurred and concluded that because it occurred the practice was accepted despite the existence of the law more importantly the court held that despite the constitutional rights of parents to the upbringing and education of their children the state can override that right while nheld is gratified that parents in california will be able to continue to homeschool as they did previously we continue to admonish all parents to become fully informed of what the statutes in their state actually say and to adhere to the provisions of those statutes if parents do not agree with the requirements in those statutes the appropriate way pursuant to the constitution to change that law is by an appeal to the legislature of that state not to the courts

3319185 the fact that there are a number of models coming out might give the indication that the market is growing and everybody wants to do this but whats interesting is you pull back the covers and talk to people in the industry and theyre kind of scared
3319186 if you cant grow the market with this form factor then what youre providing is a lower experience for less money which isnt good for the consumer and isnt good for the hardware maker and really isnt good for the channel as well

3319205 its always great to beat the olympic champions we hadnt raced them yet this year so it was a worry but we were going well im pleased with the race but we need to be quicker for the final
3319206 im very happy with my race and did everything that i had planned with my coach the quarterfinal system makes for an extra race which is not easy for me the first two races werent too hard but it will be more difficult in the semifinal
3319207 in the olympics to race is really hard so that was not comfortable differently from our heat this time our job was to go out and win we had a really good first 1500m but then we ran out of beans a little bit too early in the boat hester goodsell is the strategic brain obviously i have to be aware of that but i just set up the rhythm and go now i feel ive given everything but theres more to come we could pace ourselves better to give us a chance for a sprint at the end
3319208 we didnt start the race so well even though we were very confident during these races we try to focus on ourselves and not the others im glad as a lightweight that we are not living in the olympic village with so much food available
3319209 this is my first olympics but the way to race is the same theres more pressure on me than usual but i am working on it chrysi biskitzi and i are compatible we dont have the same types of body so chrysi can recover some weight for me and this works well
3319210 it was a hard battle and we are lucky that we won because my partner is a very good fighter
3319211 the opposition especially hungary is very strong and portugal also has a very good boat it was good to come second we are both quite small so have no problem with weight communication is very important in our boat we both decide on the tactics
3319212 were usually an a final team and weve improved a lot since poznan in the last quarter something went wrong but we really dont know what yet we dont understand why we came fourth
3319213 our heat was more difficult than the repechage today it was good to get close to the teams and we managed to sprint at the end and win just as we did in poznan at the qualifying regatta now we have more will to win and more motivation we had one and a half months to prepare for the olympics after poznan but a lot of other teams have had a year we are in good shape and want to get the best result for portugal the olympic village is spectacular and a lot of fun
3319214 this was much better than in our heat when we had a weak start we were much happier at the start today and felt really solid well need to improve to make the final we know we are good enough to be in the top five but have to prove it to ourselves no one is the brains of this boat we try to leave the brains out of it maybe thats what went wrong in our heat too much thinking
3319215 so yes let me conclude by sticking to just one word astounding youll just love the 4870 x2
3319216 we are trying to be more systematic and thorough in handling the subsidy issue we cannot sustain it we believe that we must go through deregulation of the price we are engaging the stakeholders to work with us the n700 billion subsidy is over n100 billion above this years capital vote
3319217 the truth is that we must separate myth from reality
3319218 and dont forget that it would also take an average of 24 months to build a new refinery there is a huge market for petroleum products but people are not investing because they cant sell at market price to recoup their investments
3319219 we have embarked on a study to see how the vulnerable people who will in the end be on the receiving end of the phased deregulation be protected and since the issue of subsidy is such a sensitive one we have involved all stakeholders and even the organised labour to deal with the fall out
3319220 these are loans that go to fund education health related issues like hiv aids and rural water supply programmes with immediate social gains
3319221 they are not wasted as may be assumed by many but bulk of it is still in the vault of the central bank of nigeria by october 2008 75 per cent of the capital vote would have been utilised

3319225 those affected were trying to destabilise the system by making statements that were detrimental to the unity of the country
3319226 the retired officers had spent 19 months in the barracks and the rule says that they could only stay for three months after retirement since all their benefits and entitlements had been fully paid
3319227 are no longer under any authority and as such are security risks to serving officers and personnel
3319228 because the federal governments policy on sale of houses affected them
3319229 this recalcitrant airline can neither claim to be unaware of the fact that the sultan and his entourage were waiting at the vip lounge nor pretend not to know they had not boarded as at the time the flight took off
3319230 therefore the british airways action smacks of blatant operational inefficiency at best and sheer perhaps deliberate assault of its host countrys sensibilities at worst whichever way british airways must not go scot free
3319231 it is high time the nigerian government signal to foreign airlines and missions in the country that it will no longer tolerate the shabby treatment of its citizens
3319232 in any case it is also possible that the airline is taking a cue from the british high commission in nigeria which like other foreign missions here have made the humiliation of nigerian citizens their past time just because they dare to seek travel visas

3319278 cps energy is committed to 1 200 megawatts of renewable energy by 2020
3319279 since i was here last the energy efficiency goals have increased but cps can go much farther on energy efficiency
3319280 you have a lot of new housing a lot of development and a lot of people want to come here so you need an economical electricity system
3319281 but you also want a clean electricity system that can survive the earthquakes of financial risk environmental risk carbon dioxide risk and the biggest potential to addressing those risks is with efficiency
3319282 it is not the states with the greatest energy consumption per capita that are the wealthiest and most prosperous
3319283 california consumes about half the electricity per capita as the rest of the country
3319284 relying on efficiency will lower costs and will be much cheaper than nuclear power and it will save you between 1 5 billion and 3 billion to rely on renewable energy and efficiency compared to nuclear energy

3319291 our pickups and suvs are already the fuel economy leaders of their respective segments but our engineers knew greater efficiency was achievable we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible
3319292 in addition to the xfe models gm already offers hybrid versions of the tahoe and yukon that achieve up to a 50 percent improvement in city fuel economy and coming in the first half of 2009 are the silverado and sierra hybrids
3319293 these hybrid pickups offer up to 25 percent overall increased fuel economy and greater than 40 percent improved mileage in city driving

3319303 no plans to force anyone from power this is not in our political culture at all
3319304 russia supports the osce and eu line that a ceasefire agreement is absolutely essential but we have questions over several points
3319305 we can hardly agree to this as it implies that georgian so called peacekeepers should be in south ossetia georgian peacekeepers cannot be there they committed crimes shooting their own russian colleagues with whom they were serving
3319306 the fact that with his barbaric acts in south ossetia he saakashvili has undermined the viability of the georgian state shows the ossetian and abkhaz peoples that they will not be safe together with georgia
3319307 the crimes committed by the tbilisi regime in south ossetia merit investigation at an international tribunal

3319314 i barely had enough time to relax between races now i just have to go back and get some food in my system ive been able to recover as much as i can tonight will be some extra recovery time which will be crucial for the next races
3319315 i hate to lose and getting third in the 200 free four years ago when i do lose in a race like that it motivates me even more to get better sometimes im successful and sometimes im not in the last four years ive been able to make some pretty significant drops in the 200 free
3319316 being in lane 6 i wasnt out in the middle of the pool

3319357 we are not staying home with our children by default
3319358 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3319359 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening

3319394 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
3319395 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
3319396 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
3319397 we just dont have as much money as we used to
3319398 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
3319399 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
3319400 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
3319401 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
3319402 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
3319403 we are not staying home with our children by default
3319404 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
3319405 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
3319406 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
3319407 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
3319408 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
3319409 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
3319410 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
3319411 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible

3319423 in the morning when the sun casts shadows low and you can see that ripple effect on the land it looks a lot like the old course at st andrews spence said
3319424 i didnt want it to be another chip and putt
3319425 its a great course where if you leave the driver at home youll think youre playing any big course
3319426 theres no preconceived notion of what goes where everythings fresh
3319427 and theyd look at me funny and say whos he
3319428 they ask me how i managed to get kris spence

3319448 wir sind gespannt auf die resonanz f r unser erstes world of warcraft arena turnier
3319449 unsere analysen ergaben dass die meisten anbieter und systemintegratoren flexibel auf alle vom kunden gew nschten sourcing varianten reagieren k nnen
3319450 die verlockende option zugeschnittene ims komponenten im plug and play verfahren in betrieb nehmen zu k nnen kommt f r netzbetreiber ohne einf hrungerfahrung kaum in frage
3319451 das bewerbungs und auswahlverfahren hat sich jedoch in den letzten jahren ver ndert
3319452 wir rufen unsere unternehmen gerade in der schlussphase der ausbildungssaison dazu auf noch unbesetzte ausbildungspl tze der agentur f r arbeit in bonn oder siegburg zu nennen nur so k nnen die unternehmen sicher stellen gen gend bewerbungen zu erhalten
3319453 f r die bewerber hei t das aber auch bei der ausbildungsplatzsuche andere m glichkeiten zu suchen um unternehmen auf sich aufmerksam zu machen gute erfahrungen machen unternehmen und bewerber immer wieder mit ersten kontakten etwa im rahmen eines betriebsbesuches oder eines tages der offenen t r sowie mit darauf aufbauenden praktika w hrend der schulzeit oder in den ferien

3319456 i worship woody and id do anything in one of his movies
3319457 im so fortunate to be in a very solid and comfortable relationship im in a good place in my life right now im a really big believer in loving yourself before you can give love to somebody else
3319458 the healthiest and most inspiring relationships are the ones where youre so comfortable with the other person that you actually learn more about yourself that you could never appreciate before
3319459 when mercy is no longer a baby we want her back i do not want the money they said theyd give me
3319460 it was painful and a big struggle and i didnt understand it in the end i rationalized that when a woman goes through natural childbirth she suffers an enormous amount i went through my own kind of birthing pains
3319461 for the rest of my career here i dont want any more of those ive had enough to last a lifetime
3319462 i was holding jude and paul walked right in front of us
3319463 jude was smiling at him i told my wife to get the camera out and he stopped he said please no pictures but then started playing some more
3319464 now it doesnt matter if jude gets teased the man himself played the harmonica for him
3319465 i want to prove they have made a big mistake i dont think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here
3319466 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds i am waiting
3319467 its really disappointing of course it is but at the time amy was going through some s t and now shes doing great so who cares if we missed the bond boat
3319468 its fantastic to see her back on track again were both gutted we missed out on 007 but there will be other great opportunities for us
3319469 kelly was the ultimate host and even when the bar bill began to spiral out of control she didnt close the tab
3319470 at one point kelly started dancing and put on a silly hat which made everyone laugh
3319471 asking about whether the person has fallen in the last few months and whether he or she experiences difficulty or unsteadiness while moving around and if so checking blood pressure lying and standing reviewing medications and reducing the number and dose checking the person walking and etc should be part of good standard practice
3319472 across the country clearly its been a difficult headwind for the republicans
3319473 my own election i was only one of only two that got elected in 06 as a republican
3319474 it points to one fundamental point thats hard to dispute theres an enthusiasm gap
3319475 in 2004 their side was more excited than our side now our side is more excited than their side
3319476 at the end of the day would i rather have our operation or theirs i would take ours any day
3319477 the rates are much higher in baltimore than other areas of the state
3319478 there are a lot of lives to be saved by reducing cardiovascular disease you can connect the dots from high salt intake to excessive death rates in cardiovascular disease
3319479 we got criticized years ago for encouraging people not to smoke and many people argued it was a choice
3319480 but we feel that sodium consumption and hypertension are very similar to smoking in that people need to be protected from things that can harm them
3319481 if every option you have has too much salt in it you dont have much of a choice
3319482 im not saying every restaurant has this problem but if there are not enough low salt options then what kind of choice is it
3319483 this is our fountain of youth its whats kept us healthy all these years
3319484 i tell them about the health department advisory and they tell me ive been swimming here for 60 years it doesnt affect me
3319485 they say theyve developed an immunity to it over the years
3319486 almost a choke point because there is not a lot of flushing in these bodies of water
3319487 we taught all four of our children to swim here and we still take our grandchildren
3319488 pero pidi una se al de 3 000 euros y luego una primera entrega que en mi caso fue de 28 000 euros y hasta 35 000 euros para los que firmaron contrato despu s
3319489 y aprobaron estos pr stamos incluso despu s de que la empresa tuviese sentencias condenatorias por denuncias de trabajadores y proveedores desde finales de 2007
3319490 ahora estas familias est n pagando un pr stamo puente de 28 000 a 60 000 euros en algunos casos cobrados por juan ngel rodr guez l pez con pagos mensuales de hasta 1 100 euros y a cambio no tienen casa y tendr n que luchar para recuperar el dinero
3319491 seg n los datos recopilados entre varios abogados que est n en contacto con nosotros pero calculamos que podr an ser m s de 400
3319492 es dif cil asumir que pagaste ese dinero con un pr stamo puente que seg n las entidades bancarias se transformar a en hipoteca cuando tuvi semos la casa y ahora seguimos pagando los intereses y no tenemos ni el dinero ni la vivienda
3319493 la finca de cabeanca est vallada pero hablamos con varios propietarios originales de los terrenos y nos explicaron que a ellos nunca se los pagaron sino que acordaron una permuta por una vivienda con lo cual est n como nosotros porque las primeras deb an entregarse en mayo de 2008 y all no hay nada
3319494 ive heard a lot of people here at the district say things like im here to serve
3319495 it is a very emotive collection which includes this harrowing hand written account some of the details are quite shocking and brutal

3319507 ber inhalt und prozess m glicher gespr che ist strikte vertraulichkeit vereinbart daran halten wir uns
3319508 wenn die bernahme wahrscheinlich ist dann bevorzuge ich dass wir keine verbrannte erde hinterlassen
3319509 wir f hren dies auf die kombination der verschiedenen ma nahmen zur ck die im dmp f r typ 2 diabetiker vorgesehen sind
3319510 die regelm igen untersuchungstermine und die vereinbarung von therapiezielen in kombination mit schulungen und gezielten informationen f r patienten und rzte tragen m glicherweise besonders dazu bei dass gesundheitliche komplikationen und probleme bei den patienten vermieden oder schneller erkannt werden
3319511 indien ist ein extrem wichtiger markt es ist einer der am schnellsten wachsenden m rkte weltweit indien wird zunehmend wohlhabender und so werden auch die ausgaben f r gesundheit steigen
3319512 we expect these negotiations to unlock the potential of the agricultural sector so that we can effectively address development needs such as food security and rural development
3319513 we therefore expect an effective solution that will address the instability of commodity prices in the world market which continues to adversely affect the export of our commodities
3319514 the project will require at least sh5 billion to eradicate livestock disease in the country

3319518 viele interessierte haben uns auf den bremer fu ballpl tzen bei den dreharbeiten ber die schulter geschaut und sich nach dem film erkundigt jetzt sollen sie auch die m glichkeit haben das endprodukt einmal im kino sehen zu k nnen bevor er auf dvd erscheint

3319524 to be a naked long is a very insecure uncomfortable or foolhardy position
3319525 most of the time these antibodies dont do much so we thought it would be useful if we could teach them to recognise hiv
3319526 the antibodies block the interaction between virus and host cell recruit molecules that will destroy infected cells and alert killer cells that will eat them
3319527 we might be able to use the innate immune system in a surprising and intriguing way

3319531 she said thats when she knew he was tired he signalled to her that his body was tired

3319534 from north to south a rebellion is growing against those who show off their money and power
3319535 unfortunately we are fully booked you can try again tomorrow
3319536 i have nothing personally against signor roman he is an engaging and cordial person whom we had the honour of having as our guest about ten days ago the problem is that we are serious professionals and for us our customers come first if we are full we cannot just add more places we would risk compromising the quality of our service and that goes for everyone
3319537 the rules apply to everyone here residents tourists the rich
3319538 people have had enough of the ostentatious and vulgar display of wealth by footballers fashion designers starlets the champagne the ferraris the flashy watches we are looking at the end of an era
3319539 siamo partiti da zero non una campagna organizzata e non abbiamo neanche fondi degni di questo nome e una protesta popolare vera e propria viene direttamente dalla gente e questo rende tutto pi speciale
3319540 potrebbe essere un problema di lingua di accesso a internet o il fatto che i circuiti del social network non sono abbastanza estesi
3319541 credo che uno dei motivi dello scarso interesse per la campagna mostrato da molti asiatici sia dovuto al fatto che la cina una sorta di grande fratello della regione
3319542 spero che la gente guardi le nostre trasmissioni quotidiane e ascolti la voce delle persone del darfur che soffrono da tanto
3319543 noi non siamo contro il popolo cinese e le olimpiadi alcuni di noi hanno persino compassione per i leader della cina
3319544 we know that parents have tremendous influence over how many fruits and vegetables their children eat
3319545 when parents eat more fruits and vegetables so do their children when parents eat and give their children high fat snacks or soft drinks children learn these eating patterns instead
3319546 overweight children have already been exposed to salty sweet foods and learned to like them
3319547 to keep a child from becoming overweight parents need to expose them early to a variety of healthy foods and offer the foods many times
3319548 ive written one so people better go see it itll allow me to make the next one
3319549 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3319550 we are finding that breastfeeding rates arent just explained by the individuals who live in these areas theres something about the areas themselves and breastfeeding
3319551 where the need is greatest breastfeeding happens the least its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3319552 i am waiting to see the commitments they will make on issues like international justice refugees and how to address the needs of children in crisis around the world

3319560 we zullen nu alles in het werk stellen om het vertrouwen van de pati nten terug te winnen
3319561 national newspapers have poor bargaining power with advertisers due to intense competition and the rise of the internet where advertising at 19 of the uk total is the highest in the western world
3319562 the current cycle will punish johnstons local classifieds business though we see relative upside at the other end of this tunnel if regional newspapers can retain local higher priced advertising
3319563 they have made it possible for us to observe large areas of the ocean under the sea ice in winter for the first time
3319564 the sea ice causes problems for us in terms of observing the ocean in that it makes ship observation very expensive and slow
3319565 satellites cant see the ocean through the ice and the profiling floats we are using throughout the worlds oceans now are also unable to surface through the ice and transmit their data by satellite
3319566 the sea ice is important for climate because it is bright and reflects the suns energy back into space so if we have less sea ice the earth tends to absorb more energy and so warm up
3319567 weve never been able to measure how much sea ice is actually forming before and the seal data is allowing us to do that for the first time
3319568 we will be instrumenting a total of about 160 seals both in the arctic and antarctic using several different species of seal because different seals go to different places to feed so we can get information from different parts of the ocean
3319569 up until now people thought that the tasmanian mega fauna had actually gone extinct before people arrived on the island
3319570 things were very climatically stable in that part of australia and yet the mega fauna still managed to go extinct
3319571 so its down to humans of one sort or another
3319572 a lot of people still have in their minds an axe wielding spear wielding people bloodthirsty out there slaughtering all over the place it wasnt like that at all
3319573 it was basically just one joey baby kangaroo in the pot for christmas and thats all youve got to go to do to drive slow breeding species to extinction
3319574 we willen het hele systeem van bescherming van wilsonbekwame personen en goederen doorzichtiger eenvoudiger en soepeler maken
3319575 daarom stellen we voor om alles te bundelen in n overzichtelijke regeling dit zal de vrederechter toelaten om op maat van de wilsonbekwame persoon de voor hem meest passende bescherming uit te werken we behouden alle positieve punten uit de bestaande systemen en werken de tekorten weg
3319576 vanuit ethisch oogpunt moeten we vertrekken vanuit de mogelijkheden en het recht op zelfbeschikking van elke mens we moeten echter ook rekening houden met zijn handicap en kwetsbaarheid het vinden van een respectvolle en veilige bescherming vraagt een individuele en specifieke benadering vooral wat de persoon nog zelf kan doen moet aangemoedigd worden
3319577 this win has given me the confidence to go and approach big teams and show them what i can do
3319578 i think i can be a really good climbing domestique for one of the big teams and i hope to get a chance next year
3319579 i have got some irons in the fire and there are some teams i have been speaking to but i cant talk about it about the moment
3319580 weve not really lacked anything and seans name has meant weve had a better programme than a lot of teams of a similar size
3319581 i feel i can move on but dan definitely deserves it id love it if we could go to the same team but its not as if were really in the position to insist a team takes us both
3319582 i asked to be put on the whereabouts anti doping programme this year and they did that but i havent spoken to anyone about a team
3319583 dan has been told hed be in the frame but then he was told he was in the frame for the olympics too
3319584 to be honest i have to make the right decisions for myself now and if the british team comes along and theres an opportunity thatd be very interesting but i cant pin everything on that in case it doesnt happen or in case theyre not interested in me
3319585 ive made my way steadily and its better for me to keep making progress its better for me if i earn things myself id like to get something signed before the tour of britain
3319586 i used to be a mileage man but last winter i went a lot more for quality over quantity he gets me working every day each day is really specific its not just a four hour ride but it may have 20 minute intervals or five minute intervals
3319587 we have this software to quantify our training and how hard the session has been every day in the tour des pyrenees was actually easier than the training id been doing the previous week and that gave me a lot of confidence
3319588 the thing that pleased me is ive always thought of myself as a good climber ive been in hilly races but ive never been in a race which has stayed in the mountains or had a summit finish
3319589 i had a good idea i would go well but i really had to test that and prove to myself that i am that kind of rider
3319590 the team was really good the second last day i did practically nothing and on the last day i did absolutely nothing
3319591 could you get this young man some soy sauce for his meal
3319592 i dont think we want to put a mayo honey mustard blue cheese sandwich on our menu
3319593 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name

3319596 vrijdag beslissen de dagjesmensen en het weer of het druk gaat worden zaterdag is er de wissel en zal het de hele dag door druk worden
3319597 de meeste problemen zullen zich dan bij de terugkeer stellen vooral op de e40 naar de kust
3319598 onze luchthaven ontvangt normaal dagelijks een tiental vluchten maandag hadden we er vijftig
3319599 de afgeleide vluchten van brussel vertrekken elke drie minuten en dat in reeksen van vijftien daar is onze luchthaven niet op voorzien maandag hadden we 5 000 vertrekkende en aankomende passagiers tegen een duizendtal op normale dagen
3319600 dat ritme kunnen we een week aanhouden nadien moeten er meer structurele maatregelen komen maar ik hoop dat de staking in brussel niet zo lang duurt ik heb al twee dagen niet geslapen

3319604 had a problem with baby javon who would not comply with mealtime ritual by saying amen after meals
3319605 the more the queen pressed javon the more resistant he became
3319606 the queen told everyone that god was going to raise javon from the dead
3319607 the queen was able to gain the confidence of morgan who allowed the group to stay at his residence approximately one week

3319609 he was pursued by her and she saw him get on a bike

3319621 the presence of the third alternative shifts the focus of the customer if you have two automobiles extolling their fuel efficiency while a third promotes style purchasers pay more attention to the fuel efficiency criterion then when one of the high fuel efficiency cars leaves the market the other fuel efficient car draws consumers in the case of automobiles it might be fuel efficiency and in the case of political candidates it might be health care when the third choice exits the remaining candidate with the most similar attributes becomes the favourite even if they werent before

3319712 what we are telling them is get the tamils on your side by greater devolution of power for them to be part of sri lankan state they need the huge tamil minority on their side
3319713 obviously the tamil tigers have been weakened they have met with heavier casualties than previously
3319714 all signs are that they liberation tigers of tamil eelam ltte are having problems they are also hurting because of the ban in many western countries so they have problems in fund collection movement of arms

3319864 for the past 15 years my world was full of just pain and helplessness with this crippling disease all i could do was sit or lie down on my bed and take a few faltering painful steps to go to the toilet it was a very depressing state of affairs for my family and me and many times i would wonder what is the point of existing like this
3319865 i also look forward to the day when this brave girl seema is able to walk normally and go about her daily chores with ease she is a highly intelligent sensitive and caring person and deserves all the best in life
3319866 when seema first came to fortis she was bedridden and wheel chair bound and severely depressed because of her compromised quality of life at such a young age the young 37 year old lady weighed only 40 kg her case was complex because she had multiple joint involvement her bones were severely fragile and osteoporotic her joints had lost mobility and were fixed and her muscles were atomic and weak because she had been immobile for many years it was a very challenging and rare case indeed
3319867 i would like to advise anyone who is facing an equally serious situation anywhere in the world to not waste time move with a positive attitude and seek medical help wherever he or she is medical science has made tremendous strides and can be of great help do not let doubts or misgivings stop you from bringing sunshine back into your life

3319906 his family have a very strong support unit but all of them are just incredibly shocked
3319907 and just really really looking to find out more so that way we can begin planning to celebrate lees life in the correct way
3319908 theyre having a memorial in sydney but were hoping to get lees body flown to the uk to bury him here
3319909 he ran regularly it was part of his training for football
3319910 shes got a good family and friends supporting her but obviously shes very much in shock
3319911 i believe they were just about to move in together
3319912 he would have a drink occasionally at a party but i should imagine that if he was doing something like a run he would have stayed in with michelle the night before
3319913 its just a terrible shame he was a wonderful individual who is going to be greatly missed
3319914 he was such a fantastic amazing caring fun loving person
3319915 he made everyone laugh and lived his life to the full he was living his dream in oz and seemed so in love with his girlfriend its devastating that he has been taken from us
3319916 this was a string of bad luck if you like

3319929 the issue will be what level of culpability he had when that stabbing took place
3319930 i think you will find it is common ground between the prosecution and defence that the accused encountered mr fleming just outside the toilet and they then drank beer in the toilet
3319931 gerard was saying i suffer from autism i might look a bit different but i would not hurt anyone
3319932 they entrapped mr pratt into agreeing to the agreed facts
3319933 what we now suspect is that it was a set up to get mr pratt to sign an agreed statement
3319934 mr pratt was targeted for criminal investigation led into the belief that there wasnt going to be any criminal investigation
3319935 he wants to use this to advance his agenda to criminalise cartel conduct
3319936 these proceedings concern a relatively narrow matter and that is in our submission the truth or otherwise of the evidence mr pratt gave
3319937 to say we have somehow targeted his client for some unproven and presumably personal purpose is an extremely serious allegation that mr richter makes
3319938 the proposition that this is somehow a conspiracy is really well the evidence will speak for itself
3319939 is going to be available to xm subscribers on august 16 on xm 51 according to a post on metallica com
3319940 will be on the radio later this month youll also be able to download this album on
3319941 the first record 2005s all we know is falling and riot seemed to stay at the same level but now weve got some really really mellow songs that youd never expect to hear out of our band and then weve got even heavier songs than weve ever had its gonna be a little different
3319942 on the next album which the group is trying to keep at bay
3319943 riot went platinum which means weve got to beat that or at least match it and thats a hard thing to do these days
3319944 so we want to make sure we make the right record but if we dont make platinum on the next record were not gonna be all upset or anything were just gonna make a record we love if it doesnt do well theres not much we can do were just here to make music we love
3319945 expect zyrtec to go otc as a means of ensuring continued profitability
3319946 were quite upset as well this is not how we have our protocol set up with our producers
3319947 they have to deal with large scale suppliers the infrastructure of that supply mechanism has the same potential for contamination as conventional meat
3319948 we tend to look at whole foods not only as more nutritious but also safer and were willing to pay a premium for that

3319950 under glenn tiltons tenure united has gone from being the finest airline in the world with the best route structure and safety record to a shell of its former self
3319951 this is an obvious and predictable attempt to deflect attention from alpas illegal activity cited in our lawsuit which details the organized and concerted effort to harm our customers our employees and our performance and is part of the unions ongoing two year campaign to intimidate united into reopening a contract that runs through december 2009
3319952 we believe that with the intense challenges facing our industry united airlines will not be able to thrive as long as glenn tilton with his proven record of incompetence continues as ceo
3319953 were not even realizing what an incredible athlete he is
3319954 obviously hes amazing and he breaks all these world records but i think being a part of that we almost take it for granted
3319955 i want to do things that no one else in the sport has ever done
3319956 it will remain to be seen where history ultimately places him but clearly today he is the best swimmer weve seen
3319957 he was very active and never stopped moving and it was kind of hard to harness that at first
3319958 its a little bit counterintuitive because even though he was so rambunctious as a young swimmer when he raced he was very focused
3319959 i always had dreams of being an olympian being a world record holder being a professional athlete being a gold medallist and i had to focus on those goals to achieve them and i knew that
3319960 i think he missed out on a normal progression of things but i wouldnt say hes missed anything
3319961 i would say he would tell you what hes gained has been a lot better than what hes missed
3319962 i would never trade going to the olympic games and standing on top of the medal podium or being able to turn professional or travel all over the world i would never trade any of it in
3319963 there are a lot of things that people havent done and i want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things

3319967 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia
3319968 inflicted damage on operational systems troops and military facilities of georgia
3319969 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3319970 during their mop up operations in south ossetia georgian commandos have thrown hand grenades into the basements where civilians were hiding
3319971 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3319972 we must draw up a rapid calendar so that each side can go back to the positions of before the crisis
3319973 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3319974 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3319975 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3319976 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years

3319994 these changes are designed to reduce the number of unnecessary consultations under the esa so that more time and resources can be devoted to the protection of the most vulnerable species
3319995 the proposed regulations will continue to protect species while focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur the result should be a process that is less time consuming and a more effective use of our resources
3319996 draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species
3319997 as a result it is inappropriate to consult on a remote agency action involving the contribution of emissions to global warming because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3319998 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3319999 the new rules take decision making on endangered species listings out of the hands of scientists and wildlife professionals at agencies such as the u s fish and wildlife services and instead put those decisions in the hands of agencies working on projects that may be adversely affected by a listing
