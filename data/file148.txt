1480005 we are not comfortable with your firms direction and support of the gay agenda

1480013 this is a very capable 10 1 megapixel ultra zoom camera that offers a variety of very nice features including an awesome 20x wide optical zoom lens the image quality was excellent both indoors and out the one disappointment is that the performance has not gotten any better from the previous model
1480014 considering the range of the zoom lens on the sp570 uz we werent surprised to find the test camera tended to hunt at the longer focal length settings particularly in low light levels and cloudy conditions when subject contrast was reduced
1480015 up to the point when i opened the box containing the olympus sp 570 uz the canon s5 was my all time favorite long zoom digicam having now spent some time with the sp 570 thats no longer the case serious shooters looking for that mythical point and shoot digicam that adequately replaces a dslr and a bag of lenses could do much worse than the sp 570 uz
1480016 so should you buy the olympus sp 570uz or would it be best to go for a dslr well it all depends on what you want or need from a camera if your aim is to make photography your hobby prices of dslrs are so low nowadays that they would make an ideal start to what can be a fantastic pastime with the possibility to start a complete system from scratch
1480017 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time you know and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement

1480022 youd better come in your mum and dad are away visiting carol
1480023 would you like a cup of coffee or a glass of wine
1480024 and how are you and mary i hear youre retired now are you enjoying it
1480025 what brings you up here are you on your own
1480026 im on the road quite a lot travelling around and how are your family hows stephen
1480027 do you see much more of mum and dad now now that youre at home more
1480028 but not too much weve never been sort of in and out really as neighbours
1480029 when i phone its almost always mum i speak to and she seems different recently
1480030 its funny suddenly i feel about fifteen again and youre the grown up next door
1480031 i know its ridiculous oh well here goes for as long as i can remember dad has always talked about other women on tv in the street in the car if he saw a woman he liked fancied hed pass a comment especially if if she had large breasts
1480032 well mum isnt well she never has had big breasts and i think dads comments were aimed at her mainly and they worked i think she has always thought of herself as well inadequate as a woman
1480033 well when you moved in here i heard dad talking about mary your wife
1480034 well he talked about the size and shape of her breasts and how attractive they were he used to say how lucky you were being able to see marys tits whenever you wanted to and feel them and i think he used to try to spy on her he used to go upstairs a lot if she was outside and i think he was peeping out of the bedroom window hoping to see down her blouse
1480035 and i just wondered if you might have noticed anything
1480036 well shes filled out a bit your mum hasnt she
1480037 i knew there was someone and shes mentioned you a lot more than usual in the last couple of months
1480038 oh dont worry i wont shop you i i approve its doing mum no end of good and dads only got himself to blame and you dont look the worse for it either anyway i still owe you one
1480039 yes that time i was baby sitting for you and you came in and caught me with matthew hardy i was terrified youd tell dad but you never did
1480040 well your mum was unloading some shopping from the boot of her car she bent over and i saw down her t shirt and before i could stop myself i made a comment and it started from there
1480041 thats fabulous you couldnt have done better admiring her tits did she offer herself right there and then
1480042 it wasnt like that at all and im not going to tell you what it was like
1480043 carol and i arent that close and i dont share that kind of thing with alan anyway he doesnt know about matthew and me so you can still hold that over me
1480044 i mean it was obvious something had been going on but you managed to get yourselves decent before we came into the room
1480045 you see just before you came in matthew had me stripped to the waist completely and he was playing with my breasts otherwise we were both fully clothed then we heard the front door opening and there was a huge panic he grabbed my bra and stuffed it in his pocket and i pulled my sweater over my head and when i pulled my head through you were there at the lounge door
1480046 you must have been about the same age as i am now
1480047 and i was an impressionable young girl on the cusp of womanhood
1480048 hearing my dad talking about mary and you well it cast you both in a certain role in my impressionable mind
1480049 well it wasnt too close to the truth im afraid
1480050 what it did was to cast you in my mind as a very sexy man i imagined you and mary a lot i thought you must always be at it
1480051 that night i thought you had caught a glimpse of my breasts uncovered you had an expression on your face that made me think and it excited me
1480052 when i was at home in bed thinking about it i convinced myself you had seen me
1480053 and while i made love to mary you thought i might be thinking about you about making love to you instead
1480054 and i was thinking about your beautiful breasts while i was feeling hers
1480055 and what did you do while you were imagining that
1480056 ive decided to stay the night with mum and dad i think i can risk another glass
1480057 people of berlin people of the world this is our moment
1480058 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

1480077 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1480078 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive

1480086 in the past there was a negative connotation to war but its about the fact that people choose to put themselves in harms way so citizens or society can have a better life thats how were talking at it
1480087 a lot of people enjoyed it and the board decided to make it an annual event
1480088 were hoping to make the event a bit bigger this year

1480098 mothers of young children in the united states are in a rather untenable situation
1480099 mothers are so isolated in our society there is not an appreciation for the extent to which this is a very challenging time for this large population
1480100 we were surprised at how quickly the women were back to employment over 80 percent by 12 weeks postpartum
1480101 they didnt get the maternity leave that they wanted they felt they had to be back at work earlier than they wanted they werent able to achieve their breast feeding goals
1480102 they are trying to do the right thing but they are not getting the support they need in terms of time to recover and the financial support they need to be at home with their babies
1480103 there is a major awareness challenge we arent really aware of the situation that mothers are in
1480104 we need to extend the supports we have offered to mothers we need to build awareness among women that they are not alone these are common issues issues for which they can get help they are entitled to help
1480105 most women dont exist within extended families and need other forms of support because there is not an extended family that can pick up the extra responsibility
1480106 that would be very helpful in reducing the level of stress
1480107 with all the emphasis on appropriate parenting there is pressure on women to be 100 percent available which is simply not possible womens expectations have increased dramatically
1480108 especially when there is a disconnect between how one thinks a mother is supposed to behave and how grueling it actually is that sets up people for disappointment and feelings of inadequacy it does create stress
1480109 get all the support you can muster if you pay for it or recruit various family members and friends the first year in a childs life is very demanding one needs a lot of support and one also needs to take care of oneself

1480119 this is a cultural catastrophe a national tragedy there is so little of art of such level in the former soviet union you cannot put a price on this and i am not talking about money here it is in every sense priceless

1480123 why then would we prohibit our intelligence professionals from using the same words to accurately describe al qaedas stated goals
1480124 the space agencies of the world are involved in an international conspiracy to dupe the public for vast profit

1480188 economic uncertainty and high fuel prices are affecting the broad travel market and significant airline capacity reductions in the fall will also have a negative impact

1480190 actually id go so far as saying that if you consider fat32 instead of fat16 you might as well go all the way and turn it into a ntfs partition
1480191 over two hundred files when he got this error dialog
1480192 the inability to remember the explorer settings such as if you want to have every folder to have a detailed view akin to xp 2003 columns name size type date modified
1480193 thats because the previous algorithms use of cached file i o lets explorer finish writing destination files to memory and dismiss the copy dialog long before the cache managers write behind thread has actually committed the data to disk
1480194 in vista explorer also waits 12 seconds before making an estimate of the copys duration
1480195 if each point is not met do not ship windows
1480196 while vista sp1 may copy faster it seems like one cannot do anything while the system is copying
1480197 i disagree that everything has to be better in every aspect
1480198 can be slower than the original vista release in a couple of specific cases
1480199 famous it guy gives support for vista sp1 using technical lingo
1480200 biggest change they made was to go back to using cached file i o again for all file copies both local
1480201 so the new bug is that vista explorer sometimes does part of what you and i want for a short time when it shouldnt be doing that at all
1480202 its curious that 3rd party programs like total commander are capable of achieving higher speeds when copying a file than explorer exe
1480203 the time that it says its estimating the time to copy is spent copying the damn file they just dont want to give an early estimate which is likely to be way off
1480204 the bug is that i do not have photos music in every folder in the computer and atleast pre sp1 vista explorer thinks i do therefore i get the wrong column details
1480205 during windows vista development the product team revisited the copy engine to improve it for several key scenarios one of the biggest problems with the engines implementation is that for copies involving lots of data the cache manager write behind thread on the target system often cant keep up with the rate at which data is written and cached in memory that causes the data to fill up memory possibly forcing other useful code and data out and eventually the targets systems memory to become a tunnel through which all the copied data flows at a rate limited by the disk
1480206 perhaps the biggest drawback of the algorithm and the one that has caused many vista users to complain is that for copies involving a large group of files between 256kb and tens of mb in size the perceived performance of the copy can be significantly worse than on windows xp thats because the previous algorithms use of cached file i o lets explorer finish writing destination files to memory and dismiss the copy dialog long before the cache managers write behind thread has actually committed the data to disk with vistas non cached implementation explorer is forced to wait for each write operation to complete before issuing more and ultimately for all copied data to be on disk before indicating a copys completion
1480207 in vista explorer also waits 12 seconds before making an estimate of the copys duration and the estimation algorithm is sensitive to fluctuations in the copy speed both of which exacerbate user frustration with slower copies
1480208 estimation algorithm is sensitive to fluctuations in the copy speed
1480209 during vista sp1s development the product team decided to revisit the copy engine to explore ways to improve both the real and perceived performance of copy operations for the cases that suffered in the new implementation the biggest change they made was to go back to using cached file i o again for all file copies both local and remote
1480210 vistas file copy doesnt work put xps into vista sp1 makes you wonder what other components of windows they did this with
1480211 unfortunately the sp1 changes while delivering consistently better performance than previous versions of windows can be slower than the original vista release
1480212 the original vista copy engine would deliver a high speed copy but because of the out of order i o problem i mentioned earlier trigger pathologic behavior in the server 2003 cache manager that could cause all of the servers memory to be filled with copied file data the sp1 copy engine changes avoid that but because the engine issues 32kb i os instead of 60kb i os the throughput it achieves on high latency connections can approach half of what the original vista release achieved
1480213 the other case where sp1 might not perform as well as original vista is for large file copies on the same volume
1480214 one final sp1 change worth mentioning is that explorer makes copy duration estimates much sooner than the original vista release and the estimation algorithm is more accurate
1480215 file copying is not as easy as it might first appear but the product team took feedback they got from vista customers very seriously and spent hundreds of hours evaluating different approaches and tuning the final implementation to restore most copy scenarios to at least the performance of previous versions of windows
1480216 so the sp1 doesnt have any ui setting to make all folders in explorer look like they do in 2003 by default
1480217 to zzz the problem with explorer view settings changing on their own has been fixed in sp1
1480218 phew now vista can tell me in a split second that it will take two days to move a few mp3s grrrreat
1480219 so the sp1 doesnt have any ui setting to make all folders in explorer look like they do in 2003 by default
1480220 make all folders in explorer look like they do in 2003
1480221 make all folders in explorer look like they do in 2003 by default
1480222 we do need to note however that these results are extremely variable on a system to system basis due to factors such as hard drive speed and the network controller used
1480223 the time that it says its estimating the time to copy is spent copying the damn file they just dont want to give an early estimate which is likely to be way off
1480224 just can not find any free screen area to drop the files
1480225 from memory i think xp only dropped into subfolders if released over the filename
1480226 we have a unique opportunity to read about the internals of windows operating system written by one of the experts in a comprehensible way
1480227 my point is that decreasing the tendency of the kernel to swap stuff out is wrong you really dont want hundreds of megabytes of bloatyapps untouched memory floating about in the machine get it out on the disk use the memory for something useful
1480228 in 14 years of using windows pcs and servers nothing ever went wrong with the old lightning fast file copy in use prior to vista
1480229 although i agree with you that shortnames do indeed suck id argue that the bug you describe is a problem with windows shortname preservation and filename enumeration i e it shouldve been fixed at a much lower level than explorer
1480230 it cant be some callers wish that enumerations would come back sorted in some order
1480231 regardless of glob order or sort order be it alphabetical or library of congress low level file system operations between windows filesystems have to preserve short filenames consistently
1480232 i have to avoid looking at gnu source these days so that none accidentally sneaks into my work
1480233 norman diamond my point was not that gnu cp was bug free but why ms saw the need for a complex engine i dont know anyone who complains that nix file copying is too slow using cp but many many people have complained about vista in this regard although i agree with you that shortnames do indeed suck id argue that the bug you describe is a problem with windows shortname preservation and filename enumeration i e it shouldve been fixed at a much lower level than explorer then everyone gets the benefit
1480234 if youve got em by the balls their hearts and minds will follow
1480235 i dont know who signed off on a sidebar of this quality going into the vista release but whoever it was it must have been the kind of b category employee that bill gates supposedly said microsoft ought not to employ
1480236 the whole sidebar thing looks like its been polished by microsoft but developed by students its just not good enough not by a wide margin
1480237 dont call removeobjects because theres a leak in sidebar exe
1480238 1 somebody isnt checking for null after gt gt calling malloc sidebar exe should never gt gt crash
1480239 after coming all this way to a protected address space with nt that we are seeing a problem where one gadgets misfortune is affecting all the others
1480240 for clarity the example does not illustrate the handling code and the readers are responsible for doing this
1480241 mechanisms employed by the multimedia class scheduler service mmcss a feature new to windows vista
1480242 while dpcs execute with interrupts enabled they take precedence over all thread execution regardless of priority on the processor on which they run
1480243 i have noticed problems when running on an ipv4 network ipv6 drivers are enabled by default for every network adapter meaning every time you try to connect to a remote computer website vista tries using ipv6 first if your network doesnt support it this only results in wasted time
1480244 100mb networks can handle at most 12mb s so if your system is on a 100mb network you typically wont see any slowdown
1480245 unless the hostname has an aaaa record associated with it the system shouldnt use ipv6 to try and communicate with the host
1480246 games are slower overall because of all the added functionality and features in vista even with many services eyecandy and programs disabled i still find programs run better in xp and even better in linux for example bioshock runs horribly on my computer in vista with input and audio lag making it unplayable this didnt surprise me too much as my computer didnt meet the minimum specs in the cpu department but in xp it ran quite acceptably
1480247 the maximum standard ethernet frame size is about 1500 bytes
1480248 the minimum frame is 64 bytes which works out to about 164 000 frames second so throttling at 10 000 frames second will throttle the network a whole lot worse than the calculation based on 1500 byte packets
1480249 ps i have a phone running a 200 mhz arm with a piddly little os and am able to play streaming mp3s on a broadband wireless network with no hassles and a dual core 2 ghz desktop uses 41 cpu to simply copy files
1480250 why would this ugly hack be required if vista network implementation did not consume this much cpu
1480251 it seems to be a scheduling throttling issue rather than one caused by something using too much cpu the problem is that fixed magic numbers were chosen perhaps based on the worst case hardware and obviously without thinking about the requirements of gigabit networks
1480252 its refreshing to hear a valid lucid explanation of what the issue really is instead of the background
1480253 tests of mmcss during vista development showed that even with thread priority boosting heavy network traffic can cause enough long running dpcs to prevent playback threads from keeping up with their media streaming requirements resulting in glitching
1480254 i just spent x million on your education why would i want to fire you
1480255 for instance in vista the audio engine runs with a periodicity of 10 milliseconds
1480256 so it doesnt matter how much horsepower your machine has its about how many interrupts have to be processed
1480257 network dpc receive processing is among the most expensive because it includes handing packets to the tcp ip driver which can result in lengthy computation the tcp ip driver verifies each packet determines the packets protocol updates the connection state finds the receiving application and copies the received data into the applications buffers
1480258 tcp and ip checksum offload for most common network traffic offloading checksum calculation to the network adapter hardware offers a significant performance advantage by reducing the number of cpu cycles required per byte checksum calculation is the most expensive function in the networking stack
1480259 in the windows performance lab we have measured tcp throughput improvements of 19 when checksum was offloaded during network intensive workloads
1480260 one reason to load the table from the registry is to avoid hard coded values in the driver this also allows for experimenting with the table entries to find the optimal values for several representative workloads
1480261 why does it need to verify each packet one would think that can be done on the network card
1480262 god help us all if anybody tries to use vista for important stuff like medical equipment monitoring
1480263 despite even this level of throttling internet traffic even on the best broadband connection wont be affected thats because the multiplicity of intermediate connections between your system and another one on the internet fragments packets and slows down packet travel and therefore reduces the rate at which systems transfer data
1480264 if anyone would chip in it would be greatly appreciated
1480265 what is the point of contention so far it looks like the only contention is computing power then this problem should not happen on a multi core processor
1480266 the point of contention is not computing power the point of contention is making sure that every 10ms the audio buffer gets refilled the problem they noticed what that network packet arrival caused these dpcs to be created that were long running and were at a higher priority then the audio thread so the audio thread would be stalled
1480267 remember not everyone has multiple core cpus and vista was designed for everyone
1480268 secondly how can you come in with an attidude like that
1480269 i cant recall where i heard this but i thought i had read somewhere that this wasnt supposed to be hard coded and it was intended to be in the registry thats not a design problem that s an implementation problem
1480270 should they be fired over this absolutely not it was a mistake plain and simple
1480271 im sure youve made them before if not ive got a job for you i want to pay you 100k a year to invest 200k and double it what you dont want to but you never make mistakes surely you can do it
1480272 but what if that thread is swapped with a higher priority thread while irpts are disabled its a really complicated problem to solve correctly
1480273 ms or at least two ms employees in their blogs are being quite open about the fact there is a problem that needs fixing

1480325 es una sorpresa para m vine a hacer buen trabajo en los 90 minutos no estuve bien pero en pasajes del partido tuve un buen desempe o metimos el gol en ese momento pumas tuvo el mejor rendimiento colectivo
1480326 del partido ante necaxa la verdad es que nos culpamos un poco los delanteros por todas las que fallamos tuvimos el partido en las manos y no lo pudimos definir
1480327 yo en especial tuve la ltima del partido cuando desbord peralta pero cuando le peg a m me vino girando mucho la pelota no la pude bajar y el cabezazo se me fue alto pero son cosas que nos pasan a los delanteros a veces las m s f ciles se nos van

1480431 438 602 medicare patients and 115 220 tricare patients in mississippi will be affected by these cuts
1480432 payment rates are set to drop by 10 6 percent july 1 as a result of a formula that calls for cuts when spending exceeds established goals senate democratic leaders tried to advance a bill costing 19 8 billion over five years and paid for mainly by phasing out some payments to insurers the vote was 54 39 short of the three fifths majority needed
1480433 to block a bill that would have averted fee cuts for doctors who treat medicare patients
1480434 under attack from the american medical association for voting to block a bill that would have averted fee cuts for doctors who treat medicare patients the bill would have eliminated the fee cuts for the doctors by instead reducing payments to insurance companies
1480435 the bill would restore a 10 6 percent cut in pay to doctors that treat medicares elderly patients the reduction in pay also would affect doctors who treat veterans military retirees and their dependents under the pentagons tricare program which relies on medicare to pay doctors cochran and wicker objected that money to restore those cuts would be taken from payments to insurance companies under the medicare advantage plan a semi private plan used by some seniors
1480436 the senators were backed by a group of insurers americas health insurance plans
1480437 insurance companies and the white house argue that the bill would hurt beneficiaries who rely on private medicare plans
1480438 by reducing federal payments to insurance companies that offer private medicare advantage plans as an alternative to the traditional government run medicare program
1480439 theres no celebrating for the millions of seniors the disabled and military families who will lose their access to health care a group of u s senators voted to protect the powerful insurance companies at the expense of medicare patients access to doctors

1480458 i tried my best but neha kept crying all through the night and did not sleep it was only when she saw her mother that she smiled for the first time and rushed to her last night
1480459 the girl could neither say her own name or those of her parents she was not aware of her native place and looked completely shaken she kept searching for her parents and wept bitterly on being asked about her mother
1480460 we had lost all hope about her being alive we had returned home
1480461 he maintained relations with them for several weeks or months before luring them to a secluded spot and killing them he also picked up labourers who were out of work assuring them money and food and after gaining their confidence strangled them with their own clothes
1480462 he was specially brutal with some of his victims whom we suspect were sex workers
1480463 usually in the movies they say give me the money but they tried to kill us from the very start it happened really fast they ran in holding the knife out and started trying to chop me
1480464 we would never have used the gun if they werent so threatening they were frantic
1480465 whether or not he managed to hit anyone i dont know but he certainly did use the pistol
1480466 its still at an inquiry stage at the moment were still working on the robbery

1480475 we dont know where these recordings came from theyre lashing out and trying to divert people from the focus that senior national mps have been caught out telling the truth
1480476 i have absolutely no idea who the person is that was speaking to mr english and dr smith
1480477 who knows whether these tapes are actually sort of completely real they could well have been doctored no one really knows this stuff
1480478 the national party was very happy to use that particular recording at the time
1480479 caught out obviously planning not to tell the people about their true intentions
1480480 thats what you sort of do when you have been in opposition for a long time because government programmes get rolled out and get entrenched and people rely on them
1480481 look weve been very upfront with our agenda weve been talking at the weekend a lot about how to get new zealand moving again how to deliver infrastructure theres no hiddenness about the fact we wanted to use some debt to finance that theres no secret agenda we have an agenda that says we are going to do the right thing by new zealand
1480482 we want to position ourselves so that when markets turn around we can take advantage of that
1480483 the air new zealand cup remains our premier domestic competition and we want to ensure it maintains its status as a true national championship that engenders provincial pride and rewards those players that perform in their club competitions
1480484 it is our belief that these changes and the management mechanisms will deliver on those aspirations and eliminate the sustainability issues that have challenged us with the current format
1480485 some of these ideas have been suggested or promoted previously and have been well supported in some of our research with rugby fans so we are excited at the prospect of putting them into action
1480486 we are very committed to ensuring that club rugby has its own time and space as we see the regeneration of the base of the game as critical to our long term future

1480497 thats when we started writing original music we always wanted to be a band and have a name and write songs but i didnt want to force it im glad we were patient and waited for it to develop naturally youve got to be picky about your music we have to be our no 1 fans we have to write music we want to hear all the time

1480516 any life safety issues will be dealt with forthwith and there will be no students threatened at any way because of a lack at any of the three universities taking care of their deferred maintenance
1480517 that means ua isnt fixing 17 million of life safety issues

1480532 we still get back and weve been there quite a bit in recent months
1480533 i dont want to say there hasnt been some issues but the whole year has been a little left footed nothing against left footed people
1480534 i dont mean that but its been odd and moms passage certainly didnt help any of that
1480535 i think with her death brought probably back the memories of my father more than anything else the two of them and i hadnt even spoken to my brother about it and he mentioned a couple weeks ago thats the same thought he had so i think its affected me maybe more than i had anticipated
1480536 but you know those things happen unfortunately they happen good and bad things happen in your life certainly more good than bad if you want to find the bad things and blame it on that theres plenty there but im not going to say thats whats held my game back this year its just been a combination here an influence there and generally speaking its just been bad play
1480537 i was actually the receiver on the play i was a defender prior to that pass
1480538 i dont know it was just one of those things as soon as i did it in my mind i knew id really screwed it up and in my heart i was saying maybe its just cramping but it was pretty bad and it turned black and blue
1480539 i couldnt have played for three weeks i couldnt have hit a shot really with any kind of authority i tried to play and hit it maybe 200 yards with the driver and was just awful so i was pretty concerned about it and im still not 100 percent but its not too bad
1480540 i genuinely didnt think i was going to make it
1480541 i thought chad would comfortably shoot 67 or 68 but it got tougher out there with the wind then i got the call that he shot a 71 and i couldnt believe it

1480551 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1480552 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1480553 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1480554 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it
1480555 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1480556 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen

1480642 in light of the difficult economy the general decline in real estate values and uncertainty in the credit markets we are very pleased with our financial results for the first half of 2008 while many other financial institutions are reporting losses and layoffs hudson valley continues to prudently expand within our local markets we are adding qualified experienced bankers and are investing in new branch locations this expansion comes at a time when many other banks are withdrawing from the market place we believe the time is right to expand our footprint while remaining focused on our business plan which has proven successful for us in the past although the expansion comes at a short term cost we believe carefully planned growth provides a long term increase in value for our shareholders employees and the communities we serve
1480643 we are seeing signs of results for our efforts particularly in loan growth
1480644 net loans increased 205 3 million or 15 9 during the first six months of 2008 this strong loan growth led us to increase our provision for loan losses which also impacted results for the 2008 period we have maintained our prudent lending standards which to date has protected us from serious credit losses and allowed us to continue to make loans in our local communities our capital position is classified in the highest regulatory category

1480667 though it looks like we are in a recession we continue to have good realized earnings of 0 95 per diluted share which is slightly behind our previous guidance due to several exits shifting from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2008
1480668 with our visibility into additional exits of portfolio companies during the third quarter of 2008 we expect to realize earnings that cover our dividend this is evidenced by our forecast to exceed 1 05 per diluted share in realized earnings for the third quarter of 2008 despite the troubles in the economy in the second quarter we had exits and prepayments totaling 479 million our exits are accretive to noi when we redeploy the capital into wider yielding debt investments
1480669 we are pleased with the credit quality of our portfolio given the current environment
1480670 our non accrual loans were 2 of total loans at fair value as of june 30 2008 the overall portfolio has experienced ebitda declines on average signaling that we are in a recession however it is interesting to note that when the results are weighted by the fair value of our investments ebitda is growing year over year indicating that our largest investments which are primarily our buyouts are performing the best this reflects the investment discipline we had over the last five years and leads us to believe that our credit quality will remain better than during the last recession we continue to sell companies at attractive multiples generating good liquidity despite the economy we are well positioned to maintain our dividend level in our steady state operating mode
1480671 we exited eleven companies year to date through july 2008 receiving proceeds of 1 billion
1480672 the median multiples for these companies at the time of their 2008 exits were one turn higher than the median multiples when we entered into the investments and their average ebitda was 55 higher we currently have 22 companies in various stages of the sales process which is typical for the size of our portfolio we are seeing robust interest from prospective buyers so we continue to expect strong liquidity from our portfolio our ability to offer a staple financing package to buyers is a strong competitive advantage and advances our strategic initiative of increasing our investment spreads and moving up the balance sheet in this environment

1480690 our embassy in tel avivs contacts with the settler community have been with the goal of setting out the british governments view on this issue and to seek to convince them that settlements are a significant obstacle to peace but you are right that their presence at this event was not helpful and the embassy is reviewing its procedures to ensure that it does not happen in the future
1480691 as the minister states the embassy is reviewing its procedures to ensure that it does not happen in the future

1480726 he pitched his way onto the team in 2007 giving us an opportunity to acclimate him to the majors in a relief role and at the start of this season we thought his greatest value to the team in 2008 was in the bullpen
1480727 however as our season progressed and it became obvious we were not going to reach the goals we had entering this year we began internal discussions on the best time to convert brandon back to a starting role we believe that giving him time to stretch out in tacoma and then hopefully make some starts for the big league club before spending the 2008 off season preparing to come to camp as a starting pitcher for 2009 is the best route for his development

1480785 the iraqis will be aware that by meeting their scheduling needs he will expect to see saddam hussein
1480786 i have become convinced of the important role iraq can play in helping bring greater peace to the middle east
1480787 the united states strongly desires an end to the iran iraq war i have no illusions that the many differences between iraq and the united states can be easily or quickly resolved
1480788 however i am gratified that the dialogue between us laboriously and patiently nurtured has improved our understanding of each other
1480789 the united states stands ready to exchange ambassadors to make formal recognition of this fact whenever you decide that such a step will support the interests of your country until then i want you to know that i attach great importance to continuing and improving our dialogue

1480800 iraqi tv photographed saddams initial greeting of rumsfeld and presentation of president reagans letter
1480801 rumsfeld told saddam us and iraq had shared interests in preventing iranian and syrian expansion
1480802 the us had originally acted with indifference both toward syrian invasion of lebanon and toward the iran iraq war for which it decided to let this group of lunatics bash each other
1480803 what would have happened to the states of the gulf and arabian peninsula if iraq had not stood fast no one would have been able to put out the fire zionism was in fact encouraging it to burn
1480804 nations rumsfeld said were better off taking long sighted view and us had to try to take a comprehensive view our understanding of the importance of balance in the world and the region was similar to iraqs
1480805 to the extent there was excessive focus on lebanon rumsfeld continued it could distract attention from need to address more fundamental problems such as security of the gulf and circumstances of the palestinian people

1480829 weve got really capable people at apple i made tim cook coo and gave him the mac division and hes done brilliantly i mean some people say oh god if jobs got run over by a bus apple would be in trouble and you know i think it wouldnt be a party but there are really capable people at apple and the board would have some good choices about who to pick as ceo my job is to make the whole executive team good enough to be successors so thats what i try to do
1480830 my job is to not be easy on people my job is to make them better my job is to pull things together from different parts of the company and clear the ways and get the resources for the key projects and to take these great people we have and to push them and make them even better coming up with more aggressive visions of how it could be
1480831 we dont get a chance to do that many things and every one should be really excellent because this is our life life is brief and then you die you know so this is what weve chosen to do with our life we could be sitting in a monastery somewhere in japan we could be out sailing some of the executive team could be playing golf they could be running other companies and weve all chosen to do this with our lives so it better be damn good it better be worth it and we think it is
1480832 the reason is is because you cant do what you can do at apple anywhere else
1480833 theres no other company that could make a macbook air and the reason is that not only do we control the hardware but we control the operating system
1480834 our dna is as a consumer company for that individual customer whos voting thumbs up or thumbs down thats who we think about and we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience and if its not up to par its our fault plain and simply
1480835 apple is a 30 billion company yet weve got less than 30 major products
1480836 im actually as proud of many of the things we havent done as the things we have done the clearest example was when we were pressured for years to do a pda and i realized one day that 90 of the people who use a pda only take information out of it on the road they dont put information into it pretty soon cellphones are going to do that so the pda markets going to get reduced to a fraction of its current size and it wont really be sustainable so we decided not to get into it if we had gotten into it we wouldnt have had the resources to do the ipod we probably wouldnt have seen it coming
1480837 weve got 25 000 people at apple about 10 000 of them are in the stores and my job is to work with sort of the top 100 people thats what i do that doesnt mean theyre all vice presidents some of them are just key individual contributors so when a good idea comes you know part of my job is to move it around just see what different people think get people talking about it argue with people about it get ideas moving among that group of 100 people get different people together to explore different aspects of it quietly and you know just explore things
1480838 when i hire somebody really senior competence is the ante
1480839 recruiting is hard its just finding the needles in the haystack we do it ourselves and we spend a lot of time at it ive participated in the hiring of maybe 5 000 plus people in my life so i take it very seriously you cant know enough in a one hour interview so in the end its ultimately based on your gut how do i feel about this person what are they like when theyre challenged why are they here i ask everybody that why are you here the answers themselves are not what youre looking for its the meta data
1480840 when you hire really good people you have to give them a piece of the business and let them run with it
1480841 so what we do every monday is we review the whole business
1480842 we dont have a lot of process at apple but thats one of the few things we do just to all stay on the same page
1480843 at pixar when we were making toy story there came a time when we were forced to admit that the story wasnt great
1480844 we called that the story crisis and we never expected to have another one
1480845 that happens more than you think because this is not just engineering and science there is art too sometimes when youre in the middle of one of these crises youre not sure youre going to make it to the other end but weve always made it and so we have a certain degree of confidence although sometimes you wonder i think the key thing is that were not all terrified at the same time i mean we do put our heart and soul into these things
1480846 theo he is not your brother but he is your fathers son who is he

1480863 theres very few new landfills being opened and the waste that cant be recycled has to go somewhere
1480864 we cant work on the basis that government policy might change we have to work in the here and now and that is that thermal treatment is government policy

1480895 from the outset i want to acknowledge my poor judgment and culpability in having assisted timothy mcveigh
1480896 in december of 1992 timothy mcveigh told me that while he was serving in the u s army he had been recruited to carry out undercover missions

1480898 after an attempt to assassinate bin laden i went to the sudan in 1994 to train bin ladens bodyguards security detail
1480899 loved sheikh osama for he has forsaken wealth and easy life and joined jihad and the endeavor to spread islam
1480900 after we executed our operation we thought it wise to go to bin laden
1480901 we found bin laden in a chair in the garden of his house when he saw me he said angrily why did you commit such a crime that is not what we wanted
1480902 carried out gods wishes and that we were aware of all consequences
1480903 bin laden left the garden and upon entering his house shouted stop him
1480904 i knew that was an order to get rid of me so we started shooting and bin ladens guards did the same there were three iranians and an egyptian called jabr
1480905 osama bin laden went down the basement where there are hideouts i know because i used to go to the house
1480906 i was hit by ahmed the algerian a guard of bin laden i used to know in peshawar
1480907 my sheikh accused me of being a killer and god knows the truth

1480914 he was informing us about his group as a result of a change in thinking within the group
1480915 concerned about the radical and violent image of the group presented by the government
1480916 had persuaded them that u s diplomats were sincere so they decided to present this true picture directly to
1480917 redacted had told us separately that redacted had opined that the government was not persecuting the muslim brotherhood because the u s was supporting the muslim brotherhood against the more radical islamic trends on this widely accepted conspiratorial premise the islamic group may be making its own bid for outside support

1481003 during the year we re evaluated our exploration strategy in the bakken shale play based in part on the announced drilling and production results of other operators in the immediate area of our bakken shale acreage in the west central north dakota counties of mountrail dunn and mckenzie we revised our capital expenditure budget our previously announced capital expenditure budget included selling down our working interest in our bakken leasehold in order to fund a portion of our 2008 drilling program as we continued to evaluate the bakken play we revised our strategy and now intend to continue acquiring acreage while maintaining a high working interest
1481004 furthermore due to our concern about the availability of drilling pipe we have acquired and or made deposits on projected pipe requirements through the first seven wells of our program as a result of these changes in strategy our cash balances and working capital are not adequate to meet our anticipated capital expenditures as a result we will need to obtain significant additional working capital through debt or equity financings or by entering into additional joint venture agreements once we resolve our immediate capital needs we expect to begin our planned drilling program in the bakken shale play after delivery of the rig which is expected in september we expect to begin in earnest to develop our lands we have a second rig scheduled to be delivered in march 2009 as a result we continue to assemble drilling permits and are working hard to ensure that we will have a portfolio of drillable locations once the rigs arrive i look forward to updating you soon on our progress
1481005 while much of the focus in the rockies has been given to the bakken play in north dakota we are pleased that our partner in the vermillion devon energy is preparing to move two rigs onto our acreage within the next few weeks although kodiak has minimal capital expenditure requirements in this basin we expect to benefit from devons program which is projected to include up to five wells between now and year end we will update you on our progress in wyoming as we move forward

1481079 this combined with our commitment to maintaining financial flexibility and investing prudently in our long term growth has led us to take a more conservative approach to our growth and business strategy over the short term

1481110 despite these positive developments lower sales of generic apis and unfavorable product mix resulted in lower profitability compared to the same quarter last year while we maintain our previously announced 2008 sales and earnings guidance we anticipate being at the low end of the profitability range due to lower volumes for a key api
1481111 we are pleased with our results for the second quarter particularly delivering increased production over first quarter 2008 and reporting record quarterly discretionary cash flow of 180 5 million obviously the biggest new item of the quarter was the announced merger agreement with bois darc energy we remain very excited about the opportunities created by the bois darc merger and look forward to having our exploitation and exploration teams follow up on the initial bois darc efforts we now expect a closing in late august and we are very appreciative of the hard work and cooperation exhibited by both groups

1481135 on april 7th we announced a voluntary product recall of certain glass bottles of samuel adams products we completed most of the recall activities during the second quarter with the help of our wholesalers retailers and customers and appreciate the outstanding support they provided during this process in our first quarter financial results we took various charges for this recall based on the best available information at that time our estimates are now higher than previously reported as more data has become available the after tax impact of these additional provisions in the second quarter was 2 8 million we estimate that we quarantined for destruction approximately 925 000 cases of product of which 200 000 cases were held at our warehouses and identified prior to shipment to our wholesalers the full costs of this effort include drinker rebates product credits fees and incentives to wholesalers and retailers for the recall lost product freight and destruction charges for returned product warehouse and inspection fees repackaging materials pos materials and other costs we also believe that we have experienced lost sales at retail which probably contributed somewhat to the slower growth rate in depletions for the second quarter for the first six months of 2008 to reflect the current known estimated impact of this recall we reversed approximately 725 000 case equivalents of shipments which translates to approximately 12 3 million of sales credits and recorded approximately 8 3 million as recall costs the after tax impact of these provisions was 11 6 million all these amounts reflect estimates based on available information which could differ from the actual recall costs and do not reflect any potential recoveries from third parties we also believe that we replenished some of the recalled shipments in the second quarter resulting in higher shipments and revenue than would have normally been anticipated for the quarter absent the recall and any benefit from this is not included in the above provision estimates the company carries product liability insurance but does not carry product recall insurance

1481140 our overall business remains strong as we continue to benefit from our diversification adjusting for non cash mark to market charges our operating income increased in three of four segments in the second quarter in our fourth segment sulfur services margins declined as expected due to pricing lags in certain contracts and a reduction in fertilizer volumes sold due to seasonality accordingly we expect our third quarter sulfur services margins to be substantially improved for our other businesses we expect continued improvement as organic growth projects come online through the end of the year and into the first half of 2009 we recently announced our seventh consecutive quarterly distribution increase which represented a 12 1 increase over our distribution one year ago this growth has come primarily as a result of internally generated organic growth projects we continue to focus on organic growth projects as a primary driver of our growth as elevated multiples for acquisitions continue to keep us out of the market

1481334 at a time of great peril and promise war and strife we are blessed to have such a powerful reminder of mans potential for great evil but also our capacity to rise from tragedy and remake our world let our children come here and know this history so they can add their voices to proclaim never again and may we remember those who perished not only as victims but also as individuals who hoped and loved and dreamed like us and who have become symbols of the human spirit
1481335 for supporting and voting in favor of all significant darfur legislation
1481336 not actively supporting darfur related legislation and failing to consistently champion the cause co sponsoring one or two resolutions or providing a few favorable votes is not enough elected officials must continually support efforts to end the genocide in darfur

1481351 but losing a player of jamess magnitude would be nothing short of a nightmare for the nba
1481352 for the most part the league considers the players to be fungible products
1481353 but lebron is one of the three or four players the league would definitely hate to lose if a team lost him or kobe bryant to europe it would lose its mind it would be devastating
1481354 it would be disappointing to lose one of our star players but i have no concern at all about the best players playing anywhere but in the nba for a long time to come
1481355 id be surprised if one of our top players chose to go to europe but if it did happen there are many players who would step up and fill the void
1481356 first of all we dont know that theres going to be a 50 million offer

1481395 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1481396 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1481397 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1481398 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1481399 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1481400 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1481401 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1481402 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1481403 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1481405 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1481406 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1481407 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1481408 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1481409 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1481410 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case

1481435 the united states denies as a matter of law and fact that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief sought
1481436 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1481437 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1481438 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1481439 first the relative shortage of trained budgetary procurement and other staff with the necessary technical skills as a factor limiting the iraqi governments ability to plan and execute its capital spending
1481440 third violence and sectarian strife remain major obstacles to developing iraqi government capacity
1481441 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and economic needs
1481442 if there is a significant increase a major nuclear renaissance with a large number of new plants a second repository may be needed

1481445 we cannot treat our way out of this epidemic that is clear we still need a vaccine
1481446 the community is ready to do its part it is the scientists who have failed we have not figured out the right product and we still dont know what we want the product to do
1481447 the best hope of combating the hiv aids epidemic is biomedical preventive technology and the best among these would still be a vaccine
1481448 we are in an interesting and some would say difficult period
1481449 there has been a sense that every vaccine trial is do or die
1481450 most people dont understand that the product development process is rife with failures the assumption is most candidates wont work we are just looking for any signal of hope
1481451 we have to take chances you cant just stay and watch people die
1481452 we are depending on arvs but arvs dont stop hiv they just give you a longer life we have to take the chance on a vaccine because hiv is not ending it is only increasing

1481458 the servant fell on his knees before him be patient with me he begged and i will pay back everything
1481459 but when that servant went out he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii
1481460 his fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back
1481461 but he refused instead he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt
1481462 this is how my heavenly father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart

1481467 mr villepin said iran must meet the october 31st deadline that the iaea imposed or face possible sanctions
1481468 in vienna austria where the iaea is based diplomats said iran faced a sept 3 deadline to stop uranium conversion
1481469 the united nations security council has given iran until the end of august to suspend uranium enrichment
1481470 the un has set today as a final deadline for iran to suspend uranium enrichment
1481471 the iranians did not give a clear answer if they dont give a clear answer then i think we will have no choice but to begin again to prepare sanctions resolutions for the security council

1481478 home and remote workers use computers often equipped with webcams and may have lax protection in place the danger of people using a work computer for non approved use such as instant messaging chat are well documented companies should deploy technology to set a strict policy as to which programs such as chat clients can be used by their employees

1481505 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1481506 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1481507 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1481508 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1481509 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1481510 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1481511 computer hacking and identity theft pose serious risks to our commercial personal and financial security
1481512 hackers who reach into our country from abroad will find no refuge from the reach of u s criminal justice
1481513 it appears the damage occurred mostly in the northern parts of town
1481514 a lot of trees down homes that were damaged we have a couple of homes that were absolutely devastated and a lot of power outages and that type of stuff

1481527 theyre very clear theyve made a decision theyre going to continue with that decision and theyre going through the motions with these hearings

1481529 we are asking you this morning that you recommend a legislated remedy that the province adopt legislation to clearly state that the ontario health premium is an employee responsibility and not the responsibility of employers
1481530 there is no doubt that this tax would have been eliminated had it been named differently perhaps the bureaucrat salary enhancement tax
1481531 dalton mcguinty has already explicitly stated that regardless of the outcome of this review the tax will not be eliminated

1481544 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1481545 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1481546 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1481547 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1481548 the output is a very clear understanding of what the system should look like the project has developed an entire system concept and a related reference design for a future air interface this can be used as input for the standardisation process that is now starting
1481549 no one had anything to lose and therefore we could start a joint development of a new system where everyone could bring in their ideas
1481550 we started more or less from zero so everyone could gain something
1481551 our industry partners went to the lte standardisation and many organisations have taken winner results because we already achieved some consensus there these kinds of projects are supporting consensus building

1481554 it really depends on conditions in different countries and also on market needs of course
1481555 asia is still growing fast but in ten years they will also have a saturated market the need then will be to improve the capabilities of systems from an industry perspective we have to offer innovative solutions in order to stay competitive in the global market
1481556 i think we have to work hard of course but there is a good chance because we have the people the know how and the means for this kind of co operation
1481557 what industry has to do is invest in research and development in order to stay inventive
1481558 technology is always moving its always improving we can decide either to be in the group which is improving and innovating or we are not in that group i think its better to be in the group thats improving

1481597 en el marco de nuestras posibilidades vamos a apoyar a argentina
1481598 los bonos argentinos son bonos de buen prestigio los compramos porque tenemos gran confianza en los argentinos porque son buenos bonos no son basura como los de estados unidos
1481599 hemos decidido suspender el viaje a tarija porque hubo agresiones contra periodistas contra las delegaciones anticipadas de argentina y venezuela con un fascismo de las peores pocas

1481604 i am not opposed to industrialisation that is why i dont want the tatas to leave singur instead i am offering a solution let the tatas negotiate with the state government to return 400 acres forcibly acquired from unwilling poor farmers
1481605 we have already identified a patch of land opposite the automobile plant where ancillary units can easily be shifted
1481606 rest assured neither the tatas nor the state government will withdraw from there for the sake of the jobless youth of the state there will be not only one singur but many singurs to host more automobile and other manufacturing units
1481607 the psuedo champions of the farmers cause are now demanding the return of 400 acres its not possible the small car project would have to be abandoned if the portion of the land is to be given back
1481608 we are ready to honour the opposition but dont close the path to dialogue by making illogical and unacceptable demands we want discussion on realistic demands
1481609 the trinamul congress always plays its role as a responsible opposition and our demand for the return of 400 acres is quite justified
1481610 work is progressing in full swing and 75 per cent of it is over in singur the remaining work will be completed and the small car will roll out as per schedule i havent got any communication or intimation from the tatas that they will leave
1481611 la inflaci n ha estado alta empujada por los incrementos en energ ticos y otras materias primas

1481632 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1481633 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime

1481653 in the race between exploit and protection microsoft is committed to shifting the advantage to the security industry
1481654 the introduction of these new programs helps address evolving online threats and provides more practical guidance to assess and manage risk
1481655 think of it as community based defense where we commit our skills and strengths to defend beyond our boundaries to protect our common customers
1481656 the industry is reaching a point where delivering an acceptable level of security today is beyond what one company can do alone
1481657 much to my surprise though not to my partners as he believes perhaps rightly so that anything upwards of a mild breeze would get me off i came from it a lot
1481658 and then he turned the toy around and fucked me silly with it in the traditional manner
1481659 its a sound business strategy to keep prices on par with market levels
1481660 parents have come to recognize social skills more than mere niceties for everyday life are the base for raising great kids who ultimately become successful confident and happy adults
1481661 these skills which include listening being polite and knowing how to share shape how a child will be perceived by their peers teachers adults and ultimately employers
1481662 more than ever our children must get along with others to function effectively
1481663 in this age of team sports and structured play it has never been more critical for our children to master socialization skills from childrens play groups to collaboration in the classroom kids today engage in significantly more structured group activities raising the profile and the necessity for good social skills
1481664 as preschools and kindergartens turn to an increasingly academic curriculum the necessity is that children come into the classroom with basic social skills in place
1481665 additionally there are many resources for assistance in teaching academic skills however the tools and help for teaching social skills are very limited it is really up to the parents to figure it out
1481666 while parents understand the need for behavior correction it can become frustrating
1481667 especially with the added time pressures of a typical busy family schedule we dont want to spend what limited time we do have being the bad guy and constantly correcting our childrens behavior
1481668 this knowledge coupled with the recognition that raising great kids is both incredibly challenging and unbelievably rewarding prompted us to create a tool that would provide help to moms nationwide
1481669 for generations parents have used games with their preschoolers to teach academic skills like colors numbers and letters
1481670 similarly noodleboro games were created to reinforce social skills they are designed to give parents a helping hand when it comes to raising great kids by making social skill learning a little bit easier and a lot more fun

1481673 there are the first signs of recovery from a very low base
1481674 the defendants then used these cards to withdraw tens of thousands of dollars at a time from atms
1481675 identity theft can involve a single criminal stealing the personal financial information of a single victim or as it did here it can involve a group of criminals stealing the credit card numbers of millions of people many of whom may not even learn that they were victims for months or years
1481676 identity theft victims suffer well beyond the immediate financial costs they suffer lost confidence in their privacy and security as well as the emotional strain and the time it can take to repair damaged financial lives and credit histories in many cases the effects of these crimes can be felt for years after they are committed
1481677 we have been working with countries around the world to identify and address technical vulnerabilities in computer networks and to ensure that laws and procedures are adequate to deal with these kinds of crime
1481678 and we have been working closely with our international partners to crack specific cases when they take us beyond our borders
1481679 our flight lh4853 was parked with the brake on when another aircraft came by and just touched the tip of the wing
1481680 no one was hurt and all the passengers are now safely back in the terminal
1481681 this happens hundreds of times a year at airports around the world it is very costly and is such a regular occurrence that insurance companies refuse to cover such incidents

1481687 people should consider the virus as being established in these areas for the summer
1481688 we are continuing to find virus in new areas the warm wet summer is continuing to support mosquito populations and allowing the virus to spread
1481689 the introduction of these new programs helps address evolving online threats and provides more practical guidance to assess and manage risk
1481690 in the race between exploit and protection microsoft is committed to shifting the advantage to the security industry the microsoft active protections program gives security software providers the information and resources they need to help better protect customers
1481691 as security threats become more sophisticated the global security community must combine its resources and work together to provide maximum security protections to worldwide internet users
1481692 no one organization can counter online attacks alone therefore we must use the combined strength of the industry partners customers and public organizations to build a more secure environment for everyone
1481693 we have gone from the sublime to the ridiculous in going from a final to losing in the qualifying stage
1481694 but it has happened it is thoroughly disappointing but if we had gone through we could have counted ourselves fortunate because our level of performance was nowhere near what it reached last season
1481695 a lot of the players were believing their own publicity from last season and they did not work as hard as they did back then
1481696 the problem is that dopey guys with no clue whove maybe been to an s amp m club once try and do this lack of experience is still a problem im a one man focus group this is my native sexuality i know what my crowd likes what they dont like and what they think looks and feels authentic
1481697 what the bdsm audience doesnt like is an attempt to get their money
1481698 someone who dresses a girl in a collar and a leash and sticks that on a box cover and it contains maybe two seconds of something fetishy well the audience just pukes that up
1481699 you can direct somebody dressed in latex but its a lot more than that
1481700 you have to be on the inside to know what the consumer wants to see
1481701 i also do a thing on niteflirt com thats phone sex and thats really given me a lot of ideas theyll tell me what theyre into and im like holy shit i wouldnt have thought of that on my own
1481702 its like going to the same high school or something and its similar with the fans fetish people tend to be more loyal the fetish guys will like me when im 40 and they feel that way about their product
1481703 the s amp m audience tends to be people with a high iq
1481704 theyre not easily sold on a bunch of poseur bullshit
1481705 i think the fetish world both on and off the internet will be fine because its such a specific thing
1481706 theres nothing vanilla about fetish in straight porn whose stuff really stands out when they use the same people doing the same sex acts and the only way to differentiate yourself is to beat the girl up or shove 12 things up her butt and make it the most nonsexual anti female product that you can distribute
1481707 and i tell them what i want and the slave will tell me what his or her boundaries are and then ill push them during the scene to take them to the edge we have a safety word to signal if things are going too far there is no safety word in straight porn in the fetish world theres no anti female no one is thinking of a girl in the i hate you way the master loves his girl he doesnt want to break her so she cant work the next day or put her in a mental institution because of what hes doing to her
1481708 i think the more mainstream you get unless youre a big star the way you get treated is a little bit worse
1481709 in the fetish world you never disrespect anybody you can be choking someone and if they say the safe word you stop even if youre two seconds from coming you dont want them to be hurt or damaged or bruised theres a code of ethics in the community filming or otherwise
1481710 it concerns me that there are people making these movies that do not have that experience or are not willing to pay for it
1481711 there are certain kinds of ethics in bondage particularly with people that are new to it where we need to explain everything were going to do show them every piece of equipment were going to use show them that its going to be safe and comfortable and ask them how they are with it and if theyre uncomfortable we dont do it there are a million options when youre shooting bondage there are alternatives to doing the gag if its something they dont want to do
1481712 i believe fully that bdsm is female empowerment if you use it as such
1481713 im absolutely flattered and genuinely grateful for this cover and spread
1481714 penthouse is truly an amazing magazine and im honored to be part of it
1481715 our current focus is on restructuring sexbankroll as a company auditing identifying and improving our existing business model

1481719 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1481720 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1481721 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1481722 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1481723 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1481724 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1481725 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1481726 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1481727 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1481728 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1481729 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1481730 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1481731 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1481732 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1481733 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1481734 tell that to thomas who received a citation in the mail after a south african traffic camera nabbed his vw polo
1481735 evidently someone went online and saw that i had been making contributions to obama
1481736 unless you are willing to recant that and swear allegiance to the party nominee john mccain we are compelled to request your resignation from the republican committee
1481737 as a prominent republican you should think of our partys interests and put them above personal interests
1481738 if you cant be loyal that might be best for all concerned we shook hands and he did
1481739 i think people do expect committee people in particular to be loyal to the party
1481740 mr ting has been a very loyal republican and has carried water for the party on a number of occasions
1481741 i guess the republican party in delaware in particular feels a little on the defensive
1481742 he is a law teacher like me we went to the same law school and basically he thinks it is a mistake to be so engaged in iraq when we should be focused on

1481745 we hope to launch operations in these regions in next two months preparations are on towards this including creating branch network distribution channels and sales points it is a matter of time for us to make it big in these regions as we have done in the southern region
1481746 we are probably the only dth player in the asian region to have roped in over one million plus customers in a short span six months since its launch we want to replicate the success in these regions
1481747 our strength lies in offering different packages for different segment of people unlike others ours is a common man product which comes with a right packaging at right cost the packaging will be unique and the pricing will also be equally unique
1481748 if you see me walking the road with someone else it is not because i like that persons company it is because you were not brave enough to walk beside me if you hear me talking about that person all the time it is not because that person pleases me it is because you were too deaf to hear my heart beats if you feel me falling with sopmeone new it is not because i love that person it is because you were not there to catch me as i fall

1481753 while these networks have provided immense value for the growing transitioning space they are all controlled now by venture capitalists which tend to have as their primary objective a sale
1481754 aside from the hit shows which have spawned the networks most of the other shows on these networks have not lived up to their predecessors content wise and new shows are often canceled soon after they are launched
1481755 instead of gaining capital to burn while continuing to build or seek an advertising solution we now have one of the most prominent advertising solutions out there
1481756 along with increased distribution a road map for expansion and a guarantee that i believe is an unprecedented deal for this space
1481757 inflation has been high spurred by earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1481758 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1481759 this thursday and friday there will be a bunch of folks down from redmond for a symposium to share details about our respective technologies

1481761 by using a model so conventionally sexy they dodge the question of why the kink itself is sexy
1481762 could end up creating the wrong incentives for consumers to scale back their use of internet applications over broadband networks
1481763 ive been pleased so far with the tone and substance of these conversations which have helped me to better understand the underlying motivation and rationale for the network management decisions facing comcast and the unique characteristics of cable broadband architecture
1481764 and as we said a few weeks ago their commitment to a protocol agnostic approach to network management is a step in the right direction

1481774 the question wasnt so much whether they were monitoring it or how they were its the way they went about using that information
1481775 they thought perhaps the monitoring had to be done because there were some form of threats

1481778 a lot of work has culminated in one great two hour moment that everybody else sees

1481781 most 16 year olds arent in cemeteries all the time
1481782 ive been looking for a long time to get the younger ones involved and all of a sudden it dawned on me i think ryan would be a great historian for the village
1481783 he and i didnt really know what the job of the village historian was and hes been going off to montgomery county meetings and fulton county meetings and hes taking the role seriously
1481784 they might have been in the civil war the war of 1812 theres a few revolutionary war veterans here
1481785 i went to census records first and found a w w d parsons living in fultonville

1481787 wir sind jetzt definitiv st rker als damals diese mannschaft hat genug talent um gold zu gewinnen
1481788 i think the best part is being able to be with a new group of people and getting to know them
1481789 we dont need to be as reliant on technology as we think we need to be
1481790 instead of listening to music we have to find our own ways to make music

1481805 how are our governmental relations with spain do you happen to know
1481806 hello and welcome to your spacious new living quarters this fully furnished apartment features a master bedroom two walk in closets two full bathrooms and direct outdoor access
1481807 wait a minute we waited six hours and now you tell us there is no crew
1481808 i wanted to see what would happen if you put a really high powered engine in a chassis
1481809 we picked up monday morning at a very high level it was the same level we came out of spring training what that tells you is they worked really hard in the summer in their 7 on 7 and their team pass drills they do
1481810 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time you know and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1481811 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1481812 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1481813 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1481814 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1481815 it gives us the way to see how we look at all our players
1481816 thats how we knew we wanted to get chiles the ball in the nfl they have several kind of board the big board has no reguard to position its just about who you would take first who you would take second so thats what we did
1481817 increasing preference for the use of digital media channels to discover information build knowledge and share insights
1481818 im just trying to stop a process in which there are no answers and theres no way to get answers
1481819 given the unusual rules of the u s senate we believe todays vote was actually a positive step forward in the passage of this bill which would create a qualified federal shield law that restricts the federal governments ability to subpoena journalists
1481820 but the secret service man said that didnt matter and that i would have to go
1481821 beyond a shadow of a doubt race had nothing to do with it
1481822 hands down the best 19 year old surfer in the world
1481823 when i first met clay i noticed that his personality and demeanor completely transformed in the ocean he literally came alive in the water
1481824 it was also clear that clay was quite misunderstood in the surf world and the mission of the film was to show the side that only those closest to him could see
1481825 this movie will inspire people to live in the moment and to always take the time to look a little deeper people are amazing and you never know what is behind their eyes
1481826 it feels so much different in the water i feel like im at home
1481827 the methodical and calculated steps these extremists took showed blatant disregard for the safety and welfare of our community
1481828 this reward is an important first step toward bringing those involved to justice
1481829 you kind of hope it didnt happen because it ends up being someone getting what they wanted after doing every possible thing ethically they could do wrong
1481830 i was in that clubhouse after that and the change in atmosphere was palpable and i dont think you can put a price tag on that
1481831 i cant think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in afghanistan
1481832 i went out of my house to bring drinking water our neighbor the major was standing near our gate he put his hand over my mouth and took me away in his car i was scared they carried me to a half dark room
1481833 afghan children are in a really bad situation its not just the uneducated and brutal people who abuse children but there are cases where well know people are involved in abusing children
1481834 the situation is getting more critical every day the government must not be quiet and must do its best to stop this problem law must be enforced equally on everyone
1481835 such crimes have increased so much that even children are raped there is no pity nor any sense these incidents show that the government is very weak
1481836 the courts take bribes the attorney offices take bribes and there is no one to ask about all this for this reason there are killings rapes thefts and everything else there is no government in reality
1481837 now it looks like that could be still be another couple of months off

1481842 y debemos estar muy tranquilos porque es la mayor tutela y tranquilidad que pueden tener los ciudadanos porque tenemos un poder judicial que funciona bien y que ya ha emprendido acciones para investigar todos los hechos que se produjeron no s lo la autor a de de juana sino si hay otras personas que hayan podido incurrir tambi n en un delito de enaltecimiento del terrorismo eso es lo m s importante y a lo que nos tenemos que atener

1481848 mom and dad say i should make my life an example of the principles i believe in but every time i do they tell me to stop it
1481849 this is a massacre and the only one to blame is president evo morales
1481850 the government is guaranteeing a new pension law which will be universal for all bolivian men and women a law which will eliminate the afps administrators of pension funds we are going to improve the cobs proposal
1481851 i know that some sectors of the cob are the best instruments of the empire of north american imperialism
1481852 these votes were organized by the countrys right wing politicians and business elite to perpetuate neoliberal policies resist the redistribution of land and natural gas wealth and weaken the morales government though the right points to these victories at the ballot box as proof of their mandate the referendums are not legally recognized by the bolivian electoral court the organization of american states the european union president morales or other major leaders throughout the region
1481853 a morales victory that beats his 2005 election would have a huge political impact reinvigorating his political momentum after a year in which it has been almost completely stalled by demands for regional autonomy and open conflict over a new constitution and demands by sucre to have it declared bolivias capital it would also likely jump start a new effort to bring the embattled mas drafted constitution to a national vote a move bitterly opposed by mas opponents the proposed constitution would allow morales to stand for re election in 2010 something he is currently unable to do

1481857 the radio alarm clock with a digital readout instead of a clock face changed forever the fragile state between sleeping and waking
1481858 the conditions were average this morning but the swell had got better by the time i paddled out and i was able to catch a couple of good waves its my third time here and i usually feel good in newquay so i will take it heat by heat
1481859 i am here for the whole leg and hope i can get points and dollars
1481860 i want to enjoy and keep the pressure away so i will be relaxed and hoping for this wet weather to change as long as we have waves it will be fun
1481861 i am stoked to get back to competition with this win
1481862 i pulled back from the tour to study but was looking forward to summer holidays to put a contest rashguard back on and see if my surfing was not too bad i havent trained this year but appearently it is still there
1481863 i feel at home here and i have been training hard
1481864 the waves got better with the tide going out and i was able to get some good opening ones i am happy i surfed well and that kind of scores is a confidence boost especially in such a big event
1481865 i feel like i am fit and in good form at the moment
1481866 i have been on tour for some years now and started off the year well so it is good for my confidence i am focused on the regional ratings and it would mean a lot to get an asp european crown
1481867 process transparency is the catchphrase ive used throughout accelerate and its become our guiding principle
1481868 from the dublin rehearsals up through streaming the album pre release to the various websites weve launched enabling participation weve chosen to flip the tables and make our process visible to the world this demystifies without crushing mystery or steering focus creativity exists within all of us at the same time its mercurial we all know that technology allows r e m to share how we do it it feels more real more honest more immediate its where im at now we all are
1481869 step by step weve been getting closer to arsenal and well be going out with great confidence on thursday
1481870 in the past weve been hard to beat but lacked a killer instinct in the final third thats changing now and were going out expecting to win every game
1481871 weve done that throughout pre season which been excellent apart from injuries and wed love to kick the campaign off by winning the first trophy of the season
1481872 well miss liannes goals sanderson hit over 40 in each of the last two seasons but may miss anita more because in my opinion shes the best defender in the british isles
1481873 weve brought some exciting new players in though and hopefully well be just as strong and after losing to everton in the league cup final well definitely be aiming to lift that community shield
1481874 you dont hear me being disrespectful to others on here
1481875 shame yves a was right you are a group of self rightous dishonest individuals
1481876 he was ranting about a lot of things and what exactly he was saying i have yet to confirm with investigators
1481877 people all over the world are being killed in war and now it is the people in the united states turn to be killed
1481878 guys were walking down the sidewalk and the guy just came up and ran them over the guy went crazy
1481879 we have heard in talking with some people that he often mentioned being of arab descent and were following up on that
1481880 clearly stated that he had acted alone without any help from anyone else
1481881 he did however make statements expressing his sympathy for osama bin laden and the events which occurred september 11 2001
1481882 he was very much a loner from his actions we can assume he was a troubled young man
1481883 who is unknown to the community and who reportedly has a troubled background
1481884 there is no indication of any terrorism connection in this matter right now but again we also cant discount that until we know more
1481885 we know that he has had what i would call emotional difficulties in the past
1481886 there is certainly no evidence at this point which points to any other kind of motivation other than his personal problems
1481887 feminists who have ruined my life i have decided to put an end to those viragos
1481888 he was a good kid never got in trouble never gang related that i know and ive known him since birth he was always a good kid that you would love to talk to and to meet
1481889 this is not a whodunit this is a why it was done

1481928 a prequel to a spin off of a sequel to a remake
1481929 one of the definite advantages of making a prequel is that you know exactly what is at the end of the road but the fun in this instance is to explore the scorpion kings formative years
1481930 with this film we have been able to enrich the character show his origins illustrate the events that changed his life and put him on course to become the scorpion king it is an original yet classic tale of a brave character surrounded by a band of misfits fighting against huge odds for what he believes
1481931 these films take you on a ride of action and horror but with a sort of smile on your face they are fast original and full of surprising twists and turns there is no map when you go into one of these films so you come out with your hair tussled but that is what makes for all the fun
1481932 it raises the made for dvd bar to the next level with production values that deliver theatrical style action adventure and excitement
1481933 we were determined that this had to be the girl fight to end all girl fights
1481934 given the amount of action in this film we would really have been hampered if we had to use stunt players for all of the fight scenes
1481935 my best moment was when i met michael copon and saw how quickly he picked up the choreography because i knew immediately that everything would go well on this film
1481936 fortunately i have done a lot of fight choreography and dancing and was able to pick it up quickly
1481937 learning how to intertwine butterfly kicks with a heavy sword in my hand was just the most difficult thing
1481938 the sword of damocles is an amazingly beautiful looking sword but is super heavy probably a good 35 pounds of metal and swinging it over my head and around and around was really heavy going
1481939 there is a lot that goes into the fight sequences and they are technically difficult
1481940 you have to practice the choreography and get things down so that you can sell it so that it does look good on film
1481941 i dont find myself in the fight scenes having to hold back because we have walked through the sequences and rehearsed them well
1481942 what is fun for me is trying to make it look real without people on wires flying around
1481943 heart stopping full throttle thrill ride bone crushing excitement and non stop action pulse pounding action highly anticipated

1481953 im disappointed because im hurt i got left hand hurt and my right hand i know im going to get suspended but not like for five days maybe three or two games i agree with that but five games i think is a lot
1481954 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1481955 this is my 20 something year in the big leagues and i still dont understand what common sense they have when they make those decisions
1481956 i thought i might get suspended but i wasnt sure for how long
1481957 five days is a long time i was surprised it was that for that long still everything is in the beginning stages im not an expert on it
1481958 he didnt really try to fight olivo really or anyone

1481967 for more than 150 years republicans have met every four years to adopt a platform that outlines the principles and policies upon which the party stands we are proud that the development of the 2008 republican party platform will be more interactive inclusive and open than any other in political history
1481968 we are seeking the most input through this historic opportunity to use a 24 hour seven day a week internet town hall
1481969 we know washington is not a place for solutions so we are reaching out across the nation to create a forward looking platform rooted in our core values with solutions that create prosperity today and for the next generation
1481970 we are excited that this process will facilitate greater transparency and participation in the development of the 2008 republican party platform than ever before this process will allow voters to provide input on a variety of issues important to the american people creating an account on

1481981 my father and i were pleased to have an opportunity to meet and visit with sen
1481982 my father told the senator of the time he met his father on a trip to vietnam during the war when admiral mccain was the commander in chief of the pacific theater and john was being held as a prisoner of war
1481983 we had an opportunity to pray for the senator and his family and for gods will to be done in this upcoming election
1481984 the responsibility of men and women of faith everywhere to vote and to be involved in the political process
1481985 when applying the law the role of judges is not to impose their own view as to the best policy choices for society but to faithfully and accurately determine the policy choices already made by the people and embodied in the law
1481986 the judicial role is necessarily limited and one that requires restraint and humility
1481987 the empathy to understand what its like to be poor or african american or gay or disabled or old and thats the criteria by which im going to be selecting my judges
1481988 ive seen an extraordinarily consistent attitude on the part of judge alito that does not uphold the traditional role of the supreme court as a bastion of equality and justice for united states citizens
1481989 draw down in a deliberate fashion in consultation with the iraqi government at a pace that is determined in consultation with general petraeus

1481995 no s qu decir lo que la gente quiere es una cosa y la realidad es otra
1481996 people are going to be able to get on a delta airline and on 330 planes before were done on over a thousand flights a day open up their laptop and be able to access the internet every time were above 10 000 feet
1481997 most of us work on our laptops and the ability to continue to do that on the airplane especially with the delays that some airlines have been having that would be fantastic
1481998 people will not have access to their cell phone and that is very much at the request of our passengers

1482001 how aware is the public that mccain has raised seven children or that he adopted his two oldest sons as small boys children from his wifes prior marriage or that he has raised a bangladeshi girl with severe health problems adopted from mother theresas orphanage or that his own sons have served in the military including in iraq mccain never brought up his own sons service in some of the roughest areas of iraq his principled refusal of political advantage from his sons iraq service extends to refusal even to be interviewed on the subject or to introduce his son to campaign audiences the contrast with other politicians couldnt be more stark how many candidates have we heard try to score political points as they crow in the public limelight about their own brief military stints or their wifes cancer sons car accident or sisters death from smoking the contrast is consistent with mccains internalizing the codes of honor and military conduct since his youth the veneration of courage and resilience the expectation of fidelity to principles of honor the homage paid to americans who sacrificed for their country the nobility of service and sacrifice the expectation that one would prove worthy of the countrys trust and the humility that comes from recognizing that there are causes and people greater than oneself it is in short a contrast in character character matters in a president and particularly in a commander in chief that kind of character arguably counts more than any particular political orientation or policy from character flows leadership as it is character which dictates morally grounded direction and engenders public trust character is critical to determining how a leader will respond to crisis will he reach deep within himself and in the traditions that shaped him and find the courage and grace to inspire strength and greatness will soldiers trust the wisdom and integrity of his decision when he orders them to war will he truly understand the terrible toll of war as well as the price of appeasement will he make decisions based on considerations greater than cheap political expediency now ask yourself which candidate has repeatedly demonstrated that kind of character

1482025 the political outsider has tapped into a strong current of dissatisfaction with traditional partisan politics
1482026 jim ogonowski has run an excellent and independent campaign that relies on the connections he has made with grass roots supporters throughout the district not his connections with washington politicians and special interests
1482027 the washington special interests are keeping her struggling campaign afloat and you can bet that her loyalty will be to the insiders who paid for her campaign and not to the people in this district

1482034 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1482035 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing

1482061 ecco la verit su an espulsa perch i la russa mi odiano e poi la loro amicizia con ligresti
1482062 la commissione centrale di garanzia e dei probiviri prendendo atto e condividendo la motivazione della richiesta in questo senso presentata proprio dal presidente della federazione ha decretato lespulsione dal partito della silvia ferretto
1482063 non c mai stata una riunione dei probiviri la ferretto non mai stata espulsa da noi
1482064 e dall80 che sono nel partito e ora vengo espulsa tramite comunicato stampa e inconcepibile
1482065 sono stata cacciata solo perch ho battuto il fratello del reggente romano la russa per due volte
1482066 i didnt like the way i played the majors obviously last year
1482067 and it would mean a lot to me to certainly win an open championship as well as the pga
1482068 we talked about everything that has happened since this whole process started
1482069 we rehashed all the different things thats gone on we agreed and disagreed our whole focus was was he a member of our football team and where was his mind at he was not at the proper mindset to be part of our football team
1482070 i understand the attention he gets for being in his position i think that he has the tools mentally physically emotionally whos had better training than aaron rodgers in being an nfl qb i believe in aaron because hes very talented
1482071 its just a bad time to have to go through something like this
1482072 ive closed a few games before so that definitely helps did it a little bit in college
1482073 both salazar and perlmutter have voted much further to the left than either one of those districts
1482074 they are trying to project a moderate image but they are much more liberal
1482075 because perlmutter won substantially last year 08 doesnt look like a great republican year
1482076 but i think if the republicans can find the right candidate they can make it competitive if not now then in 2010
1482077 these candidates are moderate and the democrats strength is finding moderates in fact salazar is a flat out conservative
1482078 but its not ideological or think tank conservatism its main street or natural resource conservatism
1482079 i do not hear a lot of dissatisfaction with salazar
1482080 the only conceivable way to give him a hard time would be to import massive amounts of money money would be the key
1482081 is on its way to the governors desk and when it lands on her desk she will sign it into law
1482082 this bill gives us another option in addition to our dnc approved caucus when this bill becomes law we will weigh our options and decide how to proceed
1482083 if floridas any indication michigan will lose its delegates if they move to jan 15
1482084 we hope that they will continue with their plan that complies with the rules
1482085 every one of the more than 4 25 million registered democratic voters in florida will be completely disenfranchised and their constitutional rights with respect to that election will be eviscerated
1482086 about the right of every american to have access to the ballot box the right of every american to have their ballot counted and to have it counted as intended
1482087 blacks and other minorities in florida have long faced discrimination at the polls
1482088 i would have hoped that we in florida wouldnt still be talking about preserving ones right to vote 42 years after the passage of the voting rights act
1482089 wisconsin cannot constitutionally compel the national party to seat a delegation chosen in a way that violates the partys rules
1482090 after eighteen years in public service starting in 1989 in the first bush administration then on senator lotts staff and most recently as a member of the house it is time for me to gain new experiences in the private arena
1482091 i am not saying a final farewell but hopefully simply taking a leave of absence
1482092 markey benefits a lot from her salazar ties and his political reputation as a centrist
1482093 i believe she has made a shift toward the center image wise but her voting has not changed
1482094 it was recognizing that after the last election voters wanted to see her as a more active presence in the district and the congresswoman had the humility to respond in a positive way
1482095 this notion of scandal which you saw the momentum begin to develop in 2006 is a tropical depression that has developed into a full fledged hurricane youve got various versions of it whether its money or social morality issues that have plagued vitter and now craig they kind of pile upon each other
1482096 john doolittle is determined to run for re election and be victorious in november 2008 his activities during the august recess have increased his desire to do that hes doing everything in his effort to represent his constituents and with that run for re election in 2008 he is more determined than ever
1482097 i am seriously considering running for the 4th congressional district and i am very concerned about congressman john doolittles ability to get re elected
1482098 i needed to be out in both counties more and listen to them
1482099 a political activist poet journalist essayist hip hop historian public speaker and entrepreneur
1482100 widely considered one of americas most important voices in these early years of the 21st century
1482101 desire to become president has surpassed his ability to support progressive values
1482102 kuhl has voted in virtual lockstep and has reversed his votes to obey the president of united states
1482103 whenever the president threatens the veto he is in lockstep with the president
1482104 at the end of the day it is his election to lose
1482105 eric massa is coming on strong and has this extra support
1482106 every once in a while democrats will try to take a big run at us
1482107 once all of the votes are in we will make an assessment about whether further action is appropriate
1482108 ignoring the letter and spirit of the federal election law for his own political benefit
1482109 up to this point no one has taken the time to take action against this abuse i hope that the fec will act quickly on this issue
1482110 one cant help but see that thompson again might be hearing the call to serve as he discussed less than six months ago a door is opening and this time fred dalton thompson may lead all of america through it
1482111 my position on same sex marriage has not changed i believe strongly in civil unions
1482112 doma provided great protection against the republican strategy to cynically use marriage as a political tool
1482113 i dont see this as an issue of science or definition i see gays and lesbians as people i dont like to answer definitions like that that are grounded in science or something else that i dont understand
1482114 every one of us taking a stand has the potential to help any one of us evolve thats the gift we give to each other
1482115 to change my status as a voter and register as unaffiliated with any political party
1482116 although my plans for the future havent changed i believe this brings my affiliation into alignment with how i have led and will continue to lead our city
1482117 are more political and less issue based than i think ever before and the consequences have been disastrous for us
1482118 inaction and partisan gridlock are destroying our relationships and reputation around the world
1482119 i like the way it looks that its continuous said ebert a home depot cashier
1482120 we waited until 2008 because i like eight otherwise we would have gotten married earlier
1482121 the consequence could be that a citizen could bring some sort of legal action to stop them from doing it
1482122 right now as a county commissioner i get what all the employees get
1482123 its not like i was asking them to give me the 200 bucks a month
1482124 if i try to buy an individual policy with preexisting health conditions i couldnt do it
1482125 if its illegal the department of justice has to stop it or get the legislature to pass a law and make it legal
1482126 it always sort of bugged me that they thought they were better than every other political official in north carolina
1482127 it may have little to do with the real sports but we get peoples heart rates up to 140 to 150 beats per minute although some of that may just be the excitement of the game
1482128 we think of this as just another tool at the gym
1482129 i use it in what we call active recovery time during which normally i would have them do a wall sit
1482130 when you envision someone playing videogames you get a vision of some kid zoned out or you get the picture of that slacker in his moms basement
1482131 i decided to give it a try to break up the monotony i just felt like i was in a rut but i was not really prepared it kicked my ass
1482132 a lot of users seem to feel that gta iv went to the realistic gameplay and lost a lot of the fun experiences from games like san andreas
1482133 the encouraging thing is that a lot of people seem to be in favour of saints row
1482134 san andreas is one of my favourite games and vice city was a lot of fun too just the whacky sic activities you got up to the fast paced action
1482135 they really slowed it down for this one its an awesome environment but i think they lost a lot of fun factor weve seen that on a lot of forums
1482136 its been months since it came out and multiplayers kind of held on to that there are still some things you can go back and do like the hitman stuff theres some racing activities you can do you can shoot pigeons if you want but beyond that theres not that much replayability
1482137 we wanted to add co op all this different missions diversions youre just getting rewarded for playing the game thats what we feel is the defining factor of saints row
1482138 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1482139 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1482140 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1482141 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1482142 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1482143 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1482144 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1482145 who has a realistic chance of becoming president of the united states
1482146 from the day i take office as president of the united states
1482147 if i have the opportunity to lead this nation i will always be a president who hears your voice and understands your concerns a president whose story is like so many of your own whose lifes work has been the unfinished work of our long march toward justice
1482148 and i will stand up for you and fight for you and wake up every single day thinking about how to make your lives better
1482149 hes one of us already or i think we feel hes one of us already so he doesnt have to go to the great extents that somebody whos not african american would have to go
1482150 when you talk to a black democrat today its basically either clinton or obama nobody else gets hardly any votes at all
1482151 so theyre conflicted and at the moment hillary clinton is winning out
1482152 the obama campaign has the most expansive and the most effective ground organization of all the candidates democratic and republican in south carolina and this is touching every single voter of every demographic
1482153 the numbers said among potential support barrack obamas doing pretty well in south carolina and compared to the way he was doing earlier he has come a long way but strategically hillarys got a lot more places to go
1482154 clearly the clinton name has been a major force in democratic politics over the last 20 years and so clearly among democrats overall there is perhaps a greater familiarity but what were finding is that when voters have opportunities to learn more about sen obama to hear him speak to learn more about record they find he really and truly offers the type of leadership thats necessary to bring the fundamental change that theyre so desperately seeking
1482155 bold straightforward way that they connect with the african american community
1482156 some people in the black community are uncomfortable with him because culturally he doesnt sort of line up as a traditional african american and doesnt sort of present the issues that they care strongly about as powerfully as they would like for him to
1482157 if i was his campaign manager i would be saying look barack your vote is in the white community
1482158 so you can only go so far in the outreach to black voters
1482159 im going to fight for the ideas that will get our country back on track ideas like beginning a responsible end to the war in iraq controlling our spending and fixing our health care system
1482160 i think these are the mark of a competent government the kind of government that i want representing my family and yours
1482161 there were still too many people who didnt know enough about me
1482162 so i want to remedy that by getting an earlier start i think to do better we need to start earlier so that we can get that message out earlier
1482163 accessible to everyone and affordable to everyone be it through a single payer plan or some hybrid between that a market based approach
1482164 but youve got to make sure that everybody has health care its better for our economy and its the right thing to do
1482165 i do support a timetable i dont think we can remove our troops immediately i just dont think thats a responsible way to go about it
1482166 i am proud to represent a very well informed congressional district
1482167 as an independent voice in congress i voted against the troop surge in iraq and worked to pass legislation in the last congress and the new one to provide federal funding for stem cell research
1482168 to protect children from new threats posed by imported toys and focused congressional attention on providing relief to chicago area drivers burdened by soaring gas prices the highest in the country
1482169 i think too often he is putting politics ahead of policy
1482170 okay weve got america back what do we do with it now
1482171 its hard to understand why democratic leaders have made some of the concessions they have in the last few weeks
1482172 we should not be waiting around for barack obama to deliver us from conservatives
1482173 moveon members are asking us to consider all options for democratic members of congress who ran on ending the war but vote for more chaos and more troops in iraq including in district advertising and recruitment of primary challengers
1482174 we have to remember that some of us in the congress are you
1482175 one of those people is the speaker of the house theres no one who wants to end this war more than
1482176 i think the democratic party unlike the republican party is very diverse and there is a constant battle among the groups
1482177 they recognize that there are two campaigns the campaign for votes and the campaign for money
1482178 they realize that their ability to influence elections depends on their part in these two campaigns
1482179 what you see is that progressives are driving the national debate
1482180 they are driving the debate in the democratic party and the democratic party is driving the national debate
1482181 as a former state prosecutor i also know what it takes to secure our communities and would push for tougher penalties for criminals and increased funding for our police and first responders so they can do their jobs and keep our families safe
1482182 george w bushs invasion of iraq was illegal and immoral
1482183 we were all very impressed by his excitement and his charisma
1482184 he has some good ideas and is eager to create a change for the area
1482185 i am really very excited about finishing my term as mayor
1482186 but on the other hand there is some intrigue in all this
1482187 enterprise sailed again in september 2005 to conduct a comprehensive oceanographic survey in the gulf of aden and somali basin as well as a collaborative hydrographic survey with the saudi military off the coast of saudi arabia in support of uk government foreign policy
1482188 hms enterprise represents a major improvement to the royal navys surveying and general environmental data gathering ability she is able to collect information on all aspects of the environment from the seabed to the upper atmosphere process and send this information to warfare commanders in real time this information allows the navy to use weapons systems to the best advantage therefore enhancing war fighting ability
1482189 the people who live here deserve to play a bigger role in deciding who the presidential candidates will be
1482190 there is a local feeling that this is a black seat
1482191 it is going to be a huge challenge for this to be decisively about something else than race
1482192 i think it is possible if no one else gets in the contest
1482193 it means campaigns are going to be that much more competitive
1482194 the candidates are going to be prepared for a much longer period of engagement with their opponents
1482195 i think the country is incredibly frustrated with the direction that weve taken in iraq
1482196 mr english has supported that endeavor almost completely right down the line
1482197 it is unprecedented in american history to have congress try to write military tactics into law in the middle of a war
1482198 this type of intensive diplomatic effort similar to the camp david and dayton conferences might promote and accelerate reconciliation and stability in iraq
1482199 has realized after four years what many realized after one and what most realized after two that is was a sectarian conflict for the most part and that we need to get out
1482200 you cant go too far left or too far right they want people who are open minded and seek solutions that solve problems and that are not ideologues ive tried to carry myself in my public policy as such
1482201 there are so many people hurting in northwest pennsylvania because of these unfair trade deals and the job losses and plant closings that have occurred as a result of that
1482202 its just tough to stand idly by and watch it happen when you know you can make a positive difference in peoples lives
1482203 anybody who tries to paint him as a rubber stamp of the republican party doesnt have the record to prove it
1482204 while these two democrats battle it out in a primary english will be busy continuing his work on behalf of the people of pennsylvanias 3rd congressional district
1482205 the excitement over the interview ads is clearly helping drive the governors rise in the polls in both iowa and new hampshire where the ads have run
1482206 has his head stuck in the sand hes voted repeatedly against legislation to combat global warming and help break our nations dependence on foreign oil
1482207 we are going to ship our jobs overseas and buy all of our energy from foreign countries that hate us
1482208 our number one priority right now and the number one environmental problem in the world and in this country is global warming
1482209 the way this congress is moving that issue has started to move very quickly and we decided if the issue was going to move quickly we should gin up our accountability efforts quickly too
1482210 already visible among voters and dont need a long campaign season to get their names out and to win a primary
1482211 theyve got the money on hand they dont have to raise it
1482212 if you intend to be a serious candidate you really cant wait until after the november 2007 elections to get started
1482213 was part of the reason why ive declared as early as i have
1482214 im not sure which way the state is leaning in that regard but i plan to be prepared either way
1482215 they arent in my house they are in my office
1482216 well they arent for me they are for fill in the blank
1482217 children develop tastes largely on the food most available to them says dr jennifer orlet fisher assistant professor of pediatrics at baylor college of medicine in a 1990 study published in the journal developmental psychology familiarity trumped both on 15 occasions a group of 39 preschool age children were given tofu a new food to them laced with sugar or salt or served plain initially wary they soon learned to like whichever they were offered most frequently eventually they came to dislike the other versions simply because the others were different
1482218 the military recruitment of children under the age of 17 however is a clear violation of international law the u n optional protocol no attempt to recruit children 13 16 is allowed in the united states pursuant to treaty
1482219 it is also important to consider the effects of the game within the context of the ongoing wars in iraq and afghanistan undoubtedly soldiers now recruited through americas army will serve in these wars the invasions and occupations of iraq and afghanistan are violations of international law and contributing to their continuation through the propagation of the game is if not a criminal violation a moral outrage
1482220 ubisofts role as publisher of americas army is contributing to an international crime
1482221 but you are not alone secret level was a developer of the 2005 version of the game is child recruitment recruitment to fight the cause of dubious wars the proper business of your company and those of you in their employ
1482222 if ubisofts claims are true why have they not publicly announced the end of the work for the armys recruitment videogame and why have they not ended their contract with the army set to expire in 2015 our requests of mr detoc and ubisoft remain the same we would like to sit down with the company to ask them to end their contracts with the military stop work on the game and make public pronouncements in writing to that effect
1482223 im okay with being in the army but i dont want to go to iraq i dont believe in it
1482224 yes youre going to iraq and youre going to be sent to fort carson trained to go to iraq and then after that youre going to be sent there

1482226 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
1482227 my understanding that the iraiq parliament did not convene on sunday however it has not yet recessed and lawmakers remain ready to reconvene once a new bill is ready for them to consider the iraqi political leaders are continuing to discuss the elections law ambassador crocker and us embassy officials continue to encourage iraqis to work towards compromise and consensus and to develop an elections law that will allow for provincial elections this year
1482228 after the long talks we held it was clear for us that what happened on july 22 was a big conspiracy and very dangerous for the democratic and constitutional process of iraq in particular against the kurds
1482229 a walkout by kurdish lawmakers over how to deal with the disputed oil city of kirkuk
1482230 we cannot have a vote with an absence of a whole faction the vote is useless it will be rejected by the represenatives of this bloc and by the presidency council
1482231 many observers believe talabani would stand with his kurdish compatriots and vote against the measure bringing it back to square one
1482232 the draft of the provinical elections law will be referred to the presidential council which will definitely not approve it so the elections will be postponed until next year
1482233 a vote had been planned for sunday but it was scrapped when lawmakers failed to agree on how the elections would affect kirkuk which minority kurds want to make part of their semi autonomous northern region turkeys nationalist movement party mhp leader devlet bahceli called on the countrys ruling justice and development party akp in a written statement to warn iraqi kurdish groups in kirkuk more openly and take the necessary measures in order to protect turkmens rights turkey who has historical ties with kirkuk has been monitoring the situation very closely and calls on all parties to reach consensus for a solution
1482234 i think we said something about that last week i believe and our position is that we believe that this now is not the time to be making such a decision we believe that the parties need to leave themselves open to all appropriate or all options in order to come to an understanding so that they can proceed with provincial elections this fall
1482235 the iraqi parliament adjourned its tuesday session without reaching an agreement on provisions in the election law regarding the status of the city of kirkuk shahied al jaberi with the shiite united iraqi alliance said lawmakers opted to postpone the issue until the wednesday session because lawmakers could not agree on the kirkuk issue voices of iraq reported
1482236 elections in kirkuk would also be postponed until no later than december 2009
1482237 a turkmen representative said a delay in kirkuk voting was unacceptable
1482238 the parliament session to approve the provincial election law has been delayed until tomorrow
1482239 the deadlock also prevented a vote by parliament on a 21 billion supplemental budget the crisis has marked the first time that elements of one of the most prominent shiite muslim parties the supreme islamic iraqi council have broken with the kurds their traditional allies
1482240 the book alleges that habbush saddams intelligence chief was in cia protective custody after the 2003 invasion that the white house ordered cia officials to have tahir jalil habbush al tikriti write and backdate the letter and paid him 5 million the author quotes two former cia officials who claim to have seen a draft of the letter on white house stationery
1482241 this is the third time u s forces have detained ali al mashhadani without charge
1482242 the military has never substantiated any wrongdoing by him the authorities must make evidence against him public or release him immediately
1482243 under the fixed withdrawal scheme combat troops are to be withdrawn but sufficient forces are to remain to protect the american embassy fight a resumption of al qaeda and contribute to the defence against outside intervention

1482245 two reversals of positions he has taken in the past
1482246 in another switch obama calls for tapping u s oil reserve
1482247 obamas revised position on a key energy issue was his second shift in three days
1482248 obama in shift urges tapping oil from u s reserve
1482249 had met with economic advisers and business leaders in washington last week and they had advised him to call for tapping the government reserve
1482250 team obama cast the proposal as a refinement rather than a flip flop on obamas previous opposition to tapping the 770 million barrel reserve
1482251 energy policy is offering more flip flops than a lake tahoe souvenir stand
1482252 one more week one more barack obama reversal on a key issue actually make that two reversals so much for principles
1482253 kansas is the 22nd state in which naders forces filed papers since his campaign began in february
1482254 how is he barack going to change the culture of washington if he cant stand up to those corporations
1482255 stare long enough into the abyss the abyss will gaze back also
1482256 el fen meno de la homosexualidad es algo que perjudica a las sociedad a la larga pagaremos las consecuencias como las han pagado otras civilizaciones
1482257 cuando se toca la esencia misma de la familia que es la uni n de un var n y una mujer no se puede hablar de familia
1482258 puede haber elementos participados como una casa o una vivienda

1482260 si quieres peras debes arrancar el olmo y plantar un peral
1482261 you could call it a museum ship because it allows people to tour above and below decks so you can see how people lived and worked in the old days
1482262 hes a person like patrick in that hes young and energetic and motivated and patrick took the hill and we think that powers has that same stature and charisma to do so
1482263 jon powers went to war as a soldier he came back on a mission
1482264 mr president you betrayed the american soldiers and the iraqi people once already by failing to plan for the aftermath of saddams regime
1482265 tomorrow on the anniversary of your now infamous mission accomplished speech you have an opportunity to win back at least a little of our faith in your leadership
1482266 with rising income and wealth women should be better represented in the political giving arena
1482267 i think there is a little bit of public education that needs to be done for women
1482268 i dont think women realize that they have the capacity to give that it is an important civic responsibility to give you cant get the change you want in government unless you make sure you elect the right people you cant elect the right people without writing those checks
1482269 if you saw women contribute to their capacity level we would see a very different conversation about issues that are important to women
1482270 george w bush doesnt care what you and i think and neither do his friends in congress
1482271 nowhere has republican obstruction been more blatant and more damaging than in the united states senate where theyve exploited the narrow 51 49 democratic majority to try to block all manner of legislation
1482272 if we want progress on the issues we care about we absolutely must expand the democratic senate majority in 2008
1482273 but its important to remember that he couldnt have done much of his damage without a supine republican congress
1482274 the very same republican senators who have failed us so badly in the past are poised to once again be in the majority if they pick up only one seat in the next election
1482275 i can only talk about what i bring to the table
1482276 dans a good guy he ran a good campaign i think he proved what many of us have been thinking for a long long time which is that mark is beatable
1482277 couldnt beat pryce during the 2006 perfect storm for scandal racked republicans in d c and ohio she is not likely to win the 15th in 2008
1482278 i made it a priority to support our men and women in harms way she hasnt
1482279 certainly the people ive talked to have expressed a grave concern that members of congress would vote to cut off funding for our men and women in harms way
1482280 establishing benchmarks for measuring success in iraq establishing a timeline on which the president has to bring this war to a close is supporting the troops
1482281 not supporting the troops is leaving them in an open ended commitment in which we have no measures of success
1482282 i want to bring to washington the kind of common sense fiscally prudent type of representative that i believe folks in new hampshire want
1482283 im focused on raising resources and expanding a grassroots network both are going well
1482284 we did nothing in terms of fundraising in the first quarter
1482285 we are rebuilding and re growing the basic town committee structure which has fallen apart in recent years
1482286 create opportunities for jeb to be back out amongst republican activists and speak with people one on one
1482287 having been there and served i know that we have to do all that we can to make sure that our troops when we send them off to battle have the appropriate equipment training and expertise they need to come home soon and safely
1482288 when they do come home and if they have been injured that were not sending them to rat infested hospitals where they have to pay for their own meals i think we can demand more for our veterans who have given up so much for us
1482289 protect all of our workers jobs and make certain that the decisions we make in washington arent going to ship the manufacturing jobs overseas
1482290 they want to talk about residency i want to talk about results
1482291 so that a candidate and an organization can be in place in the event that regula doesnt run
1482292 my approach in 14 years at the ohio statehouse has been one where ive been a person who is accessible to people in my district
1482293 im responsive to whats going on in the district and i would do the same in congress im a person who believes that we need fresh ideas to solve complicated problems
1482294 thats the same type of approach that i would take in the u s congress if elected
1482295 the primary will draw presidential candidates to washington giving our state a chance to play an important role nationally
1482296 will continue to be a place where presidential candidates must win support through grassroots organizing rather than through expensive television ads
1482297 because americans refused to be silent amnesty was defeated last night and our nation won a great victory against those who would sell us out
1482298 we have to stop all legal immigration except for people coming into this country as immediate family members and or refugees
1482299 give us time to assimilate the people who have come here
1482300 were talking about something that goes to the very heart of this nation whether or not we will actually survive as a nation the ramifications are much much more significant than any that weve been discussing so far
1482301 the job of president of the united states is to always do what is best for this country
1482302 by him fighting this hes saying im with the majority of the american people who do not want amnesty and i will fight for you
1482303 calling this amnesty doesnt damn it in the eyes of most people
1482304 amnesty is not as negative a notion as some people here in washington think
1482305 there is no doubt that we are 100 miles an hour to have daniel wells at the footy club for the next three or four years play his whole career out with us
1482306 it takes time theres no rush well just keep working our way through
1482307 theres a fair few blokes there that we want to really lock away but you cant do them all in the one week
1482308 mr mcguire in particular was embarrassed and furious about being lied to by didak and heath shaw
1482309 dr paul broun needs your immediate financial help to overcome the political big bucks of the jim whitehead campaign
1482310 if you do not help then the average people lose and the political elite will buy the special election
1482311 i dont want to say its much ado about nothing but we think its overblown a bit
1482312 but losing a player of james magnitude would be nothing short of a nightmare for the nba
1482313 for the most part the league considers the players to be fungible products
1482314 but lebron is one of the three or four players the league would definitely hate to lose if a team lost him or kobe bryant to europe it would lose its mind it would be devastating
1482315 it would be disappointing to lose one of our star players but i have no concern at all about the best players playing anywhere but in the nba for a long time to come
1482316 id be surprised if one of our top players chose to go to europe but if it did happen there are many players who would step up and fill the void
1482317 first of all we dont know that theres going to be a 50 million offer
1482318 and secondly he wouldnt be able to accomplish over there the things that he wants to do over here which are to win nba championships mvp awards etc
1482319 i better not bite that or i might get caught
1482320 as a symbol of the things we are fighting to preserve free thought and free expression of a free people
1482321 last year we were the number one donator out of abates regions for this event at 25 000
1482322 youd think that harley riders arent that caring of people
1482323 as a symbol of the things we are fighting to preserve free thought and free expression of a free people
1482324 as a symbol of the things we are fighting to preserve free thought and free expression of a free people
1482325 but i recognize that sound its the sound of freedom
1482326 ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day any day
1482327 it will be a good sign on election day if there are a lot of bikes parked outside the polling places of america
1482328 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants to inflate your tires
1482329 tonight all over america there are families sitting down to have dinner and i doubt that any of them said i wonder what the next president will think about evolution
1482330 do unto others as you would have them do unto you
1482331 it doesnt bother me so much if a person says hes an atheist it bothers me when a person says hes a christian but refuses to live like one
1482332 there are a lot of americans who deeply do believe that human life is important and believe that families are the crux of our society
1482333 there was a time in this world when america was everybodys hero now were the bully
1482334 the more powerful we are the less we have to act like it
1482335 congress extensively deals with financing and accounting issues and i see my experience as far superior to rep porters in that regard
1482336 he has been basically low key which you would expect in the minority waiting to see which way the winds blows
1482337 when i go to the house floor i try to go to someone who i havent met before
1482338 reasonable minds will find solutions i dont think its whos in charge
1482339 the main reason im running for the united states senate is that congress needs to be doing some things that its just not getting done
1482340 i think that i would be a better senator than either of those
1482341 we are no longer dependent on oil gas and coal as a bank owner tax lawyer ive done the numbers we are only choosing to be
1482342 it takes a smart tax lawyer to understand these things i guess
1482343 nobody else seems to be talking about them democrats and republicans alike
1482344 dont run for congress in the 3rd district in minnesota as a democrat
1482345 democrats who really want to get rid of want to make sure that they get somebody who can win
1482346 and somebody who is a bank owner a tax lawyer these are the kinds of things that maybe are in essence irrelevant to what kind of a job one can do as a senator but on the other hand understanding the tax law understanding how business works understanding how banking works can be an asset
1482347 i have no problem with more and more democrats getting into the democratic primary in that state and campaigning and spending their money against each other
1482348 were certainly watching with interest on the democratic side but were very happy with where senator coleman is
1482349 dont have anything to be excited about given that they are trying to defend a senator with low popularity ratings and an ideological record completely out of touch with his state
1482350 nebraskans want a leader who will stand with our troops and military commanders
1482351 most people acknowledge that the american economy is dependent on immigrants
1482352 we dont want people who are intent on destroying our society if they are here illegally
1482353 we need to recognize as a nation that congress does not have the ability to deal with immigration on a case by case basis
1482354 the congressman has failed us for not instituting conservative principles
1482355 a parrot of george bush who does not have a mind of his own on partisan issues
1482356 there are some things i am left of chris and some i am to the right of him
1482357 we will deliver a sound process for this critical selection but want to focus tonight and in the coming days on what matters most sen thomas his legacy and his family
1482358 positioned himself as someone whos going to energize the base of the party that hasnt settled on anyone yet and at the same time unite other various wings of the party
1482359 hes really mobilized and activated the base of our party thats why theres so much excitement about him beginning this process of running for president
1482360 the fact that thompson without lifting a finger was doing robustly in the polls and even up in the top three for a while was a real sign that there is a vacuum there
1482361 brings what we think is a fairly solid conservative in the race but also someone i think who can appeal to moderates
1482362 as he appeals to those moderates does he alienate some of those conservatives who are looking to be energized by him thats whats going to be the big trick
1482363 dont have the same misgivings about thompson because he hasnt put a thumb in their eyes over time like mccain has
1482364 the voters look for strength and trust in a nominee and a presidential candidate
1482365 hes not going to get off the plane with some friendly local reporter saying senator what would you like to talk about today
1482366 its going to be senator whats your position on the surge in iraq and do you think there should be a timetable for the iraqi government achieving results
1482367 i have a long record of standing up for the priorities of the people i serve and seeking innovative solutions to the challenges we face
1482368 i will be an independent voice in congress that will truly represent west virginian values and create opportunities for our families and for our children
1482369 thats part of a campaign and those things will come out as time goes on
1482370 for me right now my focus is on truly talking with people and engaging in dialogue
1482371 professional politicians in washington have made a career out of trying to defeat congresswoman capito by deliberately misleading her constituents
1482372 they fail every time because west virginians understand the congresswoman is an independent voice that is committed to working on their behalf
1482373 voters in next years elections will be offered two distinct visions for the future of our country strength or weakness resolve or indecision security or vulnerability
1482374 america is at a crossroads and i intend to be a voice in congress that stands up for preserving our nations strength safety and future
1482375 jag tror faktiskt inte att ea r ute efter att utnyttja andras licenser med d liga spel
1482376 vi har varit d r f rr de flesta av v ra konkurrenter r d r och har varit d r det r inte vad vi g r l ngre det r inte marknaden vi r ute efter
1482377 jag tror ni observerat att ea under de senaste ren inte haft m nga egna utm rkta originella varum rken
1482378 during the second quarter of 2008 pacer continued to show improvement in its overall financial performance
1482379 this was accomplished during a period of difficult economic conditions including inclement weather and floods in the midwest which resulted in a railroad embargo of midwest traffic for about one week we are particularly pleased with our intermodal segment where we were able to overcome the difficult conditions and improve performance
1482380 based on a series of rolling launches worldwide we expect to see additional growth opportunities for nexavar particularly for the treatment of liver cancer
1482381 i remember one of the family a young man he wanted advice regarding a letter from the court
1482382 dont cry gods arms will be around you all the night long
1482383 i cant watch it right now but even the stillscreen there makes her look kick ass
1482384 one word boo as i was watching the trailer i silently mourned xena warrior princess i loved that she was more athletic looking angrier and had a deeper voice this wonder woman sounds like she dropped out of nyu for a minute to kick some ass and look good doing it
1482385 when professional politicians broke the law stole your money and laughed while they were doing it i pursued them like a hound dog grabbed on to their pants leg and didnt let go til i shook out the truth
1482386 this may be our last chance to elect an outsider who will stay an outsider a senator who will tell the truth and fight like hell to make a difference
1482387 the conviction of former dekalb county sheriff sidney dorsey the resignation of fulton county sheriff jackie barrett the return of public funds by sen zell miller and the termination of georgia governor sonny perdues abuse of government airplanes and helicopters for private benefit
1482388 people have stayed even though hes gone over his time at every one so far
1482389 he has taken in their enthusiasm and their heartfelt sentiment but there hasnt been a change in terms of his intentions or his focus
1482390 while i think he appreciates the good intentions of that question he is also trying to bring us back to issues that are near and dear to his heart because of their importance to all of us
1482391 far sighted and prescient and visionary on so many things including the internet
1482392 we call him the goracle sometimes because he just seems to have a sense of whats going to be important down the line
1482393 this administration has refused to face reality of the botch that they have made out of the war
1482394 has voted consistently to show that he isnt supportive of the war
1482395 the national environment needs to improve a little bit until people will feel fully comfortable
1482396 as a general matter i think fred thompsons career in the senate demonstrates a guy who does have a pretty strong commitment to limited government free enterprise and particularly federalist principles
1482397 much more good in this than ill and i think it will help this institution and ultimately this country
1482398 steve is the one candidate on the democratic side who has held elected office
1482399 most importantly to me steve is electable hes proven he can win and hold elected office
1482400 talked to folks here in washington as well as in north carolina
1482401 in our district people like moderates they reject the conservatives and they reject the liberals they like people who have basic moderate upstate new york values
1482402 there will be a lot of changes over the next 12 months
1482403 if ray meier had run in any other time frame he would have been the congressman it was the iraq war and it was a message that was sent
1482404 you are going to see some changes in the district though even in registration democrats never gave people a reason to be a democrat michael has
1482405 authoritarianism is a viable regime form even under conditions of advanced modernization and integration with the global economy
1482406 likely as the result of a sudden crisis brought on by years of corruption mismanagement and institutional decay
1482407 the china fantasy how our leaders explained away chinese repression
1482408 american policy toward china since 1989 has been sold to the american people on the basis of a fraud that is on the false premise that trade and engagement with china would change chinas political system
1482409 a ruthless willingness to innovate a strong belief in sovereignty and multilateralism and a desire to accumulate the tools of asymmetric power projection
1482410 with its resolute hostility to democracy will serve as a model for dictators juntas and other undemocratic governments throughout the world and in all likelihood it will be a leading supporter of these regimes
1482411 our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1482412 during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding
1482413 i feel that at this particular moment in my life i cant devote the full attention and focused energy that a successful congressional campaign would require
1482414 i think we have an excellent chance of staying roughly where we are
1482415 since taking office in january i have been focused on representing the people of southern arizona to the best of my ability providing quick responsive constituent services is my primary goal
1482416 we believe its early for her to be voting with 96 percent of the time
1482417 gabby giffords is going to be a tough candidate shes got a lot of money already in the bank shell have even more by the end of the year and the republicans are going to have to get unified if we expect to win
1482418 the district is a conservative to moderate district and obviously coming from a liberal to moderate perspective is not representative of the district
1482419 is following the democrat party line almost verbatim when the district here has a republican majority and independent voters
1482420 in my opinion shes doing everything right and i expect that well hold that seat
1482421 their shoddy work uses only portions of my quotes to try to convince you that i waffle on the issue
1482422 iraq has not been a big thing in our district
1482423 i think that our opponents are seeing that momentum theyre seeing that we have a commanding lead and theyve decided to take some cheap shots
1482424 that comes with the territory of being the guy thats going to win
1482425 i dont think he wants to take anything for granted
1482426 but i think the best chance the democrats had has elapsed
1482427 he is someone that is on our radar screen simply because people in indiana are ready for change
1482428 the political environment is only going to get worse for
1482429 the fact is while i do not believe that the surge will succeed none of us actually knows that it will not work
1482430 at this point it seems to me that our position as a congress should be to encourage success in this mission
1482431 we all pray for sen johnsons full recovery its a difficult situation but we are forging ahead and intend to have a formidable candidate for that race whether sen johnson decides to run again or whether he sits it out and retires
1482432 i believe strongly that the system requires that we have credible candidates on both sides and that the incumbent have credible challengers that present options to the electorate
1482433 at this stage im adding up the strong yeses and the yeah somebodys got to do it and thats not a ringing endorsement so we need to balance those things and kind of check the final score
1482434 all i know about sen johnsons condition is what i read in the newspaper i have to take that at face value i assume hes getting better
1482435 people are going to want to know what are we going to do to protect this country what are we going to do to protect the border and how then are we going to move the country forward rather than getting mired in battles of semantics and politics over how we got where we are
1482436 during the course of all this i started studying whats going on in politics and why are things not getting done
1482437 i realized you cant have a resolution to the laundry list of the business of the nation when the context the background context of the political conversation is as dysfunctional as it is
1482438 our warriors are phenomenal but because were not willing to take the civilian collateral damage because of the political correctness and the outcry that would happen its a no win situation
1482439 who are breathing a sigh of relief that they feel now like theres somebody whos not so vehemently right wing
1482440 he has had a grievous grievous health condition and anyone who does some basic reading on the type of injury that he has sustained youll find that recovery if ever is very very long
1482441 the most threatening year yet to the fairness of americas state courts
1482442 attacks that got pretty nasty and sometimes misleading or false
1482443 that is what senate races and gubernatorial races and congressional races do
1482444 you have to prepare early and that is what is happening with our judiciary
1482445 candidates did not make promises that would jeopardize their careers on the bench
1482446 ford was a great candidate and ran a solid campaign
1482447 got off to a rough start and he still won
1482448 we feel were in good shape but we know well enough not to take anything for granted
1482449 while the senator is a loyal republican hes always been independent minded
1482450 pick up the phone s always been there for them voting with president bush 93 percent of the time last year and even more often before that
1482451 while there are a number of qualified popular democrats in tennessee only a couple of them are known statewide and that poses a problem for them
1482452 gov bredesen is the candidate with the most statewide recognition and support
1482453 part of the reason corkers campaign cost nearly 20 million was that he was struggling to introduce himself to people outside of chattanooga
1482454 its amazing that this little hobby i started 10 years ago has benefited so many musicians disc makers was my first choice to take the company to new heights their operational expertise is just what little cd baby needed to grow up
1482455 they couldnt go from box cutters one week to weapons grade anthrax the next

1482460 two million dollars is the bar for entry for a serious candidate
1482461 theres a point of diminishing returns however at around the 4 to 5 million dollar mark there are only so many media markets in the state and you can only advertise so much before you risk turning people off
1482462 where the war is concerned i hate to say it but voters can have short memories
1482463 while the dscc cant discuss its recruiting efforts i can say that the democratic party is going to field a nominee with a completely different voting record than sen smith
1482464 hes a democrat coming from a republican leaning district the democrats need someone who can win downstate in clackamas county and pull at least some votes in eastern oregon
1482465 its hard to imagine westlund getting reelected to the state senate
1482466 it makes a lot of sense for him to be looking down the road
1482467 we are raising the profile of these type of issues
1482468 we have to play our part in delivering a positive message about football
1482469 football engages motivates and inspires but we know it can spill over and get ugly
1482470 we all have responsibility to deal with these excesses and i sense now there is a dedication from all quarters including the media to do that
1482471 we want prevention rather than sanction and weve given credit to the media for playing a major part in the reduction of simulation
1482472 now we want to see this programme becoming much more than just a campaign and results in making unacceptable behaviour just that unacceptable
1482473 agre does not have much to put on the table beyond a nobel prize for chemistry and global work on behalf of academic freedom in todays politics that gives him about the same odds as albert schweitzer
1482474 i get back there all the time my mothers there my brothers and sisters live there my ancestors for four generations are buried in minnesota soil im from a large farming family
1482475 i grew up with walter mondale as my hero and now hes a friend and a hero
1482476 the issues that lie ahead are going to require more a sophisticated science background than is presently represented
1482477 i dont in any way whatsoever see this as loss of human life
1482478 i think this is an issue created by certain fundamentalist christians and does not represent the feelings of the great majority of people in minnesota or the country and i disagree
1482479 our national government is almost gridlocked at times with the partisan bickering and the problems are in many cases not solved as a democrat i feel like the party has insight which needs to be heard and things are starting to change and i hope to contribute to that
1482480 kentucky is healthier and stronger now than it was four years ago
1482481 will go on and make a good nominee and a good leader and will go into the fall election with broad support across this state
1482482 we have sent a clear message tonight and that message is it is time for some bold experienced effective and honest leadership in frankfort for a change
1482483 as i watched what the democrat vision is for this country it simply isnt in line with the vision ive held dear to my heart for so many years
1482484 this year i received a very heavy persuasive volley from the nrcc
1482485 certainly being the commander of robins air force base in the district which is not only a key part of our nations defenses but the driver of the economy in middle georgia certainly would make him extremely qualified to represent that area
1482486 im running against the vision and the ideas that he put into place when he voted for the democratic leadership
1482487 he has not given the people of middle georgia the voice that they should have and deserve
1482488 anybody who represents a competitive seat would be wise to run a very good campaign raise plenty of money and do the things you need to do whether or not a credible opponent emerges
1482489 i am running for president because these times call for a leader with a proven track record and a demonstrated ability to bring people together to tackle our problems at home and abroad
1482490 i am that person not because i say so but because of what i have done and what i can do for the american people
1482491 we all know how well that worked out for the guy who currently has the job
1482492 i would not have run if i had thought that ernie fletcher was doing a good job and could be re elected i got into it to give us a choice of another standard bearer and a chance to win
1482493 he has gained momentum certainly over the past couple of months
1482494 name recognition has really helped fletcher on top of that he has been aggressive this spring tying in campaigning with official ceremonial duties
1482495 the gaming issue has been the big point of distinction on the democratic side
1482496 floridas diverse population will be more influential in the presidential primary process
1482497 rudy giuliani is the candidate who will win in florida
1482498 we have a strong and growing team on the ground and the mayors optimistic vision for the country is resonating across the state
1482499 by threatening to punish florida democrats because of actions taken by florida republicans it is the party as a whole which will bear the brunt of your retaliation
1482500 the rules are inflexible and it doesnt matter who is running the rnc
1482501 those rules will be enforced because they are part of the rules that were crafted at the last convention and they cant be changed
1482502 together we have not only helped bring about real change in florida we have also helped this case become central to the national debate over election reform
1482503 at this unique moment in history there is too much work to be done in the house of representatives to take on a campaign for the u s senate
1482504 wont be about democratic leadership it will be about congressman mitchell and the job hes done for arizona
1482505 because he has serious concerns about its impact on the estate tax and on capital gains taxes
1482506 he didnt vote for the current budget but he refuses to put any budget proposals together that he would support so basically this seems to be more of a retirement package for harry mitchell
1482507 tells us that its a good prospect for me or a candidate like me so were going to continue to do the due diligence process and see what it looks like in the next few months
1482508 im looking at it as seriously as one can yet i am still far from a final decision as to whether or not im going to run
1482509 when you look at the significant bills that have been placed in front of him generally he votes the opposite of what i would have voted if i were there
1482510 he seems to be as strong as hes been and hes continuing to move forward and run a strong campaign
1482511 at all levels throughout the process the talk was about how pete domenicis disgraced new mexico and how its time for a change
1482512 so there are steps that were taking to shore up our organization for that specific election
1482513 theres a big divide right now between the national democratic party and the state democratic party
1482514 i think in washington people are really excited about the possibility of taking out domenici and in new mexico democrats dont really think thats going to happen
1482515 no democrat has a chance if he decides to run for re election
1482516 domenici has not only the advantages of long term incumbency and the money the name recognition and so on but hes hugely popular
1482517 its the intention of the republican party of new mexico to ensure that we elect as many republican officials as possible throughout the state
1482518 i want to help rebuild trust and put congress on a new path
1482519 in contrast to the last election my opponent will have to clarify his views and his voting record
1482520 really is for higher taxes more restraint on economic growth and a weak kneed response to national security spending
1482521 when you enter a contest for public office you should welcome challenge
1482522 and were back but im sorry to tell you that former house speaker newt gingrich has hung up on us
1482523 i am most disappointed in fact i am angry because we were told that we would talk about his book we would talk about issues before the public right now
1482524 i was really glad that hes begun to participate in the political dialogue
1482525 we never agreed to a shorter interview they told us they had to do a shorter interview because he was tired and we said we cant agree to that
1482526 it was clearly a misunderstanding she gave a terrific interview it was very well done it was the best interview we did all day but we were very clear with them that the speaker had a prior commitment and that we could only give the show 40 minutes
1482527 he is no closer to making a decision today than he was yesterday or will be four months from now
1482528 the american people want to understand our plans for ending this war
1482529 when we see an opportunity to put another pro choice democratic woman in congress we take it
1482530 represents the best chance to put a woman in congress
1482531 the right candidate with the right message at the right time
1482532 field is critically important and the support that we have is very heavily field oriented
1482533 meet with nebraskans and hear their thoughts and concerns about the future of our state and our country
1482534 this listening tour will help me make this decision and have a wealth of useful thorough information should i decide to run
1482535 the breadth and depth of the information contained in these datasets presents an unprecedented opportunity to document describe analyze and diagnose the state of health care in kansas
1482536 include value added tools such as disease episode grouper or built in calculations for quality measures
1482537 starting this morning more and more users started seeing prompts on their home pages inviting them to switch over and try out the new facebook were also really happy to say that anyone can try out the new site now by visiting
1482538 the crew wasnt filming at the time the reporter was detained we regret that the reporter was beaten even though he acted according to procedures
1482539 credo a chi non si pentito anche dietro le sbarre credo alle favole alle principesse alle persone che rimangono se stesse
1482540 non con loro ma con il sangue si riscatta lonore di roma
1482541 roma un ideale e gli ideali non si possono distruggere
1482542 everyone including your grandma is using google earth so now you can finally explain what you do to family and friends and theyll actually understand what you mean
1482543 consumer maps like google earth google maps and virutal earth have defined a new user experience and gis applications will have to support this
1482544 not only is charlie vulnerable that vulnerability reflects our discontent in the 15th congressional district with the quality of representation that hes giving us in washington
1482545 in this district though he positions himself as a moderate he is not a moderate
1482546 hes a fiscal conservative who takes a moderate stand on social positions which is probably exactly where most of the voters in the district are
1482547 so far she hasnt even shown that she can get out of a democrat primary for mayor of allentown let alone a congressional primary
1482548 mr walberg runs on values but he is not worried about his values he is worried about yours and mine and there is nothing wrong with my values
1482549 is going to have much more name id than he did
1482550 anything is possible in politics but i think it is going to be more difficult
1482551 we are hearing a lot from the people and maybe some of those that didnt vote for me
1482552 i am getting my energy from being back in the district
1482553 im pissed off at that s o b on the second floor that thinks he is going to run this state like a dictator
1482554 my message to the governor is stick it up your a
1482555 i think gov schweitzer will be vulnerable because montanans view its more about him than about serving montanans
1482556 no definitive plans on getting involved in the races in 08
1482557 it just seemed like the voice of our politicians was being heard loud and clear but the voice of our average montanans wasnt being heard
1482558 thats like bill gates writing a 100 check to a homeless shelter and feeling good about it
1482559 fear revenge attacks they say stones were thrown at them as they worked near a right wing neighborhood
1482560 in both attacks using construction vehicles the motives of the attacker remain a mystery local press reports suggested that the attackers had previous involvement with crime and drugs and no links to militant groups have emerged
1482561 the public wants their leaders to work across party lines to find solutions to real problems
1482562 have repeatedly re elected him because of his hard work and that isnt going to change
1482563 we believe his record is going to speak for itself in 2008 just as it has in the previous election cycles
1482564 represents the values of the 26 counties of the 6th district
1482565 represents the values of the 26 blocks of downtown kansas city
1482566 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own
1482567 the challenges are greater and exceed irans ability to reply
1482568 the technology was designed around the behavior of a conventional engine using an existing engine sound which makes it instantly recognisable with the pitch and frequency helping to identify vehicle distance and speed
1482569 each time the driver steps on the accelerator a counter push back control mechanism is activated if the system detects excess pressure helping to inform the driver that they could be using more fuel than required
1482570 it was well known that mr tenenbaum was jewish lived his religious beliefs and by his actions appeared to have a close affinity for israel
1482571 we believe that mr tenenbaum was subjected to unusual and unwelcome scrutiny because of his faith and ethnic background a practice that would undoubtedly fit a definition of discrimination
1482572 dont just get pissed take a load of drugs and miss the bands do all three
1482573 the comments made by bands within the festival booklet do not reflect in any way the festival stance on drug usage the festival operates a zero tolerance approach in relation to drugs
1482574 i will bring this to the attention of the officers investigating what happened to this young woman encouraging the taking of drugs is clearly inappropriate i am sure the organisers will be mortified
1482575 many chinese have been expecting a post olympics economic slowdown but it has already started and the games have not even begun
1482576 we must maintain steady relatively fast development and control excessive price rises as the priority tasks of macro adjustment
1482577 throughout its history the ea sports maui invitational has become synonymous with the kickoff of the college basketball season
1482578 we look forward to commemorating the tournaments 25 maui glory fans from across the nation can look forward to a memorable experience on and off the court
1482579 whether you like it or not you will be judged by your appearance and behavior in a matter of seconds
1482580 the project its design its density were all well received
1482581 our main area of interest is the traffic impact it will have in the neighborhood
1482582 it will combine the best of the historical neighborhood like east sacramento with a green future
1482583 motivate me to continue the profitability for a period of three to five years
1482584 i thought it would be a great benefit to me and my staff if we had the opportunity to work with a larger firm that had more resources
1482585 the house republican steering committee heard the base and they ignored the base if they refuse to hear that change is needed we will wipe them out and replace them with new blood that recognizes that a corrupt party rejected by the voters will not be embraced again by those voters until the corruption is purged
1482586 if we must take on the vulnerable members of the house steering committee and contribute even to their electoral defeat so be it
1482587 this party of ours must be pruned and it must be pruned by those of us who care about it before meeting the butchers shears in the hands of the voters again in 2008
1482588 the assertion that i have an ethical problem is completely false
1482589 a sensational story that falsely created an appearance of impropriety
1482590 we had a candid frank discussion and i answered all of the questions i was asked and was approved by both the steering committee and the republican conference
1482591 i think that i am a fresh and energetic new face
1482592 i think i can bring everything thats needed to the table i am very different from both of the other candidates and i think that is exactly what we need
1482593 im the right voice in washington for our very diverse 15th congressional district in that respect
1482594 if you were to maintain an african american presence in that seat certainly mcdonalds decision to run would complicate things in that it would split some african american votes
1482595 in a city like philadelphia a member of city council is far more important to your daily life than your state rep or your member of congress
1482596 you deal with city councilmen for everything from police to trash to schools their work is just very different
1482597 i dont think its as much about who they were before than about the campaigns that theyve run
1482598 tell heather wilson after four years its time to end the war
1482599 this is about votes in iraq this is not about votes in 2008
1482600 we believe that the seats very winnable she is extremely vulnerable and there is a lot of interest amongst democrats in the district to run against her
1482601 the truths already out there about her involvement in all of this and we really dont think its going to make her any more vulnerable
1482602 she has won the toughest of races last year in a horrible environment we know shell be successful
1482603 this issue clearly goes to heather wilsons lack of ethical standards her hypocrisy and her disingenuousness
1482604 this time around kuhl will have to show independence from president bush
1482605 the iraq war and making the bush tax cuts permanent are two things randy kuhl supports
1482606 he has veered far right instead of moderating he has super glued himself
1482607 people are tired of playing party lines and they just want people that give answers
1482608 randy kuhl will not have one but two terms to improve the district and that license has expired
1482609 everything from the representation the state of wyoming has to i think the state of politics at the national level today
1482610 what ive heard is that somebody will be running against her because the partys really concerned about losing the seat
1482611 it is her decision to make and as far as we know she is running
1482612 if the democrats had a presidential candidate who was not anathema to the state i think the democrat running against her could easily
1482613 last thursday sens clinton and byrd introduced a proposal to deauthorize the war im pleased to have their support but i encourage them to go further
1482614 we must deauthorize the war and set a timetable to get our troops out by the end of this year
1482615 research shows that getting a young person to register and vote at age 18 is the strongest predictor of lifelong voting behavior
1482616 also offers users an interactive experience where they can learn everything they need to know about voting to watching entertaining psas public service announcements they can share with their friends
1482617 the more you engage the more of a difference you can make the first step is to make your voice heard
1482618 he has never been contacted by the justice department in any way
1482619 he has no idea what the investigation is really about
1482620 the most stringent ethical guidelines in all of his public service in the house
1482621 the 41st district has become a place where apathy reigns and suspicions reign instead of a place that knows its representative
1482622 the news of mr lewis ethical quandaries has caused democrats to become quite serious about the seat
1482623 issues of practicality and timing weigh heavily in favor of deferring to the house investigation
1482624 looking to hide from the embarrassment of yet another court ruling against her
1482625 if the iraqis do not step up to this challenge in the coming months then it will be time to re evaluate
1482626 he is really driving himself to the middle as much as he can
1482627 he knows that the group in the middle is going to tell the story in the election
1482628 the trend lines are good for democrats and people now realize that
1482629 i believe the country has spoken with respect to its desire for change
1482630 in the event that i do decide to run thats what my message will be about
1482631 walz is considered extremely vulnerable and thats why youve seen pelosi and the national democrats take such an interest in him
1482632 it is a district that is conservative leaning and i think walz is people are going to find out hes a lot more liberal than they expected
1482633 following the line with the most radical and most liberal elements of the dfl
1482634 his voice and expertise we are confident will be returned in november 2008
1482635 is focused on still learning his new job and on accomplishing some of the things he promised he would work on during the campaign
1482636 over the course of my 19 years in elected office i have represented virtually all of this district whether its on the school board city council assembly or senate
1482637 historically in terms of elections voters vote on background experience what peoples plans are for the future their platform their agenda
1482638 if you look at all levels of government you see broad diversity
1482639 serving in congress for the past 15 years has been one of the greatest honors of my life
1482640 i would like to thank the people of the 5th district for this wonderful opportunity and for their confidence in me
1482641 with an earlier presidential primary florida will now take its rightful place near the front of the line in determining the next leader of the free world
1482642 this is not the first time that a state legislature has set its primary on a date outside dnc party rules
1482643 as with similar situations in the past the dnc is working closely with the state party to look at the alternatives for proceeding in accordance with the rules on or after february 5th
1482644 maine people tell me that they want our involvement in the iraq war the worst foreign policy mistake in our nations history to end
1482645 on the big issues the record is there for all to see
1482646 how we have voted and what we have fought for reflect profoundly different views visions and beliefs
1482647 mainers will draw on distinctions between collins and allen on everything from their accomplishments to their small business records
1482648 collins has demonstrated her effectiveness by working across party lines for the benefit of maine and the nation
1482649 collins is one of the most hardworking on the hill she has passed lots of legislation for maine while allen has passed or sponsored very little in his tenure and he hasnt paid attention to the other half of the state
1482650 it would be interesting to see if there is a real difference between allen and other democrats
1482651 will work to promote her established reputation as an independent
1482652 conversations went from casual to strong motivation and strong encouragement to pursue this because of the realization of the lack of leadership that existed in this district and the need to provide job opportunities and job creation
1482653 in times past people were so focused on voting a straight party line
1482654 we believe we are very well positioned heading into 08 were playing offense in a region where many have counted us out and contrary to popular belief we are going to compete there
1482655 i dont anticipate that we have any problem holding on to those two and in fact were going to have five seats that are democratic
1482656 all of my adult life ive been involved in service to my country leadership trying to make things better and so i see this as an extension of what ive spent my adult life doing
1482657 there are few people who have as much credibility as i have on that issue
1482658 i think people have a realization after the last scare with the sub base at least i hope they do of how important defense is to our district and its important to get somebody elected who understands its important and gets in the right position to be of assistance
1482659 congressman murphy is focused on representing the people of the 5th district and doing the job they sent him to do here in washington
1482660 were really disgusted with some of the things that were going on with some republicans in congress and it resonated throughout the country but ironically the democrats came in saying they were going to change things but nothings really changed
1482661 the republican party here in connecticut understood that our values and our message is good and that we cannot let the more liberal elements of the democratic party as personified by chris murphy and take this country down a path of economic ruin and military weakness
1482662 i talk about the war reluctantly theres really nothing good to be said about the war it has cost us excruciatingly in terms of lives horribly in terms of dollars but the war thanks to president bush and thanks to chris shays remains the elephant in the room
1482663 chris is focusing on his job that hes elected to do representing the people of the 4th and election day is a long way away
1482664 hes doing everything right as he usually does and is in good position to seek re election
1482665 if the presidents new strategy does not demonstrate significant results by august then congress should consider all options including a redefinition of our mission and a gradual but significant withdrawal of our troops next year
1482666 i continue to believe that it is a mistake to send more u s troops to baghdad which is engulfed by sectarian strife
1482667 i have repeatedly expressed directly to the president my opposition to his plan to increase the overall number of american troops in iraq despite my opposition however the surge of troops is under way at this time
1482668 it is important that the senate hear gen petraeus assessment of the impact of the presidents strategy and that committee members have the opportunity to question the general thoroughly so that we can determine whether the strategy and mission in iraq should be continued altered or redefined
1482669 she has said publicly that she doesnt support an open ended commitment in iraq
1482670 she has very carefully studied these things and its not pure political strategy
1482671 collins has been a very popular politician for a very long time
1482672 collins has been consistently supporting it there couldnt be a more clear contrast between them
1482673 chronicles the influence of the classic role playing fantasy game on the franchise other special features include outtakes cast commentary an anti piracy message from bender an interactive

1482743 to all of our fans we are sad to bring you the news that our upcoming shows in the uk are going to be our last as a band we thank you for all your love and support these past few years its been a blast but the time has come for the 4 of us to go our separate ways
1482744 a former band director at haskell high school has pleaded guilty to forcible sodomy involving a former juvenile student
1482745 she wanted it really to be kept a secret for a long time you know and i think women should because they should be able to announce what theyre having and when its time to make the announcement
1482746 pueda ver in situ como funcionan la sesiones de la corte
1482747 its because they know that consumers are finally getting tired of it and wont put up with their greed anymore so they are being forced to cut back a little
1482748 the one member of the band that takes orders from me
1482749 what does it say about you that you might be more well known as a rush fan than an economist
1482750 the price has gone up and i have to raise my price accordingly
1482751 there must be something we can do about the price of eggs
1482752 i dont have the room for the eggs even if they were free
1482753 i dont have room for more eggs the customers are only buying 2 or 3 eggs at a time now if you were to drop the price of eggs back down to the original price the customers would start buying by the dozen again
1482754 when the price of eggs gets down to where it was before we will start buying by the dozen
1482755 it was quite serious the doctor said i was absolutely forbidden from doing anything im on the second round of antibiotics now so im recovering it was deeply painful to cancel the shows because id never really cancelled anything before it was heartbreaking i feel sorry for the people who wanted to see us play

1482760 a rescue happens very quickly and thats why its really rare to catch it on film
1482761 you spot it and you think youre moving swimmers and the next thing you know theyre in trouble and if the lifeguard is not really alert and on top of it they can miss the whole thing
1482762 we were just swimming right here next to this walk and the water kind of swelled up and just kept pulling us in
1482763 hes not too good of a swimmer but im all right theyre all right thanks to these lifeguards right here
1482764 usually with a tropical storm or a hurricane you get a lot of inexperienced surfers down here or people who want to walk out here on the rocks
1482765 if the lifeguard wasnt there if he hadnt been alert it could easily have been a drowning in this situation
1482766 we want these guidelines to be a motivation for the expansion of treatment
1482767 when they told me i was speechless this new organization has done some wonderful things for this team and to induct me into this ring of honor is unbelievable
1482768 who would have thought it a guy coming here as a rookie free agent not knowing too much about the vikings and their history i find myself in 2008 and in the ring of honor im just shocked
1482769 they told me today my wife didnt even tell me she said were going down to watch practice i played a little golf this morning and i came over here and i was shocked
1482770 it was low when i first got here i just wasnt sure coming from a small division ii school to a nfl organization the caliber of the minnesota vikings i didnt think i was capable of making this team as i stayed around every week my confidence started improving it showed me that maybe i do have a chance of making it once i went through the preseason games and found out i was still on the roster i knew i had a home i knew this is where i belong
1482771 never i just went out and when i played the game i tried to give it my all all my emotions tried my hardest just left it on the field every time i played much interaction with the new owners yes i have i think theyre doing such an excellent job for the vikings organization i think thats a big part of a franchise if you want to head in the right direction it starts with the ownership i think this ownership is doing some exciting things
1482772 if you wont let me play for you then let me play against you
1482773 it couldve been a lot worse the last time we had a big storm about three years ago my flight didnt make it my event had to go on without me and three days later i finally got to fly out so i consider this a blessing

1482934 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1482935 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1482936 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation

1482958 he told me if youre in the neighborhood he had a small studio in an apartment just a little hobbit hut
1482959 he had notebooks and notebooks of arms legs and drapery it all had slashes of black to indicate the drapery
1482960 most of the artists after ditko copied it or ignored it and used flashes of light that didnt mean anything
1482961 sin city anyone this is marv in the electric chair before there was a marv in the electric chair
1482962 it was followed by the sad day when john romita took over amazing

1482974 as things look at the moment i would say yes but we just have to sit down in the morning and see what happens
1482975 that was the first time my players had played in glasgow with an atmosphere like the one at ibrox
1482976 the first leg for us was the dangerous one because we dont have 40 000 supporters we wanted a good result and 0 0 was a good result for us
1482977 the team always believed it was possible in their home park but rangers were still the favourites before this match

1482985 most of us though have a critical reality monitoring function so that we are able to distinguish well enough between what is real and what is imagined and our imagination does not have too great an impact on our lives unless the reality check system breaks down such as after stroke or in cases of schizophrenia

1483098 young gore sets out for his new home where the sky is clear the water is clean and there are no republicans
1483099 former vice president al gore who for the past three decades has unsuccessfully attempted to warn humanity of the coming destruction of our planet only to be mocked and derided by the very people he has tried to save launched his infant son into space monday in the faint hope that his only child would reach the safety of another world
1483100 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
1483101 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
1483102 this is no fantasy no careless product of wild imagination no my friends these indictments that i have brought to you today specific charges herein against the individuals their acts of treason their ultimate aim of sedition these are matters of undeniable fact i ask you now to pronounce judgment on those accused
1483103 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1483104 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1483105 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1483106 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1483107 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1483108 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1483109 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1483110 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1483111 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1483112 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1483113 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1483114 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1483115 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1483116 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1483117 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1483118 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1483119 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1483120 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1483121 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1483122 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1483123 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1483124 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1483125 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1483126 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1483127 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1483128 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1483129 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1483130 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1483131 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1483132 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1483133 as a great admirer of the royal family i was disgusted to see that two of the animals in
1483134 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1483135 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1483136 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1483137 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1483138 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1483139 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1483140 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1483141 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1483142 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1483143 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1483144 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1483145 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1483146 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1483147 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1483148 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1483149 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1483150 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1483151 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1483152 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1483153 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1483154 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1483155 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1483156 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1483157 weve stopped thinking in terms of hillary people and obama people what was good about this was that we got everybody involved
1483158 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1483159 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1483160 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1483161 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1483162 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1483163 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1483164 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1483165 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1483166 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1483167 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1483168 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1483169 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1483170 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1483171 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1483172 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1483173 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1483174 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
1483175 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
1483176 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1483177 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1483178 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1483179 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1483180 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1483181 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1483182 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1483183 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1483184 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1483185 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1483186 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1483187 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1483188 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1483189 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1483190 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1483191 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1483192 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1483193 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1483194 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1483195 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1483196 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1483197 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1483198 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1483199 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1483200 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1483201 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1483202 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1483203 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1483204 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1483205 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1483206 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1483207 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1483208 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1483209 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1483210 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1483211 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1483212 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1483213 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1483214 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1483215 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1483216 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1483217 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1483218 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1483219 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1483220 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1483221 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1483222 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1483223 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1483224 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1483225 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1483226 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1483227 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1483228 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1483229 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1483230 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1483231 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1483232 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1483233 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1483234 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1483235 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1483236 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1483237 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1483238 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1483239 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1483240 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1483241 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1483242 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1483243 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1483244 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1483245 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1483246 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1483247 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1483248 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1483249 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1483250 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1483251 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1483252 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1483253 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1483254 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1483255 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1483256 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1483257 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1483258 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1483259 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1483260 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1483261 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1483262 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1483263 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1483264 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1483265 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1483266 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1483267 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1483268 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1483269 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1483270 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1483271 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1483272 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1483273 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1483274 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1483275 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1483276 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1483277 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1483278 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1483279 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1483280 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1483281 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1483282 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
1483283 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1483284 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1483285 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1483286 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1483287 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1483288 i didnt read all the specifics of his plan i agree with his goal i may disagree on all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue
1483289 i am in no way trying to get in a fight with gore because we share the same goal
1483290 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1483291 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1483292 there is an alchemy in sorrow it can be transmuted into wisdom which if it does not bring joy can yet bring happiness
1483293 to show that he is a regular guy despite a perceived surplus of gravitas which at least some americans seem to find intimidating
1483294 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1483295 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1483296 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1483297 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1483298 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1483299 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1483300 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1483301 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1483302 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1483303 honest fellas i wasnt trying to hit nobody i just really really really suck as a pitcher
1483304 what happens if your kite gets tangled in somebody elses
1483305 most modern players are aware of the realism and skill of the pro evolution soccer series
1483306 it is a game that truly mirrors the pace and control of real football and as a die hard fan of the series i am delighted to be working with konami on the latest version
1483307 the united states military has had no better supporter and stronger friend than senator ted stevens
1483308 it is best to defeat the enemy overseas so we do not have to face them here in the united states
1483309 i believe theres an almighty and i believe a gift of that almighty to every man woman an child on the face of the earth is freedom
1483310 its in our national interest to help others realize the blessings of a free society
1483311 may god bless you and may god continue to bless the united states of america
1483312 oh que nombre tan original jefe que magnifica idea ha tenido es usted muy listo c mo se le habr ocurrido en fin tremendo el caso es que nos pasamos la vida diciendo manzana manzana manzana que es el significado de apple por si hay alguno que no lo sabe
1483313 said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq
1483314 intended to influence u s political processes public opinion policies or media
1483315 i saw probably the worst thing ive seen in 20 years of policing
1483316 i dont care who they are if they have information no matter how insignificant it may seem it could be important to us
1483317 cause i had mine out while i was looking at yours
1483318 he is very much i want to get better i want to get better fast
1483319 he pushes the expectations that the family has given him
1483320 he is so thankful for the people that came to his aid and worked as fast as they did to help him
1483321 hes optimistic and ready to do what he has to do to get out of there
1483322 in buying the copyright we felt we needed to retain an element of control over the signs to maintain westminsters image as a world class tourist destination
1483323 i dont want to read this on your website i want to read it in my rss reader
1483324 its more important that your material gets read than it gets read in the way that you dictate
1483325 we had a high hurdle to overcome and that of course was the finances
1483326 sometimes people are intimidated to come back to the big campus we give them the confidence here to go on to be the successes they dreamed of being
1483327 the familiarity of a neighborhood and a neighborhood setting can make all the difference
1483328 the economy is a little bit tough for fundraising right now
1483329 we truly are committed to this block being a catalyst for change in the community
1483330 grand rapids community college is providing us today with a bridge to our future
1483331 were trying to be that educational piece that the community has asked us to be
1483332 have teamed up with politically correct busybodies to use our own laws to undermine our freedoms especially our freedom to criticize them

1483436 they continue to say the jury is still out for men under 75
1483437 there are many doctors who believe staunchly that psa testing should be done in all men and there are probably an equal number of doctors who believe very much that testing is of limited value

1483509 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1483510 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1483511 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1483512 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1483513 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1483526 whos that stupid traditional agency to judge the unparraleled brilliance of my interactive idea when they dont know s about interactive or the specific nuances of the digital ecosphere

1483531 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work and i truly understand that if i was in mikes shoes id see it basically the same way he sees it im sure and i think if he was in my shoes hed see it my way i think we both agree on that they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1483548 the international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former yugoslavia since 1991
1483549 wilful killing wilfully causing great suffering and serious injury to body and health employment of poisonous weapons and other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering wanton destruction of cities towns and villages unlawful attacks on civilian objects devastation not necessitated by military objectives attacks on undefended buildings and dwellings destruction and wilful damage done to institutions dedicated to religion charity and education the arts and sciences
1483550 not only a requirement of law it is a requirement of justice to the victims and of deterrence to powerful countries such as those in nato who in their military might and in their control over the media are lacking in any other natural restraint such as might deter less powerful countries
1483551 by holding individuals accountable regardless of their position the ictys work has dismantled the tradition of impunity for war crimes and other serious violations of international law particularly by individuals who held the most senior positions
1483552 until i hear from dr andrews thats all ive got

1483556 im a gamer and the chance to act in one of the best loved game franchises was an opportunity i was really keen to explore especially as eva is such a strong female character
1483557 we never intended to make an album at first in fact we were going to have a year off
1483558 falling oil prices how cheaper oil prices can hurt you
1483559 sadly no solution has been found and so we have no alternative than to shut the servers down in 48 hours
1483560 we gave it everything we had and history now judges that it still wasnt good enough
1483561 never place hands or foreign objects in water or try to touch the fish this is very harmful to them
1483562 i think in the world today it doesnt make a difference to the consumer if a record comes out on warner music emi red bull or diesel jeans artists may be better advised to put their music out with a brand to get better reach and bigger advertising
1483563 so one way to test it is to enter information about a more mature startup that was true prior to funding and see how well it predicts the actual results
1483564 the mobile phone came of age in china when the earthquake ripped through sichuan province victims used their phones to call for rescue soldiers used civilian networks to organize supplies families used text messages to exchange news of survival or loss and an increasingly angry group of citizens spread word of protests against corruption and lax building standards the national conversation kept going thanks to a military style logistics operation by the rival phone companies so integrated is the mobile communications device into chinese society that the authorities have been puzzling for ages over the best way to channel investment for the future but the government may soon discover that regulating the telecoms providers is a minor challenge compared with controlling the citizens who will ultimately use their services to communicate with each other
1483565 the ability of the chinese government to spy on the countrys 500 million mobile phone users
1483566 wang jianzhou head of mobile stunned delegates to the world economic forum in davos by revealing that the company had unlimited access to the personal data of its 300mm customers and handed it over to chinese security officials when demanded we know who you are but also where you are said the ceo

1483571 our goal is to provide new zealanders with the best possible news service anytime and anywhere
1483572 it is fantastic to see new zealanders continuing to turn to one news in ever increasing numbers with the beijing games and the new zealand election ahead kiwis can be assured we will continue to bring them the news they need to know
1483573 i think its a very well done and justifiable recommendation
1483574 they continue to say the jury is still out for men under 75
1483575 there are many doctors who believe staunchly that psa testing should be done in all men and there are probably an equal number of doctors who believe very much that testing is of limited value
1483576 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1483577 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1483578 it would be a disservice to patients to have their chronological age be the only factor making important health decisions
1483579 there are some very young 75 year olds out there
1483580 feel liberated from having to have the test its one less thing for people over 75 to worry about
1483581 hopefully within the next three or four years we will have some outcomes from those studies and be able to give a little more definitive guidance to men and physicians
1483582 ive got a job to do and i intend to keep doing it

1483587 the market is clearly in transition and we will use this time as an opportunity to expand our share of customer spend and to aggressively move into market adjacencies
1483588 our overall customer activity was solid even as our customers absorbed the effects of a challenging macroeconomic environment

1483590 the challenge of innovation is that we are all boxed in by what we know by our assumptions about how things work the next google like innovation is right in front of us we just need to see past our own assumptions
1483591 it just says things are still weak are going to stay weak for a long time on the other hand though its not getting particularly worse
1483592 speaking of the emerging market for web based advertising on mobile phones schmidt said the vast majority of google searches on mobile phones were done on apple incs year old iphones which prominently feature a web browser
1483593 i think its one of those places that theres i think a handful of guys or 10 guys 12 guys that really like going to the glen and like going to sonoma calif and look forward to those races
1483594 then theres probably half the field that can take it or leave it then theres a quarter of the field that would be fine if we didnt go
1483595 as soon as you get out of the glen thats when you want to be on that hot streak
1483596 it never hurts winning races and if you win at the glen thats just that much more momentum the next week
1483597 we went to road atlanta last week and i felt like we had a promising test
1483598 i feel like we learned some things that will gain us a little speed here i love racing at watkins glen its fast and its a track that suits our cars very very well
1483599 you have to outbreak guys into the corners which is really the only way you can pass
1483600 and when you do that youre taking risks you can miss a shift you can wheel hop you can get into somebody lock a wheel up whatever so a lot times when we see altercations on a road course its somebody making a bold move and it doesnt work
1483601 sponsors and everybody want to be involved with a team that can win races
1483602 i look at this weekend as an opportunity of putting our team in victory lane theres only been three teams this year that have been in victory lane so if we could pull it off that would be big
1483603 cheating the bad things good nascar nextel cup racers do in pursuit of speed

1483618 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
1483619 reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again
1483620 we are appealing it because i think that is too much for me
1483621 im disappointed because im hurt i got left hand hurt and my right hand i know im going to get suspended but not like for five days maybe three or two games i agree with that but five games i think is a lot
1483622 i dont ever look forward to being away from the competition it is their decision i dont have the advantage of the appeal process so ive got to serve mine tonight
1483623 it seemed to me to be like a product of extreme sexism and i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1483624 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a nonstory
1483625 its just silly because the way people are talking about it youd think it was a bertolucci movie or something
1483626 were just recently very recently engaged so you know were just taking it easy and no big plan yet but its a good time and were just enjoying our time to be young and engaged
1483627 this may have been rogerss singular gift an extraordinary ability to read the anxieties of others and to offer a suitable version of himself to fit the situation
1483628 my only regret is that i have never found that special one to grow old with and watch the sunset with
1483629 i dont its just a little disagreement i apologize for the way it went down but i dont apologize for the passion and intensity i definitely could have handled it a little better but just at that moment thats how it went down i cant take it back the way i handled it probably could have been dealt with better
1483630 i want guys that compete i want guys that play with fire and passion and sometimes when you do things like that happen
1483631 id much rather deal with this than a bunch of guys sitting on the bench getting their butts kicked every day and not caring about it to be honest with you
1483632 it looks like if this follows suit all of the current athletic programs will stay in place
1483633 sports is part of the curriculum its as significant as the enrichment the art the music all of those are intrical parts of our curriculum im highly supportive of all of those and would have hated to have any of those affected by our cuts
1483634 despite an assurance made by the dnc and obama campaign to widely dispatch campaign surrogates to their platform meetings few campaign representatives appear to have shown up to the hundreds of events held nationwide
1483635 the obama campaign and the dnc will send policy experts and dnc platform committee members to as many meetings as possible to serve as facilitators
1483636 it should come as no surprise that these meetings attracted some aspiring democratic politicians especially those in red states
1483637 it was in my home in westfield indiana that a couple of dozen republicans for obama met to socialize and discuss the issues on the democratic platform in 2008
1483638 according to reports coming in from our special ops members more than half of the obama and dnc platform meetings were held in private residences many of which were described as middle to upper class homes maybe thats because organizers need enough space for an average of 20 people to comfortably meet
1483639 wheres your flag pin and why do you hate america barack obama
1483640 we are carefully evaluating all aspects of our operations in the uk

1483650 coach blair has led our womens basketball program to the heights we knew he would reach upon his hiring five years ago
1483651 our first ever ncaa elite eight appearance in april exceeded expectations we could have only imagined before the hiring of coach blair and his staff
1483652 he is a great ambassador of the womens game who continues to produce winners in the classroom and on the court coach blair is a proven winner himself and i see our programs success continuing for years to come
1483653 our guys were a little more aggressive as far as what we were going to take away from them
1483654 they made some slight adjustments we had to adjust to those but our guys pretty much carried out our game plan all night long
1483655 my teammates and my coach told me to be aggressive
1483656 i knew when i got into the lane i had to shoot the ball im just trying to lead my team in the playoffs its just my third year i have got a long way to go

1483681 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1483682 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1483683 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1483684 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1483685 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1483686 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1483687 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1483688 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1483689 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1483690 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1483691 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1483692 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1483693 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1483694 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1483695 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1483696 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1483697 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1483698 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1483699 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1483700 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1483701 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1483702 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1483703 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1483704 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1483705 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1483706 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1483707 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11

1483711 i just met your beautiful wife backstage i worship her ill babysit
1483712 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1483713 its just a bad time to have to go through something like this
1483714 ive always said in order for us to be really what we need to be we need other guys to be able to close games i didnt know we would be forced into that
1483715 its going to be important that some guys step up
1483716 ive closed a few games before so that definitely helps did it a little bit in college
1483717 i work hard for those moments i like those moments its special today thats what i want to do try to help the team win
1483718 the most important thing to me is to stay healthy
1483719 my health is good i can do whatever i can to help the team win im very happy im back in the lineup
1483720 it changes the game hes one of the big superstars in the game i think moreso than his ability to hit the ball out of the ballpark he loosens us up with his charisma and character before and after the game hes a huge part of who we are
1483721 he didnt really have good command ill say that much and sometimes when you dont have command and you dont make quality pitches it hurts you sometimes
1483722 to come back and clear my name is important to me
1483723 theres not many jobs where you make this kind of money
1483724 he finishes every run within his individual drills i see the guy working hard to get better
1483725 i think the guy shows up each day and he has a purpose when he practices
1483726 thats always going to be in the back of some peoples minds can the guy make it
1483727 we know that when ricky williams gets on the field and suits up that hes going to give you 100 percent effort and you know that hes going to go to the wall for you
1483728 hes an unbelievable player but its just keeping him on the field its like one of those things you have to show me you have to go out and give me a full season i dont think anybodys worried about it but its just a matter of him going out and getting it done

1483733 the role that elected officials play in our society makes it all the more imperative that they be allowed freely to express themselves on matters of current public importance
1483734 to preserve affordable local public transportation that allows seniors and people with disabilities to remain independent and all money staying local
1483735 its very important for the choreographer dancer entertainer to get out there and show your talent any way you can
1483736 it can be tough financially you work until youre 25 or 30 if youre lucky and your knees dont blow out being a dancer is a wonderful thing but i emphasize to students that theyre a creative being and they have to find the thing they can grow into maybe youll get a love for directing or producing maybe it will be set design art direction whatever it is its necessary to have your mind open to that early on
1483737 media choreographers have to become entrepreneurs because they have no protection
1483738 now every network is begging for the next dance opportunity everywhere you look its thriving and pulling in enormous numbers
1483739 i wish someone out there would look at this incredible collection of artists and say let us help take care of you with pensions protections and security
1483740 doing a show like dancing with the stars is pretty much the most famous you can get as a dancer unless youre baryshnikov or something
1483741 even the people who dont make it to the finals or win go on to have great careers its just so much exposure
1483742 im not going to make an apology for something that the ioc is not responsible for
1483743 we are not running the internet in china the chinese authorities are running the internet
1483744 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
1483745 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
1483746 a lot of work still needs to be done for the campaign to eliminate hepatitis b and have all of the residents of san francisco tested and vaccinated

1483766 theyve passed or caught pretty near everybody ive been hooked with and thats kind of nice

1483857 i was merely trying to express my delight at obamas commitment to his campaign in every aspect and his interest and his support in his surrogates and his staff and his fellows and how wonderful and refreshing that is and it was manipulated into such an unfortunate media frenzy of kind of a non story

1483932 since friday the republicans in congress have been playing to the television cameras with theatrical stunts because speaker pelosi blocked their offshore drilling plan the republican plan will not lower gas prices but it will line the pockets of big oil executives the same people donating millions of dollars to republicans

1483935 this is a major message to america and america is listening
1483936 with such prevalent ad skipping and format substitution prices for ads will inevitably decline as advertisers question the value of traditional tv commercials and reallocate their marketing spend to new channels with better targeting and measurement capabilities
1483937 given the explosion in content and the frustration many viewers express in being able to find something to watch a superior search and discovery experience offers one of the biggest opportunities for delivering value to customers
1483938 so the production offset from inflating tires is more likely to approach 800 thousand barrels per day a tidy sum and a worthwhile target for savings but not equal to ocs output
1483939 finally without knowing what production volumes could be expected from lifting the ban on ocs drilling moratoria its impossible to assert that taking these fuel savings actions would exceed future offshore oil volumes and in fact one might argue that the combination of achieving these savings and developing new supply would doubly enhance us energy security
1483940 breaking our oil addiction will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1483941 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1483942 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long
1483943 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1483944 tony blair was told by mi6 before the invasion of iraq that a high placed and potentially credible iraqi source was saying that saddam hussein had no weapons of mass destruction intelligence that was passed to the us but buried by the white house

1483957 those who miss the operations in the gaza strip dont worry they will come
1483958 dont worry we will continue to kill scores of palestinians
1483959 the soaring price of oil will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget surplus of as much as 79 billion by years end an american federal oversight agency has concluded in an analysis released on tuesday
1483960 every time bush threatens iran by saying that all options are on the table including the military one oil spikes
1483961 prices would go a lot higher and stay there too if the market really believed that an attack on iran were imminent
1483962 the message is clear the additional energy we need in 2050 over the current 13 5 tw base is simply not attainable from long discussed sources the global appetite for energy is simply too great
1483963 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein

1483966 i dont want to say its much ado about nothing but we think its overblown a bit
1483967 but losing a player of james magnitude would be nothing short of a nightmare for the nba
1483968 for the most part the league considers the players to be fungible products
1483969 but lebron is one of the three or four players the league would definitely hate to lose if a team lost him or kobe bryant to europe it would lose its mind it would be devastating
1483970 it would be disappointing to lose one of our star players but i have no concern at all about the best players playing anywhere but in the nba for a long time to come
1483971 id be surprised if one of our top players chose to go to europe but if it did happen there are many players who would step up and fill the void
1483972 first of all we dont know that theres going to be a 50 million offer

1484202 it may sound like a good deal but it isnt due to the additional fees charged
1484203 skillful money management doesnt mean cutting out those fun things in your life

1484353 food safety and food preservation thats where extension has its niche
1484354 some days you come in and do planning for programs or you might come in and some major thing has happened and youve got calls coming in like when the powers out and people are calling to see if its still safe to keep their food
1484355 she understands how easy it is to slip away from an exercise routine
1484356 we do things like set up fruits and vegetable stations and let kids try fruits and vegetables they may have never had
1484357 we had three classes on food safety in one we did the glow germ activity we put orange lotion on their hands then had them wash their hands then we used a black light to show them what areas they missed washing
1484358 janelle saw the need to teach nutrition in the schools and she got the grant for that
1484359 she just has an impeccable work ethic she really dots every i and crosses every t
1484360 janelle is very quiet and unassuming but she has lots of innovative ideas
1484361 she really has the people of stokes at heart because shes one of them
1484362 shes very reserved but when it comes to her programs that passion really comes out
1484363 i like helping people learn new skills theres never a dull moment
1484364 i have been walking around like a zombie my husband is in hospice right now
1484365 this is so absurd its obvious she is not a terrorist or an alien
1484366 the implementation of it borders on the absurd in some cases
1484367 unfortunately certain other people are getting caught in the tail wind
1484368 people in oregon who have lived here 50 years or all of their life are the most likely to be affected
1484369 women who have been married and changed their names also appear to have the most difficulty
1484370 everyones in full agreement we should have control of our borders
1484371 people who have lived here a long time or all of their lives have never had to face it
1484372 you hear stories about people in their homes making decisions about buying food or medications they are sitting there with no food in the house
1484373 its not necessarily always about money sometimes its just they cant get out of the house they dont know who to call who to trust a lot of medical conditions can cause them to be very confused and weak and tired
1484374 its a very nominal fee to become a member but you become part of this resource pool
1484375 churches need help with working with their seniors how to run a day care how to run a meals on wheels program
1484376 i was very excited because i think its something thats needed and long overdue
1484377 we will have a newsletter that we will send by e mail immediately we are going to make it easier for people to access information
1484378 when you get all the agencies serving seniors working together much like the childrens alliance i think you work smarter and achieve more working together than working individually
1484379 having everyone working together we see the bigger picture and better see where the gaps are and hopefully work to fill those gaps
1484380 thats one of the main reasons for this group is you have to look at the community and private funding to help make up the difference
1484381 the iocs priority is to ensure that as many people as possible get to experience the magic of the olympic games and the inspirational sporting achievements of the olympic athletes
1484382 for the first time in olympic history we will have complete global online coverage and the ioc will have its own broadcast channel and content production facilities
1484383 the iocs channel will make fantastic olympic footage available where young generations of sports fans are already going for online entertainment and will complement the footage offered in these territories by our broadcast partners across all media platforms
1484384 usually in the movies they say give me the money but they tried to kill us from the very start it happened really fast they ran in holding the knife out and started trying to chop me

1484463 national socialist legislation has intervened in a corrective manner against jewish foreign infiltration i say corrective since the fact that jewry is not for example being ruthlessly exterminated in national socialist germany is proven by the fact that in prussia alone 33 500 jews are active in industry and handicrafts 98 900 in trade and transport and is further proven by the fact that with a proportion of 1 of the population of germany 17 5 of all lawyers are still jewish and for example in berlin almost 50 of all non aryan physicians are still permitted to participate in the social security system

1484465 today i will once more be a prophet if the international jewish financiers in and outside europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war then the result will not be the bolshevization of the earth and thus the victory of jewry but the annihilation of the jewish race in europe
1484466 for the time when the non jewish nations had no propaganda is at an end national socialist germany and fascist italy have institutions which enable them when necessary to enlighten the world about the nature of a question of which many nations are instinctively conscious but which they have not yet clearly thought out
1484467 and i should like to repeat the warning that i have already once given on 1 september 1939 correct jan 30 1939 in the german reichstag namely the warning that if jewry drives the world into a general war the role jewry plays in europe will be all over
1484468 the bolshevik method of physical annihilation of a people as un germanic
1484469 this race of criminals has the two million dead of the first world war on their conscience and now hundreds of thousands more let no one say how can we ship them off into the swamps
1484470 beginning in lublin the jews are now being deported from the generalgouvernement to the east this is a somewhat barbaric procedure and not one to be further described here there is not much left of the jews themselves in general one can state that 60 percent will have to be liquidated only 40 percent will be able to be put to work
1484471 the jewish question must be solved within the framework of greater europe there are still over 11 million jews in europe they must first be concentrated in the east eventually after the war they can be sent to an island like madagascar at any rate there will be no peace in europe until the jews are completely excluded from the european territory
1484472 i am thinking now of the evacuation of the jews the extermination of the jewish people it is one of those things that is easy to say the jewish people will be exterminated says every party comrade that is quite clear it is in our program deactivation ausschaltung of the jews extermination that is what we are doing and then they all come along these 80 million good germans and every one of them has his decent jew of course it is quite clear that the others are pigs but this one is one first class jew of all those who speak this way not one has looked on not one has lived through it most of you know what it means when 100 bodies lie together when 500 lie there or if 1 000 lie there to have gone through this and at the same time apart from exceptions caused by human weaknesses to have remained decent that has made us hard this is a chapter of glory in our history which has never been written and which never shall be written since we know how hard it would be for us if we still had the jews as secret saboteurs agitators and slander mongers among us now in every city during the bombing raids with the suffering and deprivations of the war we would probably already be in the same situation as in 1916 17 if we still had the jews in the body of the german people we had the moral right we had the duty to our own people to kill this people which wanted to kill us
1484473 the jewish question in europe has completely changed the f hrer once said in a reichstag speech if jewry triggers an international war for example to exterminate the aryan people then it wont be the aryans who will be exterminated but jewry the jews have been resettled outside germany they are living here in the east and are working on our roads railways etc this is a consistent process but is conducted without cruelty

1484476 we know how the red army behaved in poland in 1920 and in finland estonia latvia galicia and bessarabia only recently we must therefore take into account how the red army will certainly behave when it overruns central europe experience has shown that the best distraction is atrocity propaganda directed against the enemy unfortunately the public is no longer so susceptible as in the days of the corpse factory and the mutilated belgian babies and the crucified canadians 143 142 edward j rozek allied wartime diplomacy john wiley amp sons new york 1958 pp 209f your cooperation is therefore earnestly sought to distract public attention from the doings of the red army by your wholehearted support of various charges against the germans and japanese which have been and will be put into circulation by the ministry
1484477 all the propaganda that now began to circulate about auschwitz in foreign countries originated with us assisted by our polish comrades
1484478 i believe it is no exaggeration if i say that the biggest part of auschwitz propaganda which was spread in the world around that time has been written by us in the camp
1484479 it is no exaggeration if i say that the largest part of publications about auschwitz spread in the world around that time originated with us
1484480 we spread this propaganda to the public at large until the very last day of our stay in auschwitz
1484481 until the last day of our stay in auschwitz we informed the public at large in this way
1484482 on another occasion when the crematoria became too full to accommodate the thousands of jews streaming into the camp he had trenches dug which were then filled with gasoline and set ablaze
1484483 while it is nearly impossible to distinguish among mengeles murderous acts as to which ones were worse than others perhaps one incident exemplifies the demonic nature of the man perhaps better than most
1484484 after a while a large group of ss officers arrived on motorcycles mengele among them they drove into the yard and got off their motorcycles upon arriving they circled the flames it sic burned horizontally we watched to see what would follow after a while trucks arrived dump trucks with children inside there were about ten of these trucks after they had entered the yard an officer gave an order and the trucks backed up to the fire and they started throwing those children right into the fire into the pit the children started to scream some of them managed to crawl out of the burning pit an officer walked around it with sticks and pushed back those who managed to get out hoess the auschwitz commandant and mengele were present and were giving orders
1484485 such behavior was possible because he was simply an embodiment of evil and there is no psychological way of explaining how he became so

1484716 one of the pleasant surprises is the defensive line their intensity trying to develop that depth davis said tuesday
1484717 marvin austin is obviously doing a very good job but aleric mullins and tydreke powell and cam thomas all four of those guys are going to be extraordinarily instrumental to having a good rotation inside
1484718 at the defensive ends e j wilson had an outstanding practice yesterday he was bigger stronger physicaler at the point of attack greg elleby is doing some good stuff so the defensive line is off to a really good start
1484719 hes not shown any kind of ill effects davis said
1484720 so our speculation is that he went through the worst of it this past spring and he should be fine for the rest of the fall
1484721 we never hit cam sexton or mike paulus or braden hanson or any of the other quarterbacks in this program davis said
1484722 they get grabbed from time to time and they get under pressure but as far as taking a chance on hitting them somebody else is going to have to run that drill not me
1484723 and the snaps a couple of times they were three four five inches off target but they were able to get the ball down and get the ball spun and give the kicker the confidence to go ahead and not worry about the placement so that part was good

1484748 the fans of the houston texans are not passionate the fans of the arizona cardinals are not passionate i mean i came out here this morning and all you see are people who are just nutty about the redskins theyre out of their minds theyre crazy
1484749 dear sucking master it has come to my attention that you dont think texans fans are passionate apparently we do not consume our team with the same joie de vivre with which you consume metric tons of frosting and brett favres i find this rather interesting in the same way i find a monkey playing with his own interesting mainly because it makes no sense whatsoever you
1484750 if your idea of evoking passion was to piss off the texans nation en masse mission accomplished you ing east coast hack hole
1484751 im a texan peter king and youre not so dont knock what you dont understand texans fans have suffered like no other nfl fan before them and were still here as indestructible as ever what doesnt kill you only makes you stronger and the great fans of the houston texans are as strong as they come
1484752 i think you think houston fans arent passionate because you never gets death threats or hate mail from us i wonder why that is could it be because you rarely find the space in your 8000 word columns about the texans but find plenty of room to discuss comfortable texture of brett favres chest hair and your favorite coffee shops all the while relaying about how the old lady in front of you cant seem to order a latte and operate her cell phone at the same time
1484753 het aantal moorden op journalisten is inderdaad afgenomen maar het journalistieke klimaat is er ondertussen helemaal niet vrijer op geworden sterker nog het aantal bedreigingen is juist toegenomen dat er niet meer journalisten zijn vermoord komt omdat ze zich vaak al op voorhand censureren
1484754 in kleinere gemeenschappen zijn de banden nauwer en op het platteland speelt het conflict tussen guerilla leger en gedemobiliseerde paramilitairen
1484755 veel journalisten branden hun vingers daarom liever niet aan verhalen over drugssmokkel paramilitaire activiteiten en corruptie veruit de gevaarlijkste onderwerpen om over te berichten

1484927 we like to expose kids to everything but sometimes theres not a direct correlation to whats actually happening in the classroom and so we have to be careful of that we all have to be mindful of the gas situation the costs and trying to make the budget balance
1484928 theres many children that wont be exposed to that because of economic constraints that they wouldnt be able to go to the ballet and the symphony or no i think its a real shame were cutting those

1484932 the most important things for parents are calendars and tools for media sharing

1484957 all of a sudden this year a lot of stuff has been breaking loose
1484958 owning the windows pc is not really a priority anymore
1484959 our intention is to really put more value at that price point and offer some amazing proposition to companies
1484960 we expect to hold the price point and add more and more value at that price point
1484961 we want to have commercial relationships with lots of companies and it matters more that we have that than exactly how much dollar per user were getting
1484962 we can certainly hold that price point we can continue to put more capabilities there the cost of an additional application to us is tiny its hardly material there are certainly types of applications that we could add that would add cost and we would price appropriately but i dont expect the price to climb that wouldnt be my expectation

1484978 it was very scary and i will not let her go back outside like this again
1484979 this is a crucial issue for archaeology because if chickens were in south america before the spanish arrived it means people must have brought them there across the breadth of the pacific ocean
1484980 we know there was at least some contact between pre european polynesians and americans because the south american sweet potato occurs in polynesia and the bottle gourd from asia and ultimately africa occurs in south america
1484981 however to date there has been no conclusive archaeological evidence for the presence of polynesians in south america making recent claims for presence of pre columbian chickens in south america a key issue
1484982 the study found no support for previous claims for a polynesian introduction of chickens to south america
1484983 this does not mean that polynesians and people in the americas did not have contact in the past just that the current archaeological evidence does not suggest that chickens were part of the package
1484984 when the brand name is entered as a keyword in a search the scam ad appears hijacking the consumer to the competitors site
1484985 there are deceptive ads that promise free credit reports that are not free and others that promise free ring tones that cost 10 a month
1484986 my sense is that there are an awful lot of scams out there online and more and more of them are reaching users through search engines it seems like a better design for the future of the internet to have search engines step up and take greater responsibility rather than for users to have to take such great precautions with real costs like the costs of getting victimized and losing money

1484995 doesnt it hurt just a little to know that google is the leader in the silverlight advertising space before your company has even scratched the surface
1484996 surely it would make some sense to take control of the silverlight advertising space in a big way wouldnt it once again google has pulled the wool over microsofts eyes and the company is in the dark circling around wondering how in the world itll be able to beat google on something anything
1484997 if this isnt the catalyst microsoft needs i dont know what is
1484998 not only being boxed out of the advertising space all over the web but now its being boxed out of advertising on its own platform without even harnessing its power to fight back
1484999 microsofts very own platform is already being hijacked by its biggest competitor and it better move fast if it doesnt want to be pushed out of that advertising space too
1485000 why microsoft is not utilizing silverlight 2 to serve video ads coming from its advertising inventory
1485001 microsoft has so wanted to catch up on google in terms of its advertising business

1485331 hitn was founded 25 years ago as a response to the lack of educational programming available to hispanics now just as then there is still a tremendous need for the type of programming we provide

1485387 as far as the dripping technique goes id like to say that i dont use it as a technique per se pollock for example used it as a totally innovative technique but i wasnt even aware of it when i started to paint like that i simply paint on a canvas on the floor and what you see from the outside as dripping isnt really dripping they are accidents that happen when i am over the canvas the paint drips a lot while i put on a colour of course i realize this afterwards but i dont do this consciously to create an accident the drips exist in my time and space and since gravity also exists they fall and i accept them as they are many times i like the accidents more that i like what i unconsciously want to do lastly it seems to me that eastern and traditional art is purer even though this doesnt mean anything its neither better nor worse my work at the same time also co exists with both cultures thats normal because ive been in both in the west and in the east i was born in the city of istanbul which is the gateway between east and west

1485421 in my job i have been lucky enough to spend time with and get to know many amazing artists this has allowed me to gain a different and valuable perspective on the art market that has given me a much greater appreciation and understanding of the often complex relationships between artists collectors and dealers
1485422 as an art consultant and art collector i have experienced the lack of information and guidance on art investment and the art market from both sides of the fence this was so frustrating that i decided to share my experiences and the knowledge that i had gained with others the purpose of the art market blog http www artmarketblog com is to demystify the art market and to provide clear and honest information on art as an investment
1485423 i am also involved with visual arts copyright here in australia and will be part of the team that will shortly be implementing resale royalties in australia which will be a massive project i am also currently writing a book which will change the way people view and approach art as an investment
1485424 my primary interest is in the art market and i plan to be more involved in the valuation and consultative side of things in the near future
1485425 as an art collector and investor i am always looking for those artists that produce work that i think will stand the test of time and are not merely taking advantage of a trend or fad i see so many artworks that are empty and superficial so i get excited when i come across an artist that produces thought provoking interesting and timeless works of art that leave an impression long after viewing the work
1485426 the contemporary artist that i most admire would have to be cy twombly because of his seemingly uninhibited approach to the creation of art and the intensity and energy he creates in his work
1485427 the most difficult project i have been involved with has been the art market blog mainly because of the huge amount of time and effort that it takes to run i really enjoy running the art market blog and it is very satisfying so it is well worth the time and effort
1485428 according to the 5th century chinese art historian xie he the most important ingredients in a painting are spirit vitality and energy which are transmitted from the artist to the work i think that it is these aspects that differentiate a work of fine art from a merely decorative object
1485429 i think that the best way to learn about art and the art market is to talk to artists and other collectors which is why i would recommend taking some of the art appreciation classes and seminars that are offered at many public galleries as well as through auction houses such as sothebys and christies i would also recommend that anyone interested in the art market read publications such as art news the art newspaper and art and auction which not only provide information on artists and the art market but also list the best upcoming exhibitions and auctions
1485430 i think that contemporary art enthusiasts can look forward to artists continuing to experiment with new mediums and the continued strengthening of the market for photography and video art
1485431 macdougall auction house was established in 2004 by art collecting couple catherine and william macdougall it specializes on russian art from icons to contemporary in addition to its london base it has an office in paris and was the first foreign auction house to have representatives in moscow and kiev in june it opened new auction rooms in 30a charles ii st off st james square london
1485432 art market blog profiting from the rush for russian art
1485433 we found that when the experimenters mimicked yawning 21 out of 29 dogs showed contagious yawning so this is a very strong and reliable effect
1485434 none of the dogs in the control group yawned we know contagious yawning is linked to empathy so it may mean dogs can empathise well with humans but we need to do more tests to be sure
1485435 now an american holiday has been replaced by a muslim religious festival
1485436 the fact that he fired it was pretty unbelievable that no one was hurt
1485437 if you dont come with me bad things are going to happen
1485438 yes i took her and as long as you play by my rules she will come back unharmed and breathing however failure to abide by the rules will result in a bullet put in her head my rules do nothing sit there in silence and suffer
1485439 texas is grateful that this storm did not escalate to hurricane strength before making landfall on our shores
1485440 youll see some green up ideally if you get enough rain you can sustain a good bit of growth and maybe get some hay out of it
1485441 overall its just one of those years everybodys just hanging on living from one rain to the next
1485442 a tropical storm that has 45 mile per hour winds is just a rainstorm
1485443 is a meditation on the tension and desolation found on the shoulders of americas highways and interstates my photos challenge the viewer to slow down and witness scenes of futility playing out in an uneasy and alien space within these photos we see the faces of the stranded the evidence of lives broken down or lost on the side of the road these moments occur in full view of hundreds of people speeding past yet the images tell a solemn story of personal detachment and individual isolation from the broader society the work functions as a statement on contemporary america and the tenuousness of our faith in technology community and traditional institutions of support
1485444 masterpiece that shows the true potential of anime as an international art form
1485445 if youre looking for a unique anime with some real heart then definitely give this one a shot
1485446 theres really no way you can go wrong with this release
1485447 how could a labour government let it happen my husband was in the labour party the north east is a labour stronghold so much in the region depended on the bank yet the government did nothing for three days
1485448 when the news came my heart sank i knew it was over my husband who had only recently retired from the bank came home and reassured me that it would be ok he said it was well run but i had a bad feeling about the way news had leaked out
1485449 the next day was like a rollercoaster it was like landing in the twilight zone we couldnt believe that nothing was being done we were not economists but even we could see how serious the situation was getting and how letting northern rock suffer would have terrible consequences for all the other banks
1485450 in effect they are telling the valuer to pretend that nr is no longer a going concern this is clearly not the case when it was able to raise 25bn or more over two years on top of paying punitive interest
1485451 the continuing downward trend in consumer confidence is not surprising given the recent batch of poor economic data talk of the increasing chances of a recession more weakening in the housing market and the continuing rise of food and energy costs will have further dented confidence as will reports of job losses
1485452 the british economy is now teetering on the brink of recession we are now facing the consequences of an economy which has been driven on the back of an unsustainable level of debt for several years
1485453 as the credit binge ends we are now feeling the hangover after years of ignoring the instabilities in the economy gordon brown must act now to stop a slowdown becoming a recession
1485454 throughout his years at the treasury the prime minister has ignored britains manufacturing industry now with growth in the housing and financial services sectors stalled britain is paying the price for this neglect
1485455 while the uk cips markit report on services improved slightly in july the survey still suggests that the economy has just about ground to a halt with the manufacturing and construction surveys already released also remaining weak a weighted average of the surveys continues to suggest that gdp has stagnated
1485456 i love the house but we paid 151 000 and the mortgage is 168 500 we dont want to sell it but in any case the valuers say its now worth 150 000 we had to move to an interest only loan in april to cut costs but it is still costing us 150 a month more than before were on this rate for a year but now i worry that it wont get any better and we could be in this situation for years to come
1485457 every month we look around at mortgages and ive set northern rock on my google alerts page so i watch everything thats going on there were trying to do everything we can to keep the house
1485458 will be more prolonged than we thought a year ago it is important to be straight with people
1485459 stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers but removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1485460 the government estimates that 2 5 million families are living in fuel poverty yet despite the billions in profits the energy industry spends just 50m a year combating fuel poverty and has only agreed to raise this to 150m by 2010
1485461 it northern rock needs more shareholder capital it does not have shareholders so it has to come from us
1485462 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1485463 just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1485464 the board continues to believe that the company has a very strong future as an independent group
1485465 adeccos stated strategy is to expand its professional operations in the us europe and asia as well as looking at specialised general staffing companies
1485466 a deal of this size at this stage of the cycle is something of a brave move
1485467 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1485468 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1485469 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a bit
1485470 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job
1485471 legal amp general earns around 80 90 of its revenue in the uk that has been a very deliberate decision you need scale in this business you dont make money by having 100 small businesses we are number one or two in most of the areas we want to be in but we have started to think of where our growth is going to come from in five years time and our conclusion is that it will be in emerging markets
1485472 the economy is in a downturn but it is unclear how long or how deep it will be and there are risks to consumer spending and employment levels it is very difficult to see the exact shape of the adjustment currently taking place and it does make future planning very much more difficult
1485473 they had lethal metal hooks that we kids used to fight with
1485474 it was easier to write without them but it was thought it was best if we had attachments to make us look normal the truth was i looked like metal mickey
1485475 the philosophy at our school was that being disabled was bad so you must do all you could to appear not disabled
1485476 wed had it instilled in us that you must do all you can to fit into the world because thats how youre going to get on
1485477 ridiculous charade of pretending to be a non disabled person
1485478 it was my safety valve where i could be a disabled person
1485479 we couldnt get a meeting with the department so i thought lets organise a march
1485480 suddenly when they knew we were coming it was much easier to get a meeting
1485481 having that diversity of voices is one of the most powerful things
1485482 for disabled people non disabled society has created the barriers
1485483 we needed to shift away from the polemical painful discussions where all you hear is anger
1485484 it doesnt help parents or us as an organisation to move on
1485485 i think you and i are probably on the same side because you wouldnt have chosen to segregate your child youve done it because the system has let you and your child down
1485486 what we are asking is what can we do together with schools teachers and qualification bodies so that anyone that participates in education achieves not just academically but is also given the tools to be a citizen
1485487 the truth is that if you have inclusive education you wont need special schools but its not about closing schools overnight
1485488 im slapped in the face about the reality of disablism on a daily basis
1485489 i had the humiliation of an it support guy piggy back me down the stairs id never met him before
1485490 a day doesnt go by without someone asking me how did that happen
1485491 its a very nice thing that you do but im not sure we can trust our money to an organisation thats run by disabled people
1485492 thats why the award is so important for the campaign to succeed i need someone to assist me and put me in other peoples shoes
1485493 improving lives through healthcare recruitment education services facilitator anacostia dc ba in education human social services or 4 yrs exp providing training req military lifestyle exp amp comp ekaterinburg
1485494 he was very calm but i was extremely surprised i went straight home and switched on the news
1485495 i came in early the next morning and people were like zombies as we heard about the queues forming at branches and how the run on the bank was getting worse there was a feeling the bank was about to collapse
1485496 lots of people felt they had been let down by the directors that was their first thought not about the regulators or the government they asked why the board had paid themselves large bonuses only for us to almost go bust
1485497 people found themselves having quite a complicated relationship with the bank supporting the company on the one hand but not those running it
1485498 many of the people ive spoken to feel quite sick at what went on and will gladly take voluntary redundancy they want to get out and start afresh
1485499 people believe even after almost a year has passed that the decisions were made by the executives and they are the reason the company crashed and redundancy is looming
1485500 i dont have anti u s sentiment im just anti bush and anti lee myung bak
1485501 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well
1485502 the united states is not our enemy without the u s we will die
1485503 while there may be some who will protest i think you need to look at whats happening on the supermarket shelves
1485504 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1485505 the problems relating to affordability and tight lending conditions run pretty deep
1485506 probably the main help it would provide is in helping first time buyers coming up with the deposit they need to buy a house
1485507 they are in such a mess at the moment you wonder if they can afford it
1485508 in a weakening housing market stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers and the wider housing market
1485509 removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1485510 what i like about kevin is that he has got a view and i think that is going to be important in his captaincy
1485511 kevin will be different to michael vaughan because he is a different man michael had a style and it was very successful kevin will bring kevin pietersen which i think is crucial he will be his own man and that will be really important
1485512 coaches and captains will always have different views because we see the game from different places
1485513 my job is to support kevin a lot and help him kevin has views that are pretty forthright and right and we have to talk through them we then have to work out how we implement them and make them part of the fabric of the team and that will take place over the coming months
1485514 when we the selectors decided to offer kevin the captaincy the first thing i wanted to do was to sit down and talk to him about where he was coming from and what his views were on where the side should go and would they match with mine
1485515 we talked openly and we were coming from the same place there is lots of work to do to achieve some of those things kevin will need support from me at times and i will need support from him and that is the way the coach player relationship should work by the end of it we felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away and i think kevin was the same quite buoyant and excited over what the future might hold
1485516 nobody could have predicted that we would be where we are now a week ago
1485517 when i first came in to the job i envisaged michael taking england through to the 2009 ashes but you have to respect the decision of someone who has played for and captained england as long as he has and i do totally
1485518 i had no idea michael was about to stand down at the weekend
1485519 i did not try to talk him out of it
1485520 i respect the way he went about it the key now for me is to look forward to getting kevin established and moving the team forward it is a different but exciting time
1485521 its undeniably going to have an impact but its there for everyone to deal with
1485522 its been part of our forward planning some people are more susceptible than others weve done tests on all the athletes it will play a part but i dont think it will be decisive
1485523 those standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so
1485524 im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1485525 i suspect it was their choice you would have to talk to them as to what prompted them to do this
1485526 i will say this i am not a scientist but in my view that was unnecessary
1485527 robinho um jogador espetacular tem um grande talento seria fant stico se ele viesse aqui
1485528 vamos jogar um futebol bonito e empolgar os torcedores com os jogadores que temos podemos praticar um futebol de alto n vel
1485529 com todos os grandes jogadores que o clube tem a adapta o tem sido muito f cil a prepara o est indo bem aproveitei para fazer amizade com meus companheiros e o entrosamento em campo est aparecendo cada vez mais estou muito feliz com minha situa o aqui
1485530 contrary to speculation earlier today the clydesdale bank premier league fixtures this weekend will go ahead as planned
1485531 the ssfra today agreed the figure as the accepted fee structure for spl games for the coming season this allows the season to begin as scheduled on saturday we have further agreed to engage in a benchmarking process with appropriate european leagues
1485532 my job is to support kevin a lot and help him kevin has views that are pretty forthright and right and we have to talk through them we then have to work out how we implement them and make them part of the fabric of the team and that will take place over the coming months
1485533 when we the selectors decided to offer kevin the captaincy the first thing i wanted to do was to sit down and talk to him about where he was coming from and what his views were on where the side should go and would they match with mine
1485534 we talked openly and we were coming from the same place there is lots of work to do to achieve some of those things kevin will need support from me at times and i will need support from him and that is the way the coach player relationship should work by the end of it we felt very confident that we were coming from the same place which was exciting so i drove away and i think kevin was the same quite buoyant and excited over what the future might hold

1485537 i had no idea michael was about to stand down at the weekend
1485538 i did not try to talk him out of it
1485539 i respect the way he went about it the key now for me is to look forward to getting kevin established and moving the team forward it is a different but exciting time
1485540 i think now is the time for a real debate on the future of public sector sports broadcasting
1485541 there are 19 million people who are interested in cricket in this country they buy tv licences and surely they should have a right to expect that public sector broadcasters mount bids for the nations summer sport as they do in the case of one of them for 12 other sports
1485542 if the bbc is to remain part of this it must answer to the millions of cricket fans in england and wales and explain how it prioritises its investment
1485543 the bbc is astonished by the comments from the ecb we always said any bid for live test cricket was subject to value for money and the ability to schedule it in our view neither of these criteria were met
1485544 we have consistently argued that not having cricket as a listed event puts it out of reach of all terrestrial broadcasters it is absurd to blame the bbc for this outcome
1485545 we made it extremely clear that we were prepared to consider anything from terrestrial broadcasters
1485546 thats the first time im hearing that i didnt know that
1485547 i guess im definitely doing the 100 metres as well then
1485548 i thought it was 80 per cent certain id be doubling now i guess its 100 per cent
1485549 this is the first time theres been a miscommunication between us
1485550 i hope it doesnt happen again if he said it then he hasnt exactly communicated it to me
1485551 when i step on the line in beijing dont worry ill be ready to go
1485552 i honestly think bolt can run 9 6 seconds asafa can run 9 6 and a healthy tyson can run 9 6
1485553 four athletes ran faster than 9 90 seconds in 2004 but that might be like sixth place here
1485554 its been a long process to get here and now im finally here i want to come away with a medal whether i can do that is a different story but deep in my heart i want to come away with a medal if i come away without one ill be disappointed
1485555 theres a medal there for us if everything goes well
1485556 heck it would be great to have an olympic medal
1485557 but would it mean more to any golfer than getting his hands on the claret jug or the green jacket
1485558 winning olympic gold would be great for both me and my country
1485559 it would be something always to have with pride but no not as important as winning a slam event for a tennis player that always has to be the supreme achievement
1485560 i am not sure the talent is coming through as fast as it was
1485561 watching the foreign teams and seeing the touch their kids possess and the way they take the ball its a lot different to the way our kids take the ball the england manager has said that hes not got the pool of talent to pick from from 16 or 17 upwards that hed like
1485562 when i was at west ham harry redknapp was putting three or four kids in every year just dipping them in and out of the team would he do that now at portsmouth i dont think he would the risks are too great
1485563 i doubt well get rooney for the start of the season with this virus that hes had
1485564 its 12 days until the start of the season and hes not trained its been a long time
1485565 hes a manchester united player its finished hes here hes going to play here next season its all over
1485566 rafael van der vaart is the first and possibly the only signing of the summer for real madrid
1485567 we believe that this squad is full of quality and plenty of talent its a team which is a great family very close
1485568 weve reached a tipping point in football over respect to referees there were incidents last year that received lots of attention there was a breakdown in referees running games last season
1485569 the cole and and mascherano incidents brought this to our attention in particular but maybe they have done the game a favour
1485570 football engages motivates and inspires but at times we know it can get ugly we all have a responsibility to deal with these excesses and i sense there is a commitment from all quarters of the game including media to deal with it
1485571 we need the leadership of top players their role is absolutely decisive
1485572 if you look at it from public finance weve put 500m into elite sports and what weve got to try and do is make sure theres a recovery of that in terms of the outcomes
1485573 it wasnt a target that we put to uk sport uk sport themselves decided thats what we should expect from the amount of investment thats gone in
1485574 i think people have recognised the amount of investment that has gone into sport over the last 10 years but they will certainly measure that by outcomes and thats why these games will be important because weve handed the opportunity to give the athletes time to train
1485575 we have to move forward we have a well financed and well organised elite system and we have to look at improving i would think it unacceptable if we didnt move forward
1485576 its an amazing olympic village and certainly raises the bar for future organising committees
1485577 we remind them that they are joining a very exclusive club
1485578 since the modern games began only 6 519 people have represented great britain money cant buy a place in it
1485579 if you can bring these young hopefuls here and allow them to become immersed in the games and see what it takes to win medals then i think that will be very helpful for them in the future
1485580 the challenge is to make sure there is more competition between athletes than between chemists laboratories
1485581 they are looking out and pointing their fingers at people who may be doping
1485582 but he is still very much in our plans for the future
1485583 olympiacos is a challenge for me i know i will be here for two years
1485584 ive had two weeks of pre season training with liverpool and i believe i will be ready to do whatever i have to
1485585 i think stephen is a bit disappointed but from our point of view he will certainly push roy carroll stephen has looked very sharp in pre season and i am not disappointed
1485586 oh deary me less than two weeks to go and still no signings instead of the stable progress we all expected we have gone backwards the first team is weaker and no new signings are imminent
1485587 a player who fans backed 100 per cent for 10 years and a player who we all thought was honest and decent has actually turned out to be a worm and snake of the highest order
1485588 can anyone else see koumas going to blackburn to replace bentley
1485589 one small step for marine one giant leap for marinekind
1485590 the feeling is now that environmentalists can smell victory they will keep pushing i have absolutely no doubt some fishermen will flout the ban in due course
1485591 this is a game of confidence and we should all buoyed by what we did here in 2004
1485592 when i drove in it all came flooding back where everything was
1485593 and the course yeah its changed with just the addition of a few new tees but its basically the same you know i played pretty good that week and im playing ok at the moment so i hope to carry that form through
1485594 it is amazing no european has won the uspga since tommy armour 78 years ago
1485595 especially when you consider the strength weve had over the years the likes of faldo seve langer woosie monty
1485596 well if you look at my record when i get on a roll i tend to stay on it for a good while this would be some place to start off the winning
1485597 youve met him thats why we appointed him it was an easy decision we needed someone who would be an inspiration robbie has confidence ambition and determination
1485598 my father was an emigrant from italy who worked in a steel factory my mother worked part time when my father came home she would go out to work cleaning offices it was a great upbringing which taught me to appreciate the value of things
1485599 there was not much money around but my sister and i were happy all the sports facilities were 10 minutes walk from my house and the school system was very good my parents said you can play football but you must finish your studies i did that then i became a professional
1485600 what i did not know i found out very quickly i think i am up to date ive been watching the videos from last year getting to know my players and our opponents
1485601 it is good to see them outside their normal environment
1485602 im not sure if the players enjoy it but it is for their benefit
1485603 it is a long season and think it will benefit them especially in injury prevention
1485604 i said dont worry i trained at harlington chelseas previous training ground shared with imperial college and adjacent to heathrow i said this is better not as windy and you dont get the planes taking off
1485605 i had a great career to go from a small town in switzerland to play for the italian national team was a dream come true so was playing for lazio and chelsea winning trophies when i look back i am very grateful for what i had rather than what i missed
1485606 i remember it very well what happened after at the time you do not feel pain you have the adrenaline in your blood then they gave me morphine that is when i realised why people take drugs i felt absolutely great my leg was hanging off and i was wow this is fantastic but it wears off
1485607 in all i had 10 operations nine within six weeks then one to remove the rod i had in my tibia a year later i still have problems i can do a little bit on the pitch but the day after i feel it and it is not going to get better
1485608 its a tough challenge in a league which not many of our players have experienced with a higher tempo and rhythm but it is an exciting one
1485609 i learnt more from the bad ones one in particular i would watch his work how he treated players how he coached and think i will never do that if i become a manager no i wont tell you who he was
1485610 return to the creative and business helm of a fashion label
1485611 happy to be in the midst of so many asian babes
1485612 like a dress on a beautiful woman long enough to cover the important parts and short enough to keep your interest
1485613 and on a day like saturday with thousands of kids and first time racegoers there wed be letting everyone down if we didnt let the sports greatest public asset take the stage hes ridden here almost all his working life and if anyone can have a foot in either camp he can this is not the olympic games after all its the shergar cup but it says a lot about the progress of the event that hes so keen to ride
1485614 classic disruptive innovation where the mainstream dismisses the product and small companies have time to create a real differentiated value
1485615 this is so stupid a lot of the problem is americans as usual spending more than they have and the dumb banks who let them get away with it i feel sorry for neither
1485616 do you believe in god why youve seen no proof of it you dont have to see proof of a thing to see its results or consequences
1485617 i think the media has to take a lot of blame for all the derogatory remarks written about the economy and this country day in and day out
1485618 please just once in a while write about something pleasant and with good common sense

1485625 at a biker rally in sturgis south dakota john mccain appears to have volunteered his wife for a topless beauty pageant

1485628 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1485629 if we are more aggressive about this in childhood i think we can have an impact on what happens later in life and avoid some of these heart attacks and strokes in adulthood
1485630 one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1485631 please see our campaigns response to senator barack obamas insistence that if americans simply inflated their car tires it would be a more effective solution to americas energy crisis than expanding our domestic oil drilling capability
1485632 we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil that wed get from john mccain drilling
1485633 i said you could inflate your tires to the proper levels and that if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil that wed get from john mccain drilling right below his feet wherever he was actually going to drill
1485634 instead of offering a real plan to lower gas prices the only energy plan that hes really promoting is more drilling
1485635 thats what he talked about yesterday i want to drill here i want to drill now i dont know where he was standing i think he was in a building somewhere
1485636 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1485637 meanwhile the oil companies already own drilling rights to 68 million acres of federal lands onshore and offshore that they havent touched 68 million acres that have the potential to nearly double americas total oil production and john mccain wants to give them more well that might make sense in washington but it doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than right here at yucca mountain
1485638 obama has said no to nuclear power he has said no to domestic supply on all fronts he is happier with higher gas prices

1485781 we re hoping for a grass roots response to this down the road
1485782 for ages afterwards its catchy hahaha it almost has somethinig reminiscent of kellys shoes only a bit less sarky yet phatter and better if you follow my meaning
1485783 we purposely put some of those old school bugs into this game so it does recreate that feel
1485784 in the part with the dragon with the flame there should be flickering and whatnot
1485785 in the options of this game you can adjust flicker unlike the old games
1485786 i would wish for more than that but realistically i think were looking at not much more than 10 percent countywide
1485787 people have already gone to the polls three weeks before and they feel like to come out for just one race is too much trouble
1485788 it costs approximately the same amount of money to pay for a run off election as it does to pay for the first election
1485789 its worth it to the candidate who wants to get elected its worth the turn out even if its a low turn out its worth the cost
1485790 i think i have the game to win a slam
1485791 my results here show i have the potential to do it
1485792 ive started to play more consistently in the bigger tournaments
1485793 and winning my first masters event makes a big difference to my confidence
1485794 in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god
1485795 the word became a human being and lived with us and we saw his shkhinah the shkhinah of the fathers only son full of grace and truth
1485796 bresheet hayah hadavar vhadavar hayah eem haelohim veyelohim hayah hadavar

1485798 in the first four books g d spoke directly to moshe
1485799 it was as if g d was speaking to the jewish nation through the throat of moshe
1485800 in contrast to these four books where the story and or mitzvot are presented in third person the style of sefer devarim is very different for it is written almost entirely in first person the reason for this is quite simple sefer devarim consists of a collection of speeches delivered by moshe rabeinu before his death
1485801 this teaches us that he rebuked them only a short while before his death
1485802 reuben my son i will tell you why i have not reproved you for your shortcomings during all these years so that you would not leave me and join my brother esau
1485803 his message to the jews was dont be afraid sichon and og were tremendous giants who lived at the border of the promised land in their role as protectors of the canaanite kings the source of their strength was the angels who had fathered them they were angels who had protested the creation of man because they were angels they were unable to grasp that man by overcoming his physical nature was in fact stronger than the angels by defeating sichon and og in battle moses showed the jews that one who keeps the torah can overcome the canaanite kings and all they represent as well
1485804 the opening words of moshe in dvarim are a recount of the disappointing events surrounding their 40 years of wandering the people are poised to go into the land but first their past actions warrants a personal rebuke told in first person from moshe hence our connection to the rebuke of the haftarah portion
1485805 if you come in now what will people say that it was you who have caused the flock to be carried off
1485806 your greatness is that you have taken the 600 000 out of bondage but you have buried them in the desert and will bring into the land a different generation this being so people will think that the generation of the desert have no share in the world to come no better be beside them and you shall in the time to come enter with them
1485807 ordinarily we attribute moses and aarons punishment with the sin of striking the rock at meribah num 20 the incident with the spies however predates the sin of moses and aaron at the waters of meribah by 38 years thirty eight years before the crime of striking the rock was committed their sentence was passed a generation before they committed the sin their punishment was announced perhaps the punishment was as much a justification for the sentence that they were already under as it was a punishment for striking the rock such is the fate of the righteous though they do not share in the sin of their generation they often share in its punishment the destiny of moses was sealed with that of the people he led
1485808 if i may not enter it the promised land in my lifetime let me reach it after my death
1485809 in israel none like moshe arose again a prophet who perceived his vision clearly
1485810 in israel arose again a prophet who perceived his vision clearly
1485811 after lamenting the missed opportunity to make dick cheney his own vice president in 2001 mccain will have a chance to choose his very own cheney
1485812 we think its important that the american people have all the facts at their fingertips when it comes to john mccain and his vice presidential pick this site gives reporters voters and activists a chance to review the record and see for themselves that no matter who he picks a mccain ticket means more of the same for families already struggling to pay out of control energy costs keep their jobs and stay in their homes
1485813 we wanted to know when our american friends would get interested in tracking down the terrorists responsible for hundreds of suicide bombings in pakistan and those playing havoc with our natural resources in balochistan while sitting in kabul and delhi

1485816 the government has a strong wish to carry out the expulsion as quickly as possible but this will have to happen within the boundaries of norways international human rights obligations
1485817 to an area where they risk being the victims of torture
1485818 the world for which the national security system was created no longer exists
1485819 national security workforce bound by a national security culture that rewards cooperation and collaboration

1485868 now when you describe a specific procedure that accounts for less than 1 of the abortions that take place then naturally people get concerned and i think legitimately so but the broader issue here is do women have the right to make these profoundly difficult decisions and i trust them to do it
1485869 it would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute

1485877 weve seen this constant stream of data breaches where various kinds of businesses and institutions suffer some kind of data intrusion or lost files the social security number in particular is found to be the most important piece of information for an identity thief
1485878 goes contrary to the whole effort to limit relying on it

1485882 the aggregate amount of sales reported to the irs isnt going to match the individual sellers tax returns

1485978 the wassce test is required by the ncaa eligibility center to show that ehimen completed the core curriculum requirements and minimum grade point average set forth in ncaa bylaws
1485979 it was our hope that by providing his proof of graduation and official transcript that ehimen could receive a waiver and be declared a ncaa division i qualifier however the ncaa eligibility center denied the review of the waiver based upon case precedent ultimately the ncaa must have ehimens wassce score to certify his eligibility
1485980 it is very disappointing not only for ehimen but for wsu
1485981 ehimen and wsu have done everything the ncaa asked us to do however the ncaa now has said the lack of the wassce score is the determining factor
1485982 ehimen is a tremendous student he has a good sat score passed the ged with flying colors and made two as in summer school just the fact that he lacks a test score from november of 2007 makes it tough to swallow we are however continuing to make daily calls to try and obtain the score
1485983 finally take another 10 minutes at a slow pace on the treadmill to gradually cool your body down use this time to feel the warm afterglow and sense of well being that intense exercise provides those endorphins are magic take a moment to associate that positive relaxed yet invigorated feeling with going to the gym and doing your workout for many of us this can shift our psychological focus from dreading a workout and doing it reluctantly to positively looking forward to it and to the sense of well being it delivers
1485984 i love the way i feel when i abstain from weakness i dont want to stay down i will get up and try again and feel those feelings again

1485986 the very fact that you have a book about your restaurant will elevate your brand but it will be a great book because you have so many great stories besides i know the perfect writer
1485987 i grew up next door to the murphy family they were an exotic family to say the least dad ran a cheese business out of the back yard and did a lot of ministering to the poor mom was a nurse and there were lots and lots of kids tom or tommy as we knew him was always my favorite because of that personality he still has today my most vivid memory of him is as a young child standing down by the curb of east wesley road selling hot dogs from a little stand he had cobbled together as you might expect they were good and they sold so maybe murphys is really a lot older than 25
1485988 normally that fire drill trick works so i dont have to give a speech
1485989 in new york if people walk down that many flights of stairs they just go on back to work and the speech never happens it didnt work here
1485990 when the atlanta press club invited me to speak i said no pause i still feel that way
1485991 many great stories about toms excellent restaurant in virginia highland and a quote from me on page 10
1485992 its about time that you let jesus give you your money back
1485993 first and foremost i try to think seasonal and local and then i think southern not every single thing on the menu is southern but i always try to give it some sort of southern twist
1485994 i learned all the cooking techniques from those guys but i always wanted to spin this other thing on it you know
1485995 i finally got the power to do it here so im running with it
1485996 people read the menu and its not like every other menu
1485997 we wanted to be just slightly different showcasing some of the beautiful ingredients that the south has to offer the grains that nobodys ever heard of boiled peanuts its giving people a little piece of my home
1485998 i want to make some more connections with local farmers and maybe give them some ideas of things id like to see grown or grown specifically for me
1485999 nobody wants to sell a green tomato here because they can get more money when its nice and red and plump and juicy
1486000 im really proud of boston sports my family back home are all on the team stats bandwagon theyre all pulling for the sox
1486001 but im not fully converted new england is great but the south is in my blood
1486002 i wasnt happy about it but ill give them everything they want and i wont have to deal with it anymore
1486003 were just waiting for the wilbur to get their permits set before the license is given out which is standard practice
1486004 you name a big time comedy act nine out of 10 theyll be there
1486005 youll see stuff in the next few weeks its really going to be an exciting place
1486006 i think that cee lo makes me stretch a little bit and go places i wouldnt go and be comfortable with and i think i might do the same for him we try to do something that maybe hasnt been done but not outside of who we are either neither one of us is good actors so i dont think that would really work
1486007 on this third album we feel like maybe we could try something a little bit different
1486008 but its hard because we dont work very deliberately we dont really talk so much about musically what stuff is going to sound like we just do it
1486009 i think that where we are right now as a group is a lot closer to what we really expected when we were setting out to do this
1486010 we didnt think we were making music that a ton of people would get we figured it was maybe melodic enough that it wouldnt be completely underground but not necessarily as big
1486011 we dont go in looking to do something thats going to get easily swallowed by everybody that doesnt mean something like crazy cant come out of it but its definitely not what we set out to do its a lot more personal for both of us
1486012 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1486013 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1486014 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1486015 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1486016 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed
1486017 thats not giving him mccain a pass on it i think his campaign does have an obligation to figure out what happened and to make sure it doesnt happen again
1486018 what we talk about when we talk about you how agents amp editors negotiate and collaborate
1486019 tell me again why other people have to see this i really think its unnecessary me ow
1486020 i spent almost a year looking for the right opportunity then i found out about sfi my search was over sfi had everything i was looking for quality products training a support system and a genuine opportunity thanks to sfi i have achieved one of my major life goals to own my own business

1486028 there is no justification whatsoever for having these weapons i would suggest that a minority of people had hidden them with the intention of causing harm to police officers and possibly to the horses or dogs that we are using on patrol and if you look at the equipment we have seized it is clear the plan was to use these items for criminal purposes
1486029 these claims made by police are ridiculous were eating food at the camp what do the police think we are cutting up our potatoes with one wonders if assistant chief constable gary beautridge will be raiding his own kitchen
1486030 yesterday we were disappointed with the police now we are disgusted
1486031 we have seen a really high level of political policing they are confiscating things we need to use on the camp such as wood for the toilets and pipes for running water its ridiculous you name it the boys in blue have taken it from us its a blatant campaign they have been using to put people off coming here because there is reluctance among the authorities to allow us to have a real discussion on climate change

1486039 it is important to know and trust the source of your seed
1486040 buying certified seed is the best way to know what you re getting
1486041 it s just not possible for a red wheat to revert to being a white wheat in the field
1486042 it doesn t matter if you re growing red wheat or white wheat
1486043 i may start another publication i may start an ad agency or maybe ill move to the coast and write a book

1486045 i would tell them the most important thing is to work on your self esteem that is the best advice i can give
1486046 i suppose i am who i am and you am who you am too
1486047 if not now when its only going to get worse as will the pain

1486049 as far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever prosecuted in this country
1486050 to bring about positive civic change through forceful editorial writing and serving as an insightful authoritative source inside and outside the newsroom for developments that impact
1486051 exemplary devotion to producing a newspaper that sincerely cares about its community
1486052 steadfast support for the peoples right to know and the first amendment in both the newsroom and the front office and exemplary outreach efforts to connect the globe to the broad and diverse community it serves
1486053 it is clear he had arranged for a readily exchangable currency
1486054 he used not only trickery but violence to achieve his ends
1486055 we dont know his real name we dont know when he was born we do not know where he went to high school we cannot even verify he is a u s citizen
1486056 this pattern of deliberately covering up who he is persists to this arraignment
1486057 when youre among friends you can really capitalize on preexisting protocols
1486058 and then later get very tight and inbred with everybody talking to everybody
1486059 there is basic development in the semantic web in city university to develop tools and ontologies but what we are doing is looking at the semantic webs potential for knowledge construction
1486060 our vision is that the semantic web and teaching and learning in the 21st century is about more than knowledge transmission but making sense of vast amounts of information and it is more than enhanced search but using tools to create new knowledge
1486061 dazzling the public with tales of how madman ivins at his detrick army lab produced anthrax spores with a dna profile that pinpoints him as the lone culprit
1486062 then did ivins also write the notes that were in the anthrax laden letters to senator pat leahy and broadcaster tom brokow the ones which ended with death to america death to israel allah is great
1486063 and what about those anthrax letters being sent out to democratic senators on the eve of the vote on the patriot act was that mere coincidence or was ivins out to stampede congress into passing that bill
1486064 but the times is reporting that ivins therapist says he was a sociopathic homicidal killer who planned to kill his co workers because he was about to be indicted on capital murder charges
1486065 maybe he did go beserk when he found out that the feds were after him
1486066 mcdonalds was in the process of installing wide screen tvs in all of their restaurants over the entire five state region and that the fox news only policy was corporate policy for all mcdonalds restaurants in the region the director also stated that the reason for this policy was that mcdonalds had determined that there is less violence on fox news than any other channel
1486067 for your information it is no secret that fox is a right wing political propaganda machine that is now and has been for years actively campaigning for the republican party and against the democratic party it is the baddest of the bad things this political activity on the part of mcdonalds is entirely unacceptable although it would certainly be normal in the former ussr and present day china and other totalitarian countries as a lawyer and citizen who is very concerned about political propaganda being used directly and subliminally by a political party or its outlets including apparently mcdonalds i am outraged at this report please either confirm or deny that it is true if it is its certainly a firm basis for a nationwide indeed worldwide consumer boycott of your company i await your reply
1486068 its like im complaining about a worm in a hamburger
1486069 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
1486070 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
1486071 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning
1486072 i think that the matrixsynth blog is great and keeps people well in touch with everything synth i visit everyday to see whats going on
1486073 first person narratives of obsessed half demented men going on and on and on and on

1486076 because fundamentally he had scant concern for human beings it was events that interested him things happening not those involved

1486081 i started calling around and got the assistant attorney general to let me inside a lot of the case as long as i didnt write anything until the trial was over
1486082 weve used canon lenses through the years and of all of the lens manufacturers canon is the most attentive to our needs
1486083 at a large show its not uncommon to see a representative from canon its nice to see vendors taking an interest
1486084 canon places great importance on its relationships with each and every user of its hd field studio portable and cine style lenses
1486085 the reliability of these products is now well proven and such features as canons highly refined shift is image stabilizer technology and our new auto focus technology combine to ensure consistency of razor sharp hd imagery throughout the coverage of any sports event
1486086 there are some great benefits to canons shift is image stabilizer
1486087 when youre in a stadium and everyones jumping it can cause the camera to shake turning the image stabilization on makes a dramatic improvement in hd image quality when the operator begins to pan it optimizes the use of image stabilization by interfacing with the vinten vector 950 active pan tilt head system this removes lag after fast pan or tilt shots which is great for sports canon is adding this capability to our existing 100x lenses on our platinum truck so that every canon lens we own will be capable of interfacing to vector 950 active heads thats great manufacturer support
1486088 another big plus with the digisuper100s is canons servo crank style control
1486089 some camera operators tend to prefer old fashioned crank style zoom controls but installing this requires exchanging modules in the lens now however canon has a new servo controller that simulates the old manual crank you dont have to unhook anything from the lens you just exchange the thumb grip zoom controller with canons new crank style servo controller we purchased a set of those with each of our new box lenses camera operators like having both options especially in baseball and golf
1486090 were currently finishing the build on our new truck iridium which will make its debut in july
1486091 its our first truck with all canon lenses and the company has certainly earned the business

1486116 what better way to mark our 20th anniversary than to celebrate filipino talent no
1486117 we have had several meetings already thinking of how to celebrate differently and then we hit on this idea
1486118 i never imagined i would be standing side by side with these big stars
1486119 comments are moderated and will not appear on this weblog until the author has approved them
1486120 i want to look you in the eye i will not raise taxes
1486121 heres an alarming statistic its estimated that in every square yard meter of soil there are probably 100 000 seeds this is why regular weeding is inescapable
1486122 we have increased our forecast because there has already been a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic have developed
1486123 its not plausible its not credible and theres nothing to support it
1486124 what a mockery that after five years in detention aafia is suddenly discovered in afghanistan
1486125 aafia was tortured for five years until one day us authorities announce that they have found her in afghanistan which shows how they abused their power and tortured an innocent woman without committing any crime
1486126 documents describing the creation of explosives as well as excerpts from the anarchists arsenal
1486127 siddiquis papers included descriptions of various landmarks in the united states including in new york city
1486128 may the blood of unintelligible be directly on your unintelligible possibly head or hands
1486129 despite being shot siddiqui struggled with the officers when they tried to subdue her she struck and kicked them while shouting in english that she wanted to kill americans
1486130 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1486131 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1486132 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1486133 they clearly requested that the interahamwes continue to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1486134 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1486135 the game was there to be won we had opportunities not very many obviously but we never managed to take them
1486136 we gave away needless free kicks and corners which was always going to be a major problem in the game
1486137 we just didnt do well enough overall and i dont think we showed we were comfortable at any stage of the game
1486138 it seems fairly ridiculous that you can reach a european and then get knocked out at the first game of the next season but thats the way it has happened
1486139 were pleased to see the investment doubleclick has made to enable customers such as nbcolympics com to take advantage of silverlight to offer compelling packages to their advertisers
1486140 microsoft has always had a strong commitment to working closely with partners and the industry to enable them to leverage our tools and platform to deliver great user experiences
1486141 with hundreds of advertisers multiple platforms and large site traffic spikes we needed to work with a partner that could provide an integrated scalable robust solution
1486142 by expanding doubleclick to work with silverlight 2 we can make it possible for clients to create unique entertainment and advertising experiences without increasing their workload or creating new complex processes said google product manager ari paparo
1486143 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
1486144 they want to turn the year 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1486145 for these two people it is very clear that they are part of violent terrorist forces
1486146 we stay in our bedrooms and the dining rooms not in the open
1486147 im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1486148 all decisions and orders of the international court of justice must be respected by states
1486149 the united states should take every step to make sure the execution does not take place
1486150 should texas execute mr medellin before congress has a reasonable opportunity to convert the icj judgment into a justifiable federal right the state of texas will forever deprive mr medellin of his constitutionally protected right not to be deprived of his life without a due process of law
1486151 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1486152 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jos medellins execution goes forward
1486153 realmente valgo en la cancha seg n afirm al ser presentado el martes por su nuevo club

1486158 web 2 0 sites is the ability to own more then one result in the top 10 of google with your content
1486159 they manchester united have had two good years and you have to stand back and take your hat off to them but we know we were good last year and we have another level to go to
1486160 last year i think we saw the very best of man united but we have got an awful lot to come from last year
1486161 argentina are the group favourites but the other teams are all capable of beating each other
1486162 thats why i think that whoever wins this thursday will have a great chance of making it through the group we have to take this opportunity
1486163 its true that weve not been able to make the podium as yet but its also true that people see us differently since the world cup in germany were hoping to be able to rise to the challenge
1486164 the lads have been on tour for the last couple of weeks and theyve got used to playing in this heat
1486165 my case is a bit different though because i only joined up with the squad last week anyway well have to adapt our game to suit these conditions
1486166 being part of an olympic games doesnt happen every day and you have to make the most of it for me personally id love to attend the swimming events though i wont be able to for obvious reasons
1486167 i dont remember much about that game from four years ago
1486168 but the current team is physically very strong and well have to be very focused and play our best football to win well have our strongest possible line up available out on the pitch and that should make a difference
1486169 you want how much 3 for that why i can get the same thing around the corner for 2
1486170 when either chooses not to trade theres no harm done
1486171 i have a 2 bill but i really only value it at 1 and would be indifferent to someone coming along and taking it for a buck
1486172 knowing how to put out the fire when the bacon fat overflows the skillet
1486173 i guess youve waived the right to challenge it by not challenging it sooner
1486174 you should not punish the generals driver today with the crimes of the general
1486175 history and world opinion will judge whether the government proved the system to be fair
1486176 say there will be a response but that clarification is needed on certain points of the offer
1486177 theyve hit the ball back we must analyse whether its just another way to gain time or if its serious
1486178 the message delivered today is not irans response to the six countries
1486179 if we are not going to receive a clear response a clear message from them we are going to have no choice but to pursue additional measures
1486180 given the equipment our armed forces have an indefinite blockade of the strait of hormuz would be very easy
1486181 they have a very weak economy at this point which depends almost entirely on their oil revenue
1486182 you need to know whether f x is a function call or a list of names do you not
1486183 in cond f x f x is neither quoted nor is it a function call
1486184 gay couples cant have biological kids together so if homosexuality is genetic why hasnt it died out
1486185 todos nos estamos volviendo m s pesados y es una responsabilidad global
1486186 theres about 3 000 worth of presents on our list bought for us by family and friends and we have received none of it
1486187 there was everything from vases to rugs to coffee makers these are the sort of things we will spend the rest of our lives using and would have provided memories of who was at our wedding now we will have to ask all of our guests to get their money back set up another list and go through it all again
1486188 by the time you have spent 700 on a hen weekend to barcelona and 500 on going to the wedding the last thing you feel like doing is buying them a gift especially when they present you with a list from the conran shop and everything costs more than 100
1486189 i remember a few years ago people were wondering if it was polite to send guests a wedding list but thats all gone now
1486190 now guests expect to buy something from a list the other change we have noticed is that people are getting married later in life and already have a toaster so now they are asking for things such as flatscreen tvs and ipods its now becoming increasingly common to ask for money perhaps to contribute to the honeymoon or to pay for a new kitchen
1486191 i dont know if they got it but the one that sticks in my head was the couple who asked for a hamster and someone bought them one
1486192 i was at a wedding where there had been two lists one was at john lewis the other at argos
1486193 as we came into the church rather than asking people if they were on the bride or grooms side the ushers were asking john lewis argos and directing people to opposite sides of the church
1486194 in the current economic climate it allows people to get married who might otherwise put it off because they cant afford it
1486195 you could say that but then traditional gift lists are becoming more mercenary it depends how you look at it i think this is a very personal gift because you are helping a couple avoid starting their married life in debt
1486196 no because people dont feel they can go to a wedding empty handed so they will usually always buy something and it alleviates stress for a lot of people
1486197 so we didnt need things like new cutlery but we did want nicer glassware things like a coffee maker and better bed linen weve been trying to keep it practical but we did put a cross trainer on kind of not seriously and somebody has already bought us that
1486198 it is usual that travellers forget their luggage but not a child
1486199 every man i have ever been involved with has been violent to me
1486200 many vulnerable women escaping domestic violence lie low and stay away from councils altogether so are not counted
1486201 raped beaten and burned just because i had nowhere to go and wouldnt do what someone wanted me to homeless women are especially bullied
1486202 for the first couple of days everyone is so nice to you the next thing you know someones stolen your stuff you might get kicked to death at night sleeping rough but in a hostel you can get any number of diseases with all the germs theyre very unhygienic
1486203 women are still much more of a sexual object on the streets than men sure there are young boys begging and prostituting themselves they go into the public toilets and its never ever talked about but sadly its all about drugs the whole issue around everything on the streets today is about drugs
1486204 but she doesnt have the experience to get around it she begs then hands the money over to him and theyre off to score if she doesnt get off the gear theres no way shell escape him you see a lot of this kind of thing
1486205 they stored my possessions and offered me a place to shower most days
1486206 if you are a woman one of the worst experiences of being homeless is when your period comes the lack of hygiene and the humiliation is hard to describe simple things are suddenly so complicated you have to go and find some place to clean up and its not always easy a man does not have these problems
1486207 it was my passport and the few coins that i had in that bag a bus driver along with two other people ran to help me he punched my attacker until he ran away
1486208 like most crops truffles need water and warmth and thats what weve had this summer there are lots of truffles and we have found them up to 500g each bigger than cricket balls
1486209 we had a look at some three weeks ago but they werent right they had grown slowly because of the spring cold however since then we have had lots of rain which has helped them grow and it has also been humid so they are doing very well
1486210 they have got a couple of really old trees in the garden and we were just clearing out this wooded area when i came across this truffle it was about 7cm long as we carried on working we found about nine to 10 truffles
1486211 i would think there would be more in the garden and there are some more beech trees in neighbouring gardens i think it would be worth looking
1486212 it would take you a day to find a kilo of truffles in france
1486213 the key is we dont dig the truffles out we wait until they come to the surface and we only pick 30 or 40 of what is there
1486214 you can buy eco fabrics yourself like organic cotton from hemp fabric uk you can buy natural dyes from companies such as fibrecrafts who offer detailed instructions on how to use pure colours such as turmeric and indigo
1486215 there was no repeat of the suggestion that the downside risks to growth appear to have diminished somewhat
1486216 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1486217 the fed like a soldier under fire remains hunkered down in its foxhole for the time being
1486218 committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year
1486219 a pox on your firstborn a pox on your firstborn a pox on your firstborn
1486220 well this is what i am and this is what i will be for the rest of my life
1486221 consumer spending makes up 70 percent of gross domestic product and when one group accounts for a very substantial share of consumer spending they also account for a large share of the economic activity that creates jobs
1486222 a lot of our clients stop by a deli on the way to the airport rather than have a catered meal on the plane
1486223 people are examining do you keep the yacht do you go to the classic car auction do you take the private jet those sound like nice problems to have but at the same time they are issues

1486229 i live in the real world why do i want to read about it i want to read about things that arent in my world
1486230 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1486231 nuclear power alone is not enough drilling alone is not enough we need to do all this and more
1486232 john mccain has taken a page out of the bush cheney playbook
1486233 hes offered a plan with no significant investments in alternative energy
1486234 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1486235 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1486236 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1486237 this plan will not lower prices today it will not lower prices during the next administration the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least the next seven years
1486238 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1486239 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america he also says no to nuclear storage and reprocessing i couldnt disagree more
1486240 i have proposed a plan to build additional nuclear plants that means new jobs and that means new energy
1486241 galveston is open for business and we certainly welcome the tourists back to the island
1486242 texas is grateful that this storm did not escalate to hurricane strength before making landfall on our shores
1486243 youll see some green up ideally if you get enough rain you can sustain a good bit of growth and maybe get some hay out of it
1486244 it is chaos but we are managing it and having a wonderful time
1486245 shiloh calls them her babies she and z pick out their clothes and help change and hold them its sweet they are little mommies
1486246 has a broken arm broken elbow and minor shoulder damage but is in good spirits
1486247 his schedule for next week has not even been set up
1486248 the north koreans have 11 000 artillery tubes and rockets aimed at the south korean capital so any little thing that we do with north korea makes the south koreans very jittery
1486249 on the other hand the u s has to worry a great deal about where terrorists might get nuclear weapons or nuclear material
1486250 the more ive seen the more critical i see the need is for the world to pay attention to the people of burma and for the world to put pressure on the military regime
1486251 i think its best for u s chinas relations that i go i know its important for me to send a clear signal to the chinese people that we respect them
1486252 he will have to say something public which is always tricky how much he spotlights these issues
1486253 and i think he will not do it in an adversarial way
1486254 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee
1486255 i think by the time we get to the end of this year or early next year the inflation numbers will look a lot less threatening and i dont think the growth environment will be significantly improved
1486256 i found this to be a poorly disguised compromise between those who believe inflation pressures are coming down and inflation hawks who fear the fed is already behind the curve
1486257 the fed should be in a holding pattern for the next five months
1486258 morgan is doing well after his surgery to reconnect nerves and repair damage in his left arm and hand
1486259 the surgery lasted four and a half hours hes visiting with family this morning as of this morning hes up and walking around and looking forward to his release in a few days
1486260 the time frame is that the benefit if there is any from screening is 10 years
1486261 the average life expectancy for men over 75 years is less than 10 years so screening them can do more harm than good
1486262 ich wei nicht wo das k nstliche aufh rt und das wirkliche beginnt
1486263 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1486264 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1486265 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1486266 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1486267 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1486268 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1486269 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaeda connections that went beyond the evidence
1486270 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1486271 that 600 million is kind of one for the ages its held for 10 years
1486272 its very very difficult to get from 500 million to 600 million but the fact were even talking about it tells you something about the strength of the dark knight and what a phenomenon it is
1486273 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting family members this morning
1486274 he was walking this a m and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible
1486275 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1486276 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1486277 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1486278 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1486279 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1486280 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1486281 has a legal and moral obligation to make official statements first to the victims and their families then the public
1486282 and thats the order in which were going to do it
1486283 while we are relieved that none of our members or chapters were at risk we grieve for the victims of the anthrax attacks and their families and on behalf of our members express our sympathy to all who have been personally touched by these tragic events
1486284 the packers will release you over ted thompsons dead body theyre not going to give you the chance to run through the tunnel opening night as a viking
1486285 its a shame when we have all these economic problems that the same people who cant afford to pay for their homes are willing to dash to the newsstands and feed the frenzy that causes magazine editors to spend millions
1486286 its a reflection of the appetite for seeing the children of celebs and also our big interest in judging other mothers
1486287 we are delighted that all proceeds from these stunning images will once again be donated entirely to charity through the jolie pitt foundation
1486288 its either the biggest photo victory ever or the biggest black eye on the journalism business you could imagine
1486289 i used to say its a gamble but now i think its a sure bet they will make it all back maybe not in a specific issue but in free publicity and promotion from the articles even negative ones that will be written about them
1486290 anyone who thinks that will stop the stalkerazzi theyre wrong it didnt work in the old days and it doesnt work now no matter how much money is out there
1486291 in our business there are almost no rules so the fact that the stars are turning the business on its head is probably a natural progression
1486292 the women who read our blog especially the new mothers they feel a connection to these celebrities as if they were family members so theres a natural inclination to want to see the baby pictures of someone you care about
1486293 if a practice is wrong it doesnt matter what the consequences are
1486294 sharing baby photos with family and friends is one thing but having these images put on magazines and on the internet forever is a different story
1486295 i was waiting at the aspen booth at comic con getting a sketch done by current legion artist francis manapul when geoff johns came over and interrupted to talk to him for a second
1486296 combine that with the vague question that johns asked at one panel does anyone miss bart allen and there has to be something there

1486308 this is an important piece of the puzzle as we attempt to determine whether habitable conditions exist for microbes on mars
1486309 in itself it is neither good nor bad for life
1486310 this desert is a hyper arid environment that rarely sees rain and has no vascular plants and is often used by scientists as a matter of fact as a martian analog site
1486311 these compounds are quite stable in soil and water and do not destroy organic materials under normal circumstances in fact there are species of perchlorate producing microbes that live on the energy provided by this oxidant
1486312 unfortunately there was a story out that we were hiding something and of course as soon as that story goes out people speculate the speculation leads to all kinds of wonderful stories of discoveries that i wish wed made but we havent
1486313 how am i supposed to act should i go over to the merch table is that cool
1486314 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1486315 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1486316 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1486317 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers
1486318 i suspect that a lot of people are unaware that their identifying information has been compromised
1486319 there is no senator more liberal than bayh in any state more conservative than indiana
1486320 yes my views have evolved in response to events yours probably have too the question is why have john mccains views evolved in the opposite direction
1486321 its true that he sided with republicans on tort reform partial birth abortion and a flag burning amendment but do democrats really want to be the kind of party that makes litmus tests out of those issues
1486322 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone

1486335 we know they are out there but the problem is how to detect them and determine what they look like it gives us a glimpse of new worlds
1486336 unfortunately l functions are rather like fundamental particles in physics in the sense that they are very important to the universe in which they exist but hard to relate directly to everyday experience
1486337 being able to explore this new l function gives me the excitement that a biologist must feel when discovering a new mammal the techniques developed by bian and booker open up whole new possibilities for experimenting with these powerful and mysterious functions
1486338 its a big step towards our understanding the world of l which is where most of the secrets of number theory are kept

1486340 ohioans are hard workers and we all know that they are the backbone of this states economy and they demand what is right and they demand what is fair
1486341 every day thousands of middle class ohioans face a gut wrenching choice take care of their sick child or spouse or lose their paycheck or their job
1486342 i think job creation is the number one priority of the state of ohio i know we can create stable jobs permanent jobs honest jobs
1486343 this issue has the potential to be the single largest job killer our state has seen in decades
1486344 the ohio constitution was not designed to be a tool for private companies to set up exclusive monopolies and drag money out of ohio
1486345 would sleep probably 15 hours a day he was just worn out he didnt have any energy he asked to go to bed at seven in the evening he was so exhausted
1486346 the day before the diet he had 35 seizures the second day he had ten and then basically his seizures have been cut by about 90 percent
1486347 stabilizes the membranes and the nerve cells making them less excitable less likely to generate seizures we know it changes the chemical balance in the brain also tending to make the brain less excitable and less able to generate seizures
1486348 we thought we had lost him i mean he was not walking well his talking his functioning was just not him and that can happen with this type of epilepsy
1486349 its worth it its every bit of weighing and all the time it takes its so worth it cause we have our boy back
1486350 hopefully well have most of the underground work done tonight and then tomorrow well be doing street repairs
1486351 this year will be equally as hard on those of us who end up being on the wrong side of the street
1486352 just an aggressive campaign against citizens and it was unnecessary to be so harsh
1486353 it wasnt so much an issue with the ordinance it was an issue with how we enforced it in the past
1486354 we have stretches where it really isnt necessary to be doing it because the streets have been cleaned
1486355 if we dont have snow until late november december even january the city administrator will have the authority to not start the alternate side parking for the season
1486356 today we will experiment with a gt new form called the tandem story the process is simple each person gt will pair off with the person sitting to his or her immediate right gt gt as homework tonight one of you will write the first paragraph of a gt short story you will e mail your partner that paragraph and send gt another copy to me the partner will read the first paragraph and then gt add another paragraph to the story and send it back also sending gt another copy to me the first person will then add a third paragraph gt and so on back and forth gt gt remember to re read what has been written each time in order to keep the gt story coherent there is to be absolutely no talking outside of the gt e mails and anything you wish to say must be written in the e mail the gt story is over when both agree a conclusion has been reached
1486357 polar gt orbit established no sign of resistance so far
1486358 why must one gt lose ones innocence to become a woman
1486359 they dont like us florida guys because we fight back when we get picked on
1486360 a couple of years ago we had problems with the sheriff so we sued them and settled out of court for an undisclosed sum
1486361 the guys lawyer came back and took witness statements when the statements made it back to the sheriffs department they came by and asked me why i was getting involved
1486362 they would lie and wait for them to leave and then pull them over to see if they had been drinking
1486363 her husband who does drink was sitting in the passengers seat
1486364 i said i aint giving him the phone this guy is crazier than shit
1486365 i threw the phone back to my daughter and told her to keep taking photos
1486366 he started trying to get in my hummer and get to the back seat where my kids were i told him you better not go back there or else were going to have some real problems
1486367 he said to me what did you do to piss startling off hes really got something against you
1486368 i said to him you ever hear of the first amendment
1486369 he then turned to me and said im charging you with disorderly conduct
1486370 escorted defendant to the middle of the street and told him to cross to the sidewalk defendant for the fourth time refused the verbal commands and thats why he was arrested
1486371 they were accomplices in the criminal enterprise to partially exterminate the bosniak people from srebrenica
1486372 radovan karadzic is at last on his way to the hague but the division of bosnia that was his dream is now more likely than at any time since he became a fugitive
1486373 brussels must resist attempts to undermine the bosnian state insist on constitutional reform to make bosnia more functional and tackle corruption which is becoming ever more embedded
1486374 will be to support the bosnian state and give no succour to those who seek to undermine it
1486375 i hope the party in question will evaluate this outcome very well and get the message it should get
1486376 should take energetic measures to eliminate this phenomenon and ensure that authors of such acts of discrimination on the basis of religion are adequately deterred and sanctioned
1486377 should ensure that those responsible are prosecuted and punished in accordance with the gravity of the crime
1486378 should take measures to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies so that they do not have to resort to illegal or unsafe abortions
1486379 that the vast majority of irelands primary schools are privately run denominational schools
1486380 thus depriving many parents and children who so wish to have access to secular primary education
1486381 we were looking for a faith that offered the reassurance of freedom
1486382 they abducted six children killed six men in my family and stole cattle
1486383 we havent seen those children since it was a very sad day
1486384 but i am too afraid to bring back my children until we make peace with the murle
1486385 most of the villages are deserted simply because they are afraid of the raids
1486386 they move to where the government is where they can be rescued quickly
1486387 when they hear that they are being returned to jonglei they say what happened with the militias and the raids
1486388 they have a political reason to bring all the people back home
1486389 you get one family with five rifles they can make their own platoon
1486390 in jonglei it has not started to the best of our expectations
1486391 the reality of the matter is that there is still a lot of insecurity in most parts of the south
1486392 the truck drivers they have to go all the way around and theyre complaining a lot because its wasting all their gas and its causing cutting out on their time to get the deliveries done
1486393 the roads that theyre planning to us there are a lot of children on those back ways and there are concerns for the safety of the children
1486394 i wonder why they couldnt put up a temporary bridge only a couple 100 feet away
1486395 its still ways out of the way because the couple of ways that i know to get around town its still probably 10 miles
1486396 even just to get to the dollar store theyll have to take a 15 minute drive all the way up just to get there so its going to be difficult but i understand the work that needs to be done
1486397 there is no doubt as to whether the current administration committed war crimes
1486398 well come here and get movies ya know we really dont have a lot of money anymore because prices on everything are going up
1486399 one they want the library card in order to access our computers to search for jobs and type resumes and two to borrow s from the library instead of renting them from a retail store
1486400 theyre faster theyre state of the art earlier this year we installed a new printer for printing content from the web as well as printing professional resumes
1486401 everything is so expensive so we just come here its cheaper
1486402 like everybody else would love to be able to support my family and send my kids to college id like to do it at a job i like to do
1486403 you want us to sit here for two hours while he spurts blood
1486404 turn off that blasted goblinbox and come to bed this very instant
1486405 reflection of the biases and prejudices of a right wing think tank not the views of muslim students across britain
1486406 undermines cohesion and the joint efforts of students institutions and government in tackling violent extremism
1486407 some may interpret this as acts of self defence others may consider this to be akin to the attacks we witnessed on 9 11 or 7 7 i can categorically state that the student muslim population would find it reprehensible to consider acts such as 7 7 and 9 11 as killing in the name of religion this has been stated on a number of occasions and was also highlighted in a survey carried out by fosis following the 7 7 attacks the muslim community as a whole has condemned these atrocities outright and are in no way shape or form to be considered killing in the name of religion
1486408 thus reaffirming the point that the respondents were referring to an act of self defense as opposed to indiscriminate killing of civilians
1486409 contradict british values or more importantly the british legal system
1486410 so the fact that 40 percent of muslim students would welcome elements of the shariah being introduced should neither be alarming nor misunderstood
1486411 on the topic of islam and muslims and very few escape their wrath
1486412 they have a neocon agenda and their director douglas murray indeed wrote a book entitled neoconservatism why we need it he told the pim fortuyn memorial conference in 2006 conditions for muslims in europe must be made harder across the board
1486413 have gone on to become doctors business people and public servants and all have been part of making britain the vibrant society that it is today
1486414 the study could have cited for example those islamic societies that worked in partnership with those jewish student societies to bring about greater understanding
1486415 muslim students do not back killings they are not separatist they are british and very much part of our vibrant society
1486416 we feel this report is irresponsible in its attempt to scaremonger and vilify the islamic societies isocs and contributes to the perpetuation of a climate of islamophobia which unfortunately is increasing at an alarming rate on campus as such the report becomes yet one more way in which muslim students are alienated and seen as the problem rather than empowered to be agents for positive change
1486417 this is yet another damning attack on the muslim community by elements within the academic arena whose only purpose seems to be the undermining of sincere efforts by mainstream muslim organisations to tackle the threat of terror which wider society faces the report is methodologically weak it is unrepresentative and above all serves only to undermine the positive work carried out by islamic societies across the country

1486422 why do jay and julia give so much of themselves to us what have we done to deserve them ah it just drives me crazy we just arent worthy
1486423 after mcpa was informed of the incident a complaint was immediately lodged with pkrs information bureau but as of time of writing there has been no response
1486424 mcpa deeply regrets that pkrs top leadership has failed to look into their shortcomings and allowed similar acts of violence to be perpetuated this is highly unprofessional
1486425 we will try our best in avoiding such incidences in the future
1486426 we call for a thorough police investigation into this matter so that the offenders will be punished and justice be given to the victim as soon as possible
1486427 we note that this not the first incident of physical violence towards the media personnel by pkr supporters
1486428 the same journalist in her blog has written regarding an incident in july 2008 where she was nearly shoved off the stage by an unruly pkr supporter
1486429 we have to win their hearts by using the personal touch and attract them to join us in our by election campaign
1486430 these youths are easily influenced by news in cyberspace and most of them are blog readers we must not discount them as they make up about 25 of the total voters in the permatang pauh constituency
1486431 they will tell us one thing when we meet them and vote the opposition when the day comes
1486432 there are no two ways about it this will be barisans fourth attempt to wrest the seat from pkr since 1999 and i believe it will be a 50 50 fight in the coming by election
1486433 passenger ridership on the kelana jaya line is very strong with large numbers travelling during peak hours the volume of passengers at stations is overwhelming during peak periods
1486434 those interested in conservation and who wish to help please come forward and help us restore these buildings to their former glory
1486435 they can contact the penang municipal council which has a list of addresses and photographs
1486436 for most of them the problem is money and there are some owners living overseas
1486437 however owners of about 200 houses most of them agencies have already begun conservation works
1486438 based on current and projected climate signals atlantic basin and u s landfalling tropical cyclone activity are forecast to be about 90 percent above the 1950 2007 norm in 2008
1486439 there is a high about 95 percent certainty that activity will be in the top one third historically
1486440 tsr anticipates the trade wind predictor having a strong enhancing effect on activity and the sea surface temperature having a small enhancing effect
1486441 due to a combination of a very active early tropical cyclone season in the deep tropics and more favorable hurricane enhancing sea surface temperature and sea level pressure patterns in the tropical atlantic
1486442 the primary concern with our current very active seasonal forecast numbers is the continued ocean surface warming in the eastern and central tropical pacific
1486443 although it seems unlikely at this point there is a possibility that an el ni o could develop this fall
1486444 its not unusual at all to have one or two storms in june and a couple of storms in july if were in an above average season its not unusual at all
1486445 its a misconception to think that were going to have an above average season but were still not going to have them storms until the middle of august
1486446 once hurricane season begins we can have a storm just about any time
1486447 the global warming arguments have been given much attention by many media references to recent papers claiming to show such a linkage
1486448 despite the global warming of the sea surface that has taken place over the last three decades the global numbers of hurricanes and their intensity have not shown increases in recent years except for the atlantic
1486449 each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override for this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others
1486450 the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the one
1486451 the familiar liberal freedoms of conscience association expression and the like
1486452 the welfare of society only depends on the welfare of the worst off individual society is better off if you improve the welfare of others
1486453 a chain is only as strong as its weakest link
1486454 free men by a social contract establish political community i e civil society in which each gain civil rights in return for subjecting to civil law or to political authority a government
1486455 property precedes government and government cannot dispose of the estates of the subjects arbitrarily

1486459 we found tremendous talent and tremendous potential among young people in that neighborhood
1486460 i got kids who gave me wikipedia articles printed out
1486461 they didnt make any effort to conceal the fact that it was a wikipedia article its not like they were plagiarizing and trying to hide it they just thought that was how you did a report

1486491 la reuni n celebrada en el casino de la laguna por un grupo minoritario de compa eros del partido no fue una reuni n casual en mi opini n se trata de una reacci n una aut ntica respuesta ante al manifiesto que en apoyo de l pez aguilar firmamos much simos militantes del psoe en tenerife
1486492 me parece muy bien que se re nan y que por fin sepamos qui nes son es bueno que digan cu l es su opci n de cara al pr ximo congreso regional que se celebrar en el mes de noviembre es muy normal que todos nos posicionemos y pongamos las cartas boca arriba el mismo l pez aguilar ha dicho claramente que todo aquel que desee presentarse a la secretar a regional puede hacerlo libremente es bueno que lo haga yo digo adem s que no se exigen muchos requisitos para poder presentarse antes m s o menos sospech bamos qui nes formaban parte de ese grupo ahora tras la comida de la laguna ya los conocemos con cierta claridad
1486493 en realidad yo no veo alternativa a l pez aguilar por ning n lado todav a estamos a la espera de que se manifiesten si es que de verdad existen yo tengo muy claro que la verdadera y nica alternativa la m s adecuada de las opciones pol ticas es la que representa l pez aguilar somos muchos los que dentro y fuera del psoe pensamos de esta forma l pez aguilar ha sembrado en la sociedad canaria una esperanza de cambio profundo ha mostrado una forma muy distinta de hacer pol tica y eso ha prendido en la sociedad la verdad es que no veo alternativas y sinceramente creo que al final nadie va a presentar una candidatura diferente a la de l pez aguilar
1486494 el psoe siempre ha tenido a gala una cosa tras finalizar todo congreso los militantes cierran filas en torno al vencedor y estoy seguro que eso volver a suceder despu s del mes de noviembre

1486553 a person of interest is not an official designation it is abused law enforcement is politics those in power use the term to assure the public that theyre doing something police authorities fear admitting that they literally have no clue who committed a crime
1486554 unfortunately these politicians trash lives along the way the person of interest is someone against whom there is no real evidence but someone who can be at least for a time used vilified scapegoated its time our law enforcement politicians learn to say no comment and for them to educate the public that very often especially at the beginning of a case police have no idea who the perpetrator was or at least no real evidence the public should want responsible action and restraint not simply action the media should also cease its complicity in this charade and rigorously question politicians who finger someone as a person of interest asking what evidence the police have to support their grave allegation otherwise naming someone a person of interest cheaply serves many of the same cynical purposes that show trials serve in totalitarian regimes
1486555 the person of interest phenomenon is something like the opposite side of the coin from terrorist watch lists in the name of improving public safety government authorities want to create some status for suspicious seeming individuals that would enlarge governments investigative power without triggering the civil liberties protections that go with identifying anyone as an actual criminal suspect so far it is not at all clear how much safety the public is getting out of the shift to a preventive law enforcement mentality there is a substantial risk that we will wind up less free but actually no safer

1486562 bader is about delivering tangible results on the ground and involving strong partners we believe that the active involvement of the diaspora will be extremely beneficial to lebanon we are very happy with the response of top lebanese executives and entrepreneurs to our initiatives and we are looking to expand our initiative with them
1486563 the rationale behind the global business leaders conference is to have two way communication it is the only process that will allow all the energy of the diaspora to be efficiently channeled and have an impact in lebanon
1486564 we will follow up with the top executives who were present today on their support to the initiatives we have presented them today from the initial questions and comments we heard this morning i am confident that the momentum we created with our initiative will continue and strengthen in the weeks and months to come
1486565 this is a great initiative and i am looking forward to supporting it
1486566 we often thought about ways to bring our support to lebanon thanks to bader there is now a platform that will facilitate our support in a concrete manner
1486567 a long overdue initiative i am glad that bader is undertaking it

1486584 not only does tacc want to serve the life science community and be involved in their research
1486585 but we want to reach out to this community and bring them in
1486586 tacc is not just about high performance or supercomputing theres a wealth of infrastructure and expertise that we provide from expert consulting services to advanced visualization technologies
1486587 when you consider all of what we have to offer tacc becomes compelling to a diverse and broad base of scientific researchers
1486588 i heard from colleagues that ut austin had some amazing computational power but i never knew how to access it or what i might be able to do with it
1486589 once i began asking the right questions of the right people everything fell into place very quickly
1486590 its like getting an encyclopedia britannica with all the words but none of them formed into any sentences and you have to figure out how to put them together
1486591 understanding where a given word fits into that encyclopedia is very complicated but fortunately this is something thats been wrestled with and by using computers such as ranger were able to figure out how these things actually go together
1486592 emerging technologies in genomics and proteomics easily produce many terabytes of data and require the computational infrastructure that tacc can provide
1486593 if you have a good scientific question you can confidently assume youll get access to the systems
1486594 thats pretty phenomenal to be able to use ranger one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world for your research
1486595 computational biology has developed into an amazing tool to help biologists of all kinds do things that were never possible before
1486596 from comparing millions of dna sequences against each other to rationally designing drugs which target particular proteins for curing diseases computational biologists now have access to powerful tools that help them ask questions in new ways and achieve answers rapidly
1486597 from cancer research to basic aspects of life and disease to new technologies that will enable us to do everything from detecting birth defects in unborn children to blood doping in the tour de france
1486598 biology is fundamentally important to our understanding of life and computers will continue to play an increasing role in those efforts
1486599 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1486600 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law

1486602 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law

1486630 now god gave solomon wisdom and very great discernment and breadth of mind like the sand that is on the seashore 30 solomons wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the sons of the east and all the wisdom of egypt 31 for he was wiser than all men than ethan the ezrahite heman calcol and darda the sons of mahol and his fame was known in all the surrounding nations 32 he also spoke 3 000 proverbs and his songs were 1 005 33 he spoke of trees from the cedar that is in lebanon even to the hyssop that grows on the wall he spoke also of animals and birds and creeping things and fish 34 men came from all peoples to hear the wisdom of solomon from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom

1486670 they think its funny that theyre making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework
1486671 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1486672 rather than demanding americans inflate their tires obama should be demanding congress return to dc to vote on a real energy plan obama is wrong inflated tires are no substitute for oil drilling and a comprehensive energy plan

1486734 after serving in vietnam for a grand total of 4 months john kerry used his opposition to the war to launch his political career
1486735 if everybody in america inflated their tires to the proper level we would actually probably save more oil than all the oil that wed get from john mccain drilling right below his feet
1486736 they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by three to four percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant
1486737 but whos really out of touch the bush administration estimates that expanded offshore drilling could increase oil production by 200 000 bbl per day by 2030 we use about 20 million bbl per day so that would meet about 1 of our demand two decades from now meanwhile efficiency experts say that keeping tires inflated can improve gas mileage 3 and regular maintenance can add another 4 many drivers already follow their advice but if everyone did we could immediately reduce demand several percentage points in other words obama is right
1486738 obama is wrong inflated tires are no substitute for oil drilling and a comprehensive energy plan
1486739 john mccain says barack would rather lose the war to win an election he just said something like that despite the fact that if we had followed my recommendation not to go into the war in iraq we would have about an extra trillion dollars to rebuild our economy we would have been on the path of energy independence we would have finished the job in afghanistan and gone after qaeda
1486740 ive got truth on my side i fear no man when ive got truth on my side

1486744 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers
1486745 andrew jackson was a backwoodsman john kennedy had his clan ronald reagan was forever associated with the small town virtues of dixon and jimmy carter with plains
1486746 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1486747 so what if the editors do something i dont find useful there is nothing stopping me from setting up my own planet of code4lib authors for my own use if i feel so strongly about an issue
1486748 why cant this just be strongly typed so i know what to expect and do
1486749 expressed anxieties characteristic of a large section of american opinion on whose support we have hitherto been able to count
1486750 in preventing arab refugees from returning to their native land the jews may be subject to the same kind of criticism for which i and others have criticized intolerant gentiles now we have a situation in which the jews have done to others what hitler in a sense did to them
1486751 sees no need to run after peace the armistice is sufficient for us if we run after peace the arabs will demand a price of us borders or refugees or both let us wait a few years
1486752 i am prepared to get up in the middle of the night in order to sign a peace agreement but i am not in a hurry and i can wait ten years we are under no pressure whatsoever
1486753 final settlement of questions outstanding between the governments and authorities concerned
1486754 to shoot to kill all who broke the curfew there shall be no arrests
1486755 the revelation of sinai has been renewed in our time by our armys thrust of heroism our army did not infringe on egyptian territory our operations were restricted to the sinai peninsula alone the armistice agreement with egypt is dead and buried the armistice lines between us and egypt have also given up the ghost we are prepared for negotiations for a firm peace we are prepared for similar negotiations with each of the other arab states
1486756 yotvat the island of tiran will once more become a part of the third kingdom of israel
1486757 i have learned that the state of israel cannot be ruled in our generation without deceit and adventurism
1486758 we were shocked and angry as hell when the israelis launched the surprise offensive they attacked on a monday knowing that on wednesday the egyptian vice president would arrive in washington to talk about re opening the strait of tiran
1486759 jews have to be smart no arab will ever accept this plan
1486760 a high palestinian arab birth rate is not a decree from heaven
1486761 we must make it clear to the arab minority that it is not free to maintain in this small and poor country the highest birth rate in the world we should also persuade the superpowers that one of the solutions to the problem of refugees residing in the opt is in the departure of arabs for the classical countries of immigration with international financing
1486762 we must settle wherever possible in accordance with israels defence and security needs and the future of its borders the jordan valley and the range of mountains are needed for our security we cannot yield on this point even if there is no peace
1486763 palestine is the homeland of the arab palestinian people it is an indivisible part of the arab homeland and the palestinian people are an integral part of the arab nation
1486764 palestine with the boundaries it had during the british mandate is an indivisible territorial unit
1486765 it is the duty of the israeli leadership to explain to the public a number of truths one truth is that there is no zionism no settlement and no jewish state without evacuating arabs and without expropriating lands and their fencing off
1486766 an integral part of the palestine national movement as represented by the plo
1486767 the government has worked to increase the population of settlements in the golan heights and the jordan valley and should war break out this is the line which will determine the results
1486768 the conflict between them shall not be resolved by military force but by peaceful means
1486769 what occupied territories if you mean judea samaria and the gaza strip they are liberated territories they are part an integral part of the land of israel
1486770 not a prerequisite for the reconvening and conduct of the geneva conference
1486771 the continuation of settlement is the backbone of the zionist movement in the west bank and it is the only means to defeat any peace initiative which is intended to bring foreign rule to judea and samaria
1486772 march together toward a just peaceful settlement of the middle east issue it was envisaged that the plo would be represented within a joint jordanian palestinian delegation and that if the negotiations were successful a palestinian jordanian confederation would emerge
1486773 an agreement between the plo and the labor party leadership regarding an end to the intifada before the general elections in israel in november
1486774 the damage to israels public relations would have been relatively small i still believe that there are opportunities to expel many people
1486775 term right of return is an empty phrase that is utterly meaningless it will never happen in any way shape or form there is only a jewish right of return to the land of israel
1486776 without the jordan valley without this protective wall we cannot protect the state of israel and therefore we will remain here forever
1486777 resolution 181 which speaks about jerusalem not being part of israel is null and void we have a very wide national consensus about this issue
1486778 to achieve this vision the palestinians must build trust by establishing a new and different leadership and by putting an end to all terror and violence
1486779 success in the war on iraq could fundamentally reshape that region in a powerful positive way that will enhance u s interests especially if in the aftermath of such a conflict we are also able to achieve progress on the middle east peace

1486785 i am hugely excited that rosie boycott has agreed to chair the london food board and champion the provision of high quality nutritious food in the capital
1486786 rosie is as passionate as i am about the importance of locally produced affordable food to our health and wellbeing as well as the role food can play in protecting our environment
1486787 rosie is bursting with great ideas on how we can boost the level of top notch food grown locally and support londons local independent food industries and smaller shops
1486788 all the international efforts to implement a 2 state solution cannot conceal the fact that a palestinian state is not viable
1486789 fadel shana appears to have been killed deliberately although he was a civilian taking no part in attacks on israels forces

1486805 i care about systems that help people come to their own judgements about what things are and what they mean and in particular i care about systems that allow a wide range of people to come to a wide range of these judgements
1486806 how do we continue to do what is appropriate and right contextually speaking
1486807 how do we adjust what we do to fit our changing environment e g to take advantage of new perspectives
1486808 how do libraries differ from other institutions of cultural knowledge
1486809 thirty years ago before i had studied zen i saw mountains as mountains and rivers as rivers and then later when i had more intimate knowledge i came to see mountains not as mountains and rivers not as rivers but now that i have attained the substance i again see mountains just as mountains and rivers just as rivers
1486810 whether one sees the path as the point or whether there is an attainable destination in mind
1486811 we reject kings presidents and voting we believe in rough consensus and running code
1486812 sincere leaders like herzl who will forget their private interests in favor of the public good we have many men like herzl all they lack is a realization of their own abilities and the courage to take the first step let such men appear and not hesitate and circumstances will favor them for mens ideas have matured and we are ready
1486813 should palestine fall within the british sphere of influence and should britain encourage a jewish settlement there as a british dependency we could have in twenty to thirty years a million jews out there perhaps more
1486814 a serious modification of the extreme zionist program for palestine of unlimited immigration of jews looking finally to making palestine distinctly a jewish state
1486815 for placing the country under such political administrative and economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the jewish national home
1486816 as a public body for the purposes of advising and cooperating with the administration of palestine in such economic social and other matters as may affect the establishment of the jewish national home
1486817 the united states of america favours the establishment in palestine of a national home for the jewish people
1486818 the arabs have come to see in jewish immigration not only a menace to their livelihood but a possible overlord of the future
1486819 we must ourselves prepare to carry out the removal of the palestinians
1486820 i am for a compulsory transfer i dont see anything immoral in it
1486821 the royal commission and previous commissions of enquiry have drawn attention to the ambiguity of certain expressions in the mandate and they have found in this ambiguity and the resulting uncertainty as to the objectives of policy a fundamental cause of unrest and hostility between arabs and jews the proposal of partition recommended by the royal commission of self supporting independent arab and jewish states within palestine has been found to be impracticable
1486822 the objective of his majestys government is the establishment within ten years of an independent palestine state
1486823 transfer does not serve only one aim to reduce the arab population it also serves a second purpose by no means less important which is to evict land now cultivated by arabs and to free it for jewish settlement
1486824 the solution is to transfer the arabs from here to neighbouring countries not a single village or a single tribe must be let off
1486825 it must be clear that there is no room in the country for both peoples if the arabs leave it the country will become wide and spacious for us the only solution is a land of israel at least a western land of israel without arabs
1486826 my greatest worry in those months was that the arabs might accept the un plan then we would have had the ultimate tragedy a jewish state so small that it could not absorb all the jews of the world
1486827 to discuss the problem of new jewish settlements and the question of the arab villages
1486828 a medley of weapons sten guns rifles machine guns and hand grenades
1486829 arab resistance feeble from the start soon crumbled when our men got to them many of the houses were empty others continued to spit fire but not for long
1486830 in half an hour it was over most of the arabs had fled into the darkness
1486831 when i left sappers were blowing up the houses one after the other the solid stone buildings some built in elaborate city style exploded and crashed within sight of jerusalem i still heard echoes rolling through the hills
1486832 a deliberate eviction of the arabs is taking place others may rejoice i as a socialist am ashamed and afraid to win the war and lose the peace the state of israel when it arises will live on its sword
1486833 there is reason to assume that what is being done is being done out of certain political aims and not only out of military necessity
1486834 intentionally left open the exit routes for the population to facilitate their exodus
1486835 this government has been informed that a jewish state has been proclaimed in palestine and recognition has been requested by the provisional government thereof the u s recognizes the provisional government as the de facto authority of the new state of israel
1486836 it has already been said that weitz gave an order to expel the arabs from western galilee this is the policy and thinking behind the destruction of the arab villages in the area
1486837 to hammer out a plan of action designed to achieve the goal of transfer
1486838 view also is that this momentum of arab flight must be exploited and turned into an accomplished fact
1486839 allocate 5 000 to ezra danin in order to begin destruction and renovation activities in the beit shean valley and in the sharon the coastal plain
1486840 retroactive transfer a scheme for the solution of the arab question in the state of israel
1486841 the cleaning up of the arab settlements cultivation of their fields and their settlement by jews and the creation of a labour battalion to carry out this work
1486842 in line with this i have given an order to begin these operations in different parts of the galilee in the beit shean valley in the hills of ephraim and in samaria meaning the hefer valley
1486843 nazareth is a holy place a holy town the world is watching us you are not going to be a victim here
1486844 we had specific instructions not to harm anything which meant that we had to take nazareth by stratagem
1486845 no settlement can be just and complete if recognition is not accorded to the arab refugee to return to his home
1486846 i put my village under the protection of the state of israel
1486847 the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbors should be permitted to do so and that compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing not to return
1486848 listen close to everybodys heart and hear that breaking sound hopes and dreams are shattering apart and crashing to the ground
1486849 and you believe theres good in everybodys heart keep it safe and sound with hope you can do your part to turn a life around

1486996 senator obamas stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized he has not changed his position he has continually campaigned against additional drilling calling the policy a gimmick saying it was a scheme and ridiculing those who support it with his steadfast opposition to john mccains all of the above approach to our energy crisis americans should know that barack obama remains opposed to additional domestic oil drilling speaker pelosi moveon org and the sierra club can take comfort from the fact that barack obama still opposes additional domestic oil drilling meanwhile the american people can be sure that john mccain will do what is necessary to reduce this countrys dependence on middle east oil and bring down prices at the pump
1486997 this wasnt really a new position what im saying is that we cant drill our way out of the problem
1486998 if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it this is not real i know its tempting the polls say the majority of americans think its one way well resolve our problems but its not real
1486999 now the latest scheme is well were going to drill offshore now i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey i understand how desperate folks are i met a guy who couldnt go on a job search that lost his job couldnt go on a job search because of the high price of gas just couldnt fill up his tank i met a teacher in south dakota who loved her job as a teacher on an indian reservation she had to quit because the drive was too far it was taking up too much of her paycheck i know how bad people are hurting so if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
1487000 last month senator mccain raised more than a million dollars from oil and gas company executives and employees most of which came after he announced his drilling plan in front of a bunch of oil executives in houston this is not a strategy designed to end our energy crisis its a strategy designed to get politicians through an election and thats exactly why washington has failed to do anything about our energy dependence for the last 30 years
1487001 this is a proposal that would only worsen our addiction to oil
1487002 and just like senator mccains gas tax holiday gimmick this is a proposal that would only worsen our addiction to oil and put off needed investments in clean renewable energy

1487019 the department of defense today announced the deaths of two soldiers previously listed as
1487020 a cooridnated attack on seven american soldiers an iraqi army interpreter saturday morning south of baghdad left five of them dead and three missing
1487021 gunshot woundes though it was unclear whether he was shot before or after blasts enveloped the soldiers two vehicles in flames said u s army lt col christopher garver a military spokesman
1487022 parked in two humvees in an area 12 miles west of mahmudiyah
1487023 a roadside bomb followed by gunfire officials said the two vehicles went up in flames and were spotted 15 minutes later by a surveillance drone after a nearby unit that heard explosions could not make contact with the humvees the extent of the damage made it difficult to identify the slain soldiers
1487024 if you want their safety do not look for them the islamic state of iraq said on a militant web site you should remember what you have done to our sister abeer in the same area the statement said referring to five american soldiers who were charged in the rape and killing of 14 year old abeer qassim al janabi and the killings of her parents and her younger sister last year three soldiers have pleaded guilty in the case
1487025 bodies were later found outside a power station south of baghdad mutilated and bearing signs of torture
1487026 abeers brother mohammed 13 told time he once watched his sister frozen in fear as a u s soldier ran his index finger down her cheek mohammed has since learned that soldiers name steven green
1487027 after sectarian violence increased after the samarra shrine bombing in february 2006 fundamentalist insurgents and shiite militias started to forbid women to drive cars saying it was unacceptable according to islamic law they threatened to kidnap women drivers or kill them and leave their bodies by the road they also said women would have a similar fate if they didnt wear the traditional islamic clothing an abaya and a hijab head scarf so women including me stopped driving i stopped driving even in my neighborhood which made me feel depressed because i felt like i had lost one of my rights i had always worn a hijab but women who didnt started to wear one to protect themselves not driving affected my work as a reporter and it was difficult to use other means of transportation such as taxis or buses i couldnt take my children to school or pick them up or even go shopping alone in the early 1950s iraq was one of the first arab countries that allowed women to drive cars during the hussein regime women drivers were very common on the streets and women even drove public buses or tractors in the countryside

1487030 denied a nomination by a woman who used the green party reportedly to pay off her debt before she switched parties
1487031 if the green party is to thrive it has to appeal to progressives like myself cynthia mckinney does not appeal but repels
1487032 there is a great feeling that cynthia mckinney will be the next candidate
1487033 since she has publicly asked people to donate to cynthias campaign it may not end up posted the convention isnt just about the national ticket on the charitable side

1487039 former u s rep cynthia mckinneys trek back from defeat takes her to chicago this weekend and an improbable political rebirth she is expected to be nominated as the presidential candidate for the green party of the united states and could appear on the ballot in as many as 36 states
1487040 clemente born in the south bronx is a graduate of suny albany and cornell univeristy
1487041 it will be interesting to see how cynthia mckinneys choice affects her chances for obtaining the gpus presidential nomination
1487042 former georgia congresswoman cynthia mckinney who seems poised to capture the green party presidential nomination in chicago this month is at this juncture in history the only vehicle through which progressives can both register their outrage at barack obama and begin the process of rebuilding a mass black led movement for real social change meanwhile the frequency of obamas right turns seem to increase in direct proportion to the nearness of the general election surely no one with a brain any longer believes that obama is a closet progressive or even a genuine liberal the question is how many progressives will put their votes and resources to honorable use
1487043 in her presidential campaign she has pushed for a quick end to the iraq war and has promoted impeachment proceedings against the bush administration she also has advocated a 10 point human rights plan that includes integrity in the nations voting system full employment and reparations to african americans over slavery which has been a plank in the green party platform
1487044 securing the green partys 2008 standard bearer position would bestow on mckinney the historic title of first african american woman to be on the ballot as a viable candidate of a major party for president of the united states that title alone will not only lessen the aura surrounding barack obamas position as the first african american male presidential nominee but she may also siphon off just enough left wing african american and women voters to sink both their chances for victory in the fall
1487045 for president green party the party for feminists lets replace pelosi with sheehan as soon as possible and then as fast as we can replace the entire woman hating democrat party with a green ecofeminist progressive socialist one that really works and is not afraid to make campaign finance reform a priority

1487047 well tom maybe you should have critically looked at obamas slipperiness on this and many other issues before making a fool out of yourself
1487048 nothing of that nature will occur because hayden and other progressives are not organizing to make it occur they are too concerned with remaining for obama not only are haydens and fletchers peculiar movements without political content they emerge like magic requiring none of the hard work of organizing and just how were those popular rising expectations that hayden speaks of supposed to express themselves progressives waited until it was far too late to bring these expectations to whatever extent they exist to bear on the candidate obama coasted through the primaries with virtually no dissent from his loyal progressives and now sees his way clear to publicly dismiss them so as to never again be tagged as being on the left
1487049 calls for impeachment have become so common in the last few years that we forget how recently it has entered the political arsenal once viewed as a blunderbuss it is now used as a bludgeon

1487063 reading sarcasm is not that hard it just requires reading comprehension skills
1487064 i would so suck my own balls for a box of pocky
1487065 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1487066 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1487067 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1487068 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1487069 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1487070 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1487071 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1487072 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1487073 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1487074 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1487075 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1487076 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1487077 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves
1487078 and in total they caused widespread loses by banks retailers and consumers

1487157 they are very much women you even see what they are wearing ones dressed up in a bloody purple suit like shes going to whistler for the weekend oh im on a lovely little trip they have no idea of the dangers that they are getting themselves into

1487165 we feared the heartlessness of human beings all of whom are born blind few of whom ever learn to see
1487166 those of us who lintered in the world seduced by the annunciaion of wonderful events went through life with beautiful and fated eyes carrying within us the music of lovely and tragic mythology we are the strange ones with half our beings always in the spirit world
1487167 each of us made the passage alone alone we had to survive the crossing survive the flames and the sea the emergence into illusions the exile had begun
1487168 it is a good viewpoint to see the world as a dream when you have something like a nightmare you will wake up and tell yourself that it was only a dream it is said that the world we live in is not a bit different from this
1487169 the housing bill signed wednesday by president george w bush will provide a stream of billions of dollars for distressed homeowners and communities and the nonprofit groups that serve them one of the biggest likely beneficiaries despite republican objections acorn a housing advocacy group that also helps lead ambitious voter registration efforts benefiting democrats

1487179 seriamente edward non riesco a seguirti pensavo che non volessi essermi amico
1487180 ho detto che sarebbe meglio se non diventassimo amici non che non voglio
1487181 sarebbe pi prudente che tu non diventassi mia amica ma sono stanco di costringermi a evitarti bella
1487182 te lho detto sono stanco di sforzarmi di starti lontano perci ci rinuncio
1487183 s rinuncio a sforzarmi di fare il bravo dora in poi far solo ci che mi va e mi prender quel che viene
1487184 be io lo sento ecco perch mi viene la nausea sa di ruggine e di sale
1487185 non offenderti ma tu sembri il classico genere di persona che attrae gli incidenti come una calamita perci cerca di non cadere nelloceano di non farti investire o chiss cosaltro daccordo
1487186 e dai non dirmi che non ti rendi conto delleffetto che fai

1487198 we would never have used the air pistol if they werent so threatening

1487200 its still at an inquiry stage at the moment were still working on the robbery
1487201 i dont want other people to think its okay to do what this gentleman has done
1487202 a five star rating requires additional safety features such as electronic stability control esc
1487203 the more cars with esc on new zealand roads the more assistance drivers will have in regaining control in tricky situations
1487204 the purpose of ancap crash testing is to increase consumer demand for safety and encourage car manufacturers to meet that demand
1487205 results like this are great news and demonstrate the value of crash testing programmes
1487206 car ads are all very similar in showing the driver enjoying the moment the curving road ahead of them
1487207 we are after an audience that likes a performance car enjoys the moment of driving considers themselves a superior sort of driver its the area we want to be
1487208 statistically fatal speeding accidents tend to involve young working class males driving a japanese import
1487209 middle aged men driving new ford falcons have comparatively few fatal accidents
1487210 i dont know anything about this story i havent been told anything its not true

1487212 when we facilitate access to programs and help people understand their options we found that indigent patients actually picked up their medication more than patients with health insurance
1487213 it was surprising how many people obtained and benefited from their medications
1487214 the successful treatment of high cholesterol in either of these groups was higher than the levels that are usually reported nationally
1487215 these are important medications and the results here are actually pretty encouraging
1487216 this study would indicate that medication assistant specialists are of real value in improving health care for low income populations but not everyone has a program like that available to them
1487217 alternatively a good place to start would be your local pharmacist they should be informed about some of the assistance programs that exist and be able to steer people in the right direction
1487218 the air new zealand cup remains our premier domestic competition and we want to ensure it maintains its status as a true national championship that engenders provincial pride and rewards those players that perform in their club competitions
1487219 it is our belief that these changes and the management mechanisms will deliver on those aspirations and eliminate the sustainability issues that have challenged us with the current format
1487220 some of these ideas have been suggested or promoted previously and have been well supported in some of our research with rugby fans so we are excited at the prospect of putting them into action
1487221 we are very committed to ensuring that club rugby has its own time and space as we see the regeneration of the base of the game as critical to our long term future
1487222 he is a manchester united player its finished hell be playing here next season believe me its finished
1487223 it is the first of a handful of niches we plan to develop over the next few years that will enable us to best serve stroke patients in our community
1487224 banner baywood medical center demonstrated that its stroke care program follows national standards and guidelines that can significantly improve outcomes for stroke patients
1487225 this is a very significant discovery because of the terrible decline in population of these magnificent creatures to ebola and bush meat
1487226 if these new census results are confirmed they are incredibly important and exciting the kind of good news we rarely find in the conservation of highly endangered animals
1487227 far from being safe the gorillas are still under threat from ebola and hunting for bush meat we must not become complacent about this ebola can wipe out thousands in a short period of time
1487228 it is not too late for our close cousins the primates and what we have now is a challenge to turn this around
1487229 its definitely full on its technical and its also very physical because the water is really big and demanding
1487230 youve always got to be on the ball i like the course because you have to be able to read the white water and handle it to your advantage
1487231 from all the girls that ive watched all of them are doing good stuff and not so good stuff
1487232 the water is so unpredictable everyone seems to be having a hard time on it at some point
1487233 its so easy to miss a gate and get a 50 second penalty so some of the big names could be missing out on the semis definitely its going to come down to the day
1487234 with so many features here theres a lot to take in but i think weve done quite well im slowly getting there
1487235 i am advised that the total cost of repairs alterations or remedial work on hmnzs canterbury cannot be finalised until the ship is fully introduced into service and all outstanding warranty issues are resolved
1487236 the fact they have come this far is a good positive sign
1487237 as each week goes by i get more confident the eggs will last
1487238 with these guys foreplay might take years one has to be patient
1487239 some bloggers have instantly assumed the reports to be correct and have wondered out loud why others havent followed suit in excoriating edwards as a shameless philanderer

1487244 it doesnt seem to be on the wish list they want yards and garages theyre not asking for smoke alarms and that sort of thing
1487245 once weve gained the confidence of the people weve got more chance of doing more things
1487246 theres some bloody dead fish you have to swallow to get into government to do the kinds of things you want to do
1487247 is this what she meant when she said hard hats on is this the new dirty tactics low level that we can expect
1487248 if shes going to do everything from rort the electoral law to get journalist and author nicky hager to listen into our emails to go out there and get young labour affiliates to be bugging our personal conversations well thats her style of politics
1487249 we dont know where these recordings came from theyre lashing out and trying to divert people from the focus that senior national mps have been caught out telling the truth
1487250 who knows whether these tapes are actually sort of completely real they could well have been doctored no one really knows this stuff
1487251 we dont speak in sound bites we dont speak in press releases but effectively if every single word you say is going to be recorded then thats the way you have to speak
1487252 i have absolutely no idea who the person is that was speaking to mr english and dr smith when they were caught telling the truth
1487253 the national party was very happy to use that particular recording at the time
1487254 caught out obviously planning not to tell the people about their true intentions
1487255 this new line from national directly contradicts yesterdays apology and the claim from bill english that he should have chosen his words more carefully
1487256 today national didnt need to choose its words more carefully because it says its words were doctored unfortunately mr key hasnt presented any evidence at all that the tape recordings were doctored and bill english himself admitted the comments so why now claim the tape was doctored
1487257 the more likely explanation is that national is planning to sell kiwibank and mr english simply told the truth in private and national has been scrambing to cover its tracks ever since
1487258 thats what you sort of do when you have been in opposition for a long time because government programmes get rolled out and get entrenched and people rely on them
1487259 look weve been very upfront with our agenda weve been talking at the weekend a lot about how to get new zealand moving again how to deliver infrastructure theres no hiddenness about the fact we wanted to use some debt to finance that theres no secret agenda we have an agenda that says we are going to do the right thing by new zealand
1487260 i think at the end of the day all this sneaky underhand taping of conversations will bight the labour party in the bum
1487261 this new line from national directly contradicts yesterdays apology and the claim from bill english that he should have chosen his words more carefully
1487262 walter sa doch in der ddr ein paar jahre in hohensch nhausen irgendein nachbar hat ihn damals verpfiffen ist dort wohl ziemlich derbe misshandelt worden folter und so na ja auf jeden fall kam er ja nach der wende frei und arbeitete seitdem als kurierfahrer vor nem halben jahr musste er dann inner unternehmensberatung was vorbeibringen und wen trifft er da den stasibeamten der ihn gefoltert hat

1487266 while management is developing initiatives to generate sales in the latter half of 2008 the company has slowed its development programme down both in response to current demand and to save costs where practicable
1487267 assuming no adverse unforeseen events the board does not expect that the 2008 results will run at a loss
1487268 once we get into racing proper thats when the world body fisa officials start taking those slots
1487269 now you just see bureaucracy getting in the way of some of what we do but there are no major dramas at all
1487270 its certainly not what we want to be doing on race day
1487271 being within five minutes of the rowing course will be worth every cent well gear into a more rowing team focus
1487272 a lot of the things we thought wed have headaches with are not there
1487273 the expectations are probably harder on ourselves than any external pressure
1487274 the team hasnt changed pace with what theyre doing its a very very experienced group and to a certain degree were in our own little bubble as a rowing team
1487275 the key is to not look at any medal tables that will take care of itself
1487276 the day they got in the first thing everyone did was get in the boats and get going
1487277 well it was kind of a struggle but im in bangkok the flight got into hanoi at about 9 30 and the lobby was total chaos i had originally hoped to be able to book that night but it would have taken hours to get to the counter so i got a taxi to the noi bai hotel which apparently is run by vietnamese airlines the taxi assignment lady told me it was 60 000 but the driver wanted 100 000 i gave him 4 00 and he left the ride was just over a mile asia air was to have a flight the next morning at 9 15 so i showed up at 6 15 but they didnt open until 7 from then on everything was smooth its warm here it wasnt cold in hanoi but drizzly anyhow ill be heading home in a few days have fun
1487278 security was tight and was a bit over controlling which is par for the course at these events and as par for the course i tried to get near the candidate when i saw another reporter there alex leary security tried to throw me out but i found a mccain staffer i knew and the person vouched for me
1487279 the campaign looked into this and found that no one from the campaign was involved
1487280 race played absolutely no role in any actions taken by our employees or anybody else in this case
1487281 it was just a really crazy situation we were being carted out of there and everyone was looking
1487282 im upset because my reporter was singled out for whatever reason that bothers me were just trying to figure out what that reason was
1487283 i think it was about security and security acting overzealous and security singling out a black reporter to be removed

1487340 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates

1487355 in the event of a decision against iran this country will suffer the same outcome as iraq iran is not any stronger than iraq and wont have the means to resist a military attack on its own

1487357 the next time some obnoxious jerk in a hummer or escalade cuts you off as if they owned the road perhaps you should consider the move taken by joachim schoeneich of neu anspach germany he has decided that a british army surplus fox fv721 makes the perfect family grocery getter and has even fitted a kiddie seat so two year old son paul can come along for the ride while most reports are incorrectly calling it a tank the fox is really an armored reconnaissance vehicle with huge tires rather than the tracks of an actual tank the overall size is not too unreasonable either being narrower than a hummer h1 and shorter than a regular chrysler 300 sedan shoeneich says its tricky to maneuver especially with its non functioning gun sticking out and lousy outward visibility still i suppose nobodys going to argue with you over that last parking spot

1487408 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1487409 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1487410 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1487411 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1487412 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1487413 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1487414 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1487415 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1487416 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1487418 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1487419 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1487420 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1487421 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1487422 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1487423 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case
1487424 it raises some real concerns with the tactics of the nra if theyve got one person maybe they have more if theyve done this dirty trick what else have they done
1487425 if theyre open meetings it may be underhanded and sneaky it may not be illegal
1487426 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal

1487499 the theocratic cast of mind is always reductive whether its in power or not the enemy the real enemy is always the imagination
1487500 i have doubts about the things im supposed to believe as a christian but i ultimately choose not to follow the trajectory of doubt instead i return to the things im supposed to believe and take comfort in them
1487501 its a great notion except that no one behaves including people who are supposed to know better
1487502 to sneak into his church someday with a bullhorn and call him out
1487503 by laying aside our best apologetic weapons of logic and evidence we ensure modernisms triumph over us
1487504 the idea that we live in a postmodern culture is a myth in fact a postmodern culture is an impossibility it would be utterly unlivable people are not relativistic when it comes to matters of science engineering and technology rather they are relativistic and pluralistic in matters of religion and ethics but of course thats not postmodernism thats modernism thats just old line verificationism which held that anything you cant prove with your five senses is a matter of personal taste we live in a culture that remains deeply modernist
1487505 modernism has already triumphed over the evangelical and fundamentalist churches their obsession with proofs and methodology as well as their insistence on the objective truth of their grand narrative demonstrates the ascendancy of modernity within those churches
1487506 truth as much as defending their privilege and power if the bible is gods absolute truth and they are guardians of that truth then presidents and prime ministers im canadian

1487510 at shelter we see many homeowners owing very small amounts of money whose lives are wrecked by some particularly sub prime lenders racing to repossess
1487511 the fsas call for fair treatment of customers is a good first step but as the regulator it must now put its money where its mouth is and clamp down on merciless mortgage lenders who are robbing people of their homes
1487512 surprised at the fsas observations on specialist lenders who have been working extremely hard to manage arrears
1487513 our data shows in these current market conditions more people are struggling to meet their mortgage payments and it is vital that firms treat them fairly repossession has to be the last resort
1487514 consumers generally arrived at the belief that lenders were not in a position or possibly not willing to take account of personal circumstance
1487515 one or two examples of intimidating contact were cited from customers of sub prime lenders including having experienced frequent phone calls at inappropriate times of the day demanding payment or calls warning of bailiff action
1487516 pursued pride put on proud clothing came all got up in garments garish to see
1487517 maybe there is maybe there isnt i dont know enough to say one way or the other
1487518 there is insufficient evidence for god and thus no reason to assert such a claim
1487519 the exclusion of anyone who sees reasons for a creator
1487520 his flews god of fine tuning is a far cry from the god of the bible
1487521 the gospels historical veracity has remained virtually in tact for 2000 years
1487522 its just that the claims warrant more skepticism when they purport to offer salvation and damnation
1487523 oh great not another guy who doesnt understand what a model is oh and this ones paying for commercials even better
1487524 theres about 3 000 worth of presents on our list bought for us by family and friends and we have received none of it
1487525 there was everything from vases to rugs to coffee makers these are the sort of things we will spend the rest of our lives using and would have provided memories of who was at our wedding now we will have to ask all of our guests to get their money back set up another list and go through it all again
1487526 by the time you have spent 700 on a hen weekend to barcelona and 500 on going to the wedding the last thing you feel like doing is buying them a gift especially when they present you with a list from the conran shop and everything costs more than 100
1487527 i remember a few years ago people were wondering if it was polite to send guests a wedding list but thats all gone now
1487528 now guests expect to buy something from a list the other change we have noticed is that people are getting married later in life and already have a toaster so now they are asking for things such as flatscreen tvs and ipods its now becoming increasingly common to ask for money perhaps to contribute to the honeymoon or to pay for a new kitchen
1487529 i dont know if they got it but the one that sticks in my head was the couple who asked for a hamster and someone bought them one
1487530 i was at a wedding where there had been two lists one was at john lewis the other at argos
1487531 as we came into the church rather than asking people if they were on the bride or grooms side the ushers were asking john lewis argos and directing people to opposite sides of the church
1487532 in the current economic climate it allows people to get married who might otherwise put it off because they cant afford it
1487533 you could say that but then traditional gift lists are becoming more mercenary it depends how you look at it i think this is a very personal gift because you are helping a couple avoid starting their married life in debt
1487534 no because people dont feel they can go to a wedding empty handed so they will usually always buy something and it alleviates stress for a lot of people
1487535 so we didnt need things like new cutlery but we did want nicer glassware things like a coffee maker and better bed linen weve been trying to keep it practical but we did put a cross trainer on kind of not seriously and somebody has already bought us that
1487536 nobody ever registers hedge funds in the uk if somebody did wed be scratching our heads over how to deal with it wed have to devise something
1487537 there might be only four or five chaps in a hedge fund office but they have so much money that it doesnt make much difference these guys will have big huge desks and lots of screens
1487538 when we look at clients we go through a very very robust process of due diligence
1487539 its very much establishing a relationship with a counterparty both parties want to be confident its going to be comfortable mutually

1487542 it northern rock needs more shareholder capital it does not have shareholders so it has to come from us
1487543 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1487544 just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1487545 at shelter we see many homeowners owing very small amounts of money whose lives are wrecked by some particularly sub prime lenders racing to repossess
1487546 the fsas call for fair treatment of customers is a good first step but as the regulator it must now put its money where its mouth is and clamp down on merciless mortgage lenders who are robbing people of their homes

1487551 how could a labour government let it happen my husband was in the labour party the north east is a labour stronghold so much in the region depended on the bank yet the government did nothing for three days
1487552 when the news came my heart sank i knew it was over my husband who had only recently retired from the bank came home and reassured me that it would be ok he said it was well run but i had a bad feeling about the way news had leaked out
1487553 the next day was like a rollercoaster it was like landing in the twilight zone we couldnt believe that nothing was being done we were not economists but even we could see how serious the situation was getting and how letting northern rock suffer would have terrible consequences for all the other banks
1487554 in effect they are telling the valuer to pretend that nr is no longer a going concern this is clearly not the case when it was able to raise 25bn or more over two years on top of paying punitive interest
1487555 this problem was acute at southwark a suite run entirely on overtime and which in spite of an earlier extremely critical internal report was still unfit for use

1487557 the government is intending to have a budget for what it spends in regulatory costs in the same way it does for departmental spending
1487558 you look at the existing stock of regulation which are already a cost to the economy from which you are able to make savings plus your new regulations which have a cost to them
1487559 you could imagine a situation where the budget is zero where you say every pound of cost that we need to bring in for new regulations can be offset by savings
1487560 if someone gets out of line and they are going over budget they must account to parliament
1487561 the area of climate change is very complicated and we felt it was safest to park it to one side and focus on the normal day to day regulation
1487562 were reminding entrepreneurial shell seekers that the tide in wirral goes in and out and even a little bit round the back who knows what prompted it getting away from the olympics perhaps but some of wen jiabaos countrymen were lucky to escape the incoming irish sea while out hunting razor fish on moreton shore this week this is a new one on us the only time anyone here has seen razors eaten was during one of ray mearss escapades into the british backcountry he seemed to enjoy them apparently theres big money to be made around 2 000 a day supplying the japanese market which makes you think now where did we put our wellies
1487563 will be more prolonged than we thought a year ago it is important to be straight with people
1487564 stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers but removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1487565 the government estimates that 2 5 million families are living in fuel poverty yet despite the billions in profits the energy industry spends just 50m a year combating fuel poverty and has only agreed to raise this to 150m by 2010
1487566 the problems relating to affordability and tight lending conditions run pretty deep
1487567 probably the main help it would provide is in helping first time buyers coming up with the deposit they need to buy a house
1487568 they are in such a mess at the moment you wonder if they can afford it
1487569 in a weakening housing market stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers and the wider housing market
1487570 removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1487571 philanthropic giving should not be a replacement for state support
1487572 i used to refer to people who carry the opinions i carry today as cynics and conspiracy theorists
1487573 the experience has made me extremely cynical of the police force the government the mod and the establishment
1487574 i let the story people wanted to tell me lead me to the play
1487575 i never asked a leading question and was careful to get people to tell me what they wanted to tell me its an important story it goes into every area of the state the government the judiciary the police the army and the mod
1487576 if it was suicide what made these four children do it
1487577 there must have been something going on to make four apparently happy and healthy people do that
1487578 but i wouldnt dream of telling you what they are ive looked at all the available evidence in the way that nicholas blake did in his review my ideas hold no more water than his in my opinion unless you were standing there when it happened you dont know
1487579 the play is focusing on the parents quest for justice rather than speculating on what happened
1487580 they know their own children they were such happy go lucky boys and suicide wasnt in keeping with the way their lives were going they are adamant their children didnt commit suicide so it follows that someone else killed them
1487581 it was subdued after the first two deaths but it rose again in 2001 and 2002 when you have a similar situation mysterious deaths and more to the point no investigation that shows the culture in the camp is at the core of this
1487582 it is an appalling wrong in a civilised society that four kids can die and we can allow our government to dance around justice in the way that they have i dont think its something i can walk away from
1487583 by the desire to change the political landscape in watford for the benefit of the conservative party
1487584 it was the individual impact of what he did that was so appalling i find it quite extraordinary my daughters were very upset to see it come to a point of determination was a great relief
1487585 this has been a traumatic period for all those who have suffered from his vile campaign
1487586 that there cornmeal wuz ground fresh from pigeon forge tn
1487587 country potters used to make things for everyday life like jugs for storage my grandfather while he was working for jugtown looked at the orient and began making decorative designs away from utilitarian purpose
1487588 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1487589 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if and thats a big if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1487590 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1487591 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1487592 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1487593 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1487594 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1487595 publicity for its own sake is not always approved by good usage
1487596 in order to be successful you gotta be ready to broaden your horizons
1487597 inequities in access to healthcare and disparities in health outcomes
1487598 the divide between rich and poor is rising at a troubling rate within subregions of asia pacific leaving vast numbers of mothers and children at risk
1487599 it is not just bigger health budgets we could make a big difference by focusing on the three or four states in north india where most of these children die governments need to tackle female discrimination in the region too half the child deaths recorded in pakistan india and afghanistan occurred in the first month of the babys life
1487600 india could learn from chinas experience in two big ways
1487601 one is getting health services out to the villages the other is female education educated women making educated choices has a big impact on the survival of their children
1487602 would not have the stomach for a beer in that bar
1487603 gets access to information of a personal or family nature held on information systems or computers which are public or private
1487604 means the existence of a reserved area away from others which is necessary to maintain a minimum quality of human life
1487605 we are used to these tactics from the iranians but the fact is that they havent yet broken things off
1487606 iran is a very important country that is on the active agenda of the entire world
1487607 i consider these discussions concerning the details of the visit irrelevant in the context of such an important process they will cast a shadow over the essence of the visit
1487608 now after the third hung jury the idea now that suddenly in tampa there is new information previously unknown about this kid who has been investigated ad nauseam for at least the last five years or so doesnt make any sense to me
1487609 at this point it seems to be more personal than professional
1487610 would likely pose an enormous financial and reputational risk to the company and the country
1487611 he said we couldnt afford to say no to anyone
1487612 if i had better foresight maybe i could have improved things a bit
1487613 but frankly if i had perfect foresight i would never have taken this job
1487614 she is not my mummy she is a stranger she took me from my mummy
1487615 i asked where that holiday was but the little girl was incapable of telling me i even asked if she was on a camping site or in a hotel but she was unable to say
1487616 it is a disgrace that we have been kept in the dark about the details of this sighting and perhaps many other sightings for the last 15 months
1487617 in this business there are too many players and when things turn bad it becomes a suicidal race
1487618 our charges remain within the limit we are allowed to charge by our regulator the civil aviation authority
1487619 more than three times the rate of inflation and totally unjustified at a time when most other uk and european airports are reducing costs and charges ryanair will continue to oppose this regulatory rip off
1487620 the french support was of a political military diplomatic and logistic nature
1487621 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1487622 we ask authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused french political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice
1487623 this is a very intelligent woman what is she doing outside of the governors residence
1487624 the woman is a phd is a woman like this really that stupid there is an incongruity and i have trouble accepting the governments claims
1487625 i call her the grey lady because she is almost a ghost a spectre whose cries and screams continue to haunt those who heard her
1487626 led by the american soldier placing his hand on one of her shoulders and the other hand on her back and her hands and feet chained together
1487627 this woman stayed there until she lost her mind until she became insane hitting the door and screaming day and night
1487628 this is one of the greatest lies of the 21st century
1487629 the public clamour has now forced them to own up
1487630 her rape and torture is a crime beyond anything she was accused of
1487631 she has had no access to any lawyer presume her to be innocent before proven guilty please how can this punishment be fit for any crime
1487632 they just release the information when it suits them everything we know about bagram means that we know she siddiqui would have suffered abuse
1487633 when i grew up i tried to ask but there werent really answers
1487634 during my theological studies at university it became clear that i couldnt be a minister in the church
1487635 i concluded that christianity was paganism one of its most important dogmas is that god became man and if god becomes man then man also can become god
1487636 well you see he is a father of course but ideologically there was no connection i was so involved in my conviction that i had found the right path all the other items no longer had any importance
1487637 for him that was the end of the world my son is leaving germany to study in a jewish rabbinical seminary he told me i was crazy and renounced me as a son
1487638 people there dont get married and if they do they have one child
1487639 but the turks and the other foreigners have many children so it is a question of time that germany will no longer be german
1487640 germany will leave the stage of history no doubt about it
1487641 all the great cultures have left the stage of history
1487642 the romans the greeks the egyptians the babylonians but this little people who gave so much to the world do not
1487643 the motive of the converts is to join the community of the victims if you become part of the victim community you get rid of the burden of being part of the perpetrator community
1487644 shear yashuv represents a person who ran away from the past
1487645 there were no jews in these stories and no nazis in these stories
1487646 no no there were no nazis we are not nazis we didnt know any jews we didnt know anything
1487647 people said now we have closed the circle now everything is fine
1487648 it was like nothing had happened but there were 11 000 jews in munich before the holocaust where are they now
1487649 because i was annoyed by how the narrative was fixed
1487650 there is something not right when you do it to get rid of your german burden
1487651 that is not honest in my eyes do you stop being the daughter of a wehrmacht soldier if you are jewish no that is no solution you dont get rid of it
1487652 to live here to work here to be this bridge between two worlds
1487653 that is another way of saying what i have already told you
1487654 they want to join the community of the victim they may have their own way of rationalising it
1487655 i was always looking for my place i hated catholicism i have hated it since i was 14
1487656 what counts is the deed in christianity it is enough just to believe
1487657 i didnt think of my family of being like the germans
1487658 you went in the classroom twice a week they told you you fell asleep
1487659 she was 13 she says she remembered there were jewish shops that got burned down and it was a big loss because she said you could always go to the jews and buy something and if you didnt have the money you could bring it in next time
1487660 i feel myself turning into a block of ice every time when i go back i have to force myself to melt down again
1487661 but it is not the way to work through the role of the parents in the war i think it is running away from it in order to be able to really work through the past you have to try to understand how could it be that your father was a mass murderer you have to think of the possibilities that had you lived at this time you might also have been able to do such things
1487662 being in israel is to keep away as far as possible from it
1487663 i am not sure to what extent they have really been accepted into israeli society i think they are struggling i dont envy them
1487664 you are not here to speak to me you are here to speak to my girlfriend
1487665 i met some who surprised me some of them were shockingly unintelligent i even wondered why they would have the intellectual independence to make this choice especially the people who chose to be ultra orthodox who chose to throw away their freedom
1487666 i was worried i would get hurt by information i didnt want to know
1487667 sometimes i feel that a lot of israelis live that way it is better not to ask questions and not be hurt and so you dont have to look at yourself or your family or your nation and you can live with the illusion of who is good and who is bad
1487668 i heard a boy next door call another boy a stupid jew
1487669 i asked my mother what is a jew and is it something bad
1487670 i was physically disgusted and i was totally disgusted by even my own germanness
1487671 and because this entered my mind so early it became as natural as brushing my teeth
1487672 i felt that i was being told that to be a good jew you had to hate arabs
1487673 it causes a lot of tension to come here and say the things that i say
1487674 because it would be very inconsistent to have had so much criticism of germans who were terrible cowards when it was still possible to say something and then to come here and not speak up for justice
1487675 dont think i havent thought about it in those terms myself
1487676 i had wanted to connect myself to a history i did not perceive as shameful now i am wondering if i will stay i am more or less sure that i wont sometimes i feel i am not built for it that i am not strong enough for this country
1487677 sometimes i feel that just by existing i am always wrong here but i cannot live with personal attacks now i cannot bear it
1487678 on the condition that you do not print my name
1487679 hans married my grandmother erna after she divorced my grandfather
1487680 i have neither any blood nor dna from adolf and his family
1487681 but i always appreciated that she told me the truth about it we spoke frankly i never heard that normal german lie you hear so often from that generation
1487682 she became one of those german ladies who cleared up after all the bombing
1487683 that is all that my mother brought home from the war i keep them to honour her
1487684 i saw my father very seldom and the times i saw him i was so proud to have a father that it was not the time to ask what he did in the war he died when i was 19 so i never asked him what he did
1487685 it was not a sudden light from heaven that came down
1487686 how could people be so stupid as to elect a person who was writing things like this its awful
1487687 i dont think you can really understand how awful it is if you dont read it in german i put it away but i keep it here
1487688 you raise up an army if you think you have to use it
1487689 i felt at home i was no longer living in a conflict i didnt have to reject the older generation and i thought i had met for the first time a nationality that at that point in history today it is more problematic still had good reasons to be proud of itself
1487690 the sharp distinction between the generations that committed the crimes and the generation born after wouldnt exist
1487691 when i hear my own son speak as i did last weekend i sat like this
1487692 two of my sons are chauvinists and one of them is even partially racist i cant listen to fascistic discourse i dont suffer that
1487693 each time i hear it is another time too much if the holocaust and the third reich have really somehow shaped me i am a sworn democrat i believe that democracy has to prove itself by keeping the rights of its minorities
1487694 i see that soldier trampling that child and in the end killing it and i remember that kind of aggression i remember the feeling of the child too i remember both i could see my father or my grandfather really standing there
1487695 is that since i came to israel that feeling isnt there any more
1487696 i love the house but we paid 151 000 and the mortgage is 168 500 we dont want to sell it but in any case the valuers say its now worth 150 000 we had to move to an interest only loan in april to cut costs but it is still costing us 150 a month more than before were on this rate for a year but now i worry that it wont get any better and we could be in this situation for years to come
1487697 every month we look around at mortgages and ive set northern rock on my google alerts page so i watch everything thats going on there were trying to do everything we can to keep the house
1487698 it northern rock needs more shareholder capital it does not have shareholders so it has to come from us
1487699 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1487700 just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1487701 how could a labour government let it happen my husband was in the labour party the north east is a labour stronghold so much in the region depended on the bank yet the government did nothing for three days
1487702 when the news came my heart sank i knew it was over my husband who had only recently retired from the bank came home and reassured me that it would be ok he said it was well run but i had a bad feeling about the way news had leaked out
1487703 the next day was like a rollercoaster it was like landing in the twilight zone we couldnt believe that nothing was being done we were not economists but even we could see how serious the situation was getting and how letting northern rock suffer would have terrible consequences for all the other banks
1487704 in effect they are telling the valuer to pretend that nr is no longer a going concern this is clearly not the case when it was able to raise 25bn or more over two years on top of paying punitive interest
1487705 he was very calm but i was extremely surprised i went straight home and switched on the news
1487706 i came in early the next morning and people were like zombies as we heard about the queues forming at branches and how the run on the bank was getting worse there was a feeling the bank was about to collapse
1487707 lots of people felt they had been let down by the directors that was their first thought not about the regulators or the government they asked why the board had paid themselves large bonuses only for us to almost go bust
1487708 people found themselves having quite a complicated relationship with the bank supporting the company on the one hand but not those running it
1487709 many of the people ive spoken to feel quite sick at what went on and will gladly take voluntary redundancy they want to get out and start afresh
1487710 people believe even after almost a year has passed that the decisions were made by the executives and they are the reason the company crashed and redundancy is looming
1487711 this substantial increase in revenues offers the iraqi government the potential to better finance its own security and finance needs
1487712 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves
1487713 we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank including outrageous profits from 4 a gallon gas prices in the u s
1487714 despite iraq earning billions of dollars in oil revenue in the past five years u s taxpayer money has been the overwhelming source of iraq reconstruction funds
1487715 it is time for the sovereign government of iraq using its revenues expenditures and surpluses to fully assume the responsibility to provide essential services and improve the quality of life for the iraqi people
1487716 to assume were going to pay for it all is just wrong
1487717 nonetheless the pace of spending has been held back by various factors including deficiencies in capacity and security
1487718 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1487719 it is kind of strange for a large predator like that to come that close to the house
1487720 the world is pretty hard pressed to find good stories about conservation these days
1487721 this is just a fabulous story these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the motherlode of gorillas it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species
1487722 if the data checks out we may even have to look at reclassifying their status on the endangered list
1487723 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1487724 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1487725 market conditions have changed during the course of the agreements
1487726 i firmly believe that long term coal will be a key component to global energy supply
1487727 i am confident we will earn a sufficient economic return on the investment
1487728 drax is now facing higher prices for co2 while receiving less free credits following the start of phase 2 of the eu ets however the outlook for drax has improved substantially over the last 6 12 months with higher oil prices more than offsetting the impact of higher coal prices and leading to higher forward margins for drax
1487729 randy has told martin oneill to get the players he wants and not worry about the money
1487730 if martin came to randy and said i need 30m for player x and the player would fit into what we are trying to do randy would have his cheque book out before martin could get past the players name randy has never said no to martin
1487731 coaches and captains are always going to have different views because they look at the game from a different angle
1487732 hell be different to michael because hes a different man michael had his style and that was very successful kevin will bring kevin pietersen which is crucial hell be his own man and thats going to be really important whats really promising is that the senior arm of the team is going to get behind him
1487733 kevin will need support from me at times and ill need support from him and thats the way the coach player relationship works
1487734 the coachs job is to try to take pressure off the captain but you want the captain to be fully involved because he feels and sees things the balance to the relationship is crucial so that the players are very clear which way its going
1487735 your coaching style changes with different people but your coaching philosophy doesnt change all that much i dont particularly see my views on the game changing
1487736 whats his vision going to be i guess all those things will be answered in the next year or so we can only wish him well from after the oval test match and well watch with interest how it all unfolds as coach and captain you need to clarify the roles its something graeme smith and i have done particularly well youve got to back each other up in the roles you do and youve got to have the same vision
1487737 would not have the stomach for a beer in that bar
1487738 when i came back from athens i ended up going into a lot of school visits doing assemblies and talks and i got it into my heart that i would like to work with kids
1487739 i started doing mentoring work with kids who were three or four years below where they should have been academically
1487740 i decided then that i wanted to work with disruptive kids in some form i think it is either something you can or you cant cope with so i decided to put myself in the most extreme position that i could so i did some work at a young offenders institution i realised i could cope with it so i decided to try it full time
1487741 my faith is really important to me i look back on my life and see that i have been put in these places which appear to be random but as i see it i have found something that i am really good at and god has put me here as a witness for him he has got my life in his hands and this is where he is taking me
1487742 im quite lucky everyone in my team knows that i am a christian but they see that i am just a normal person i get on with my rowing i train hard im not strange because im a christian but i believe in god and its a big part of my life
1487743 there is a lot of pressure on us but the internal pressure we put on ourselves and each other in the crew is just as significant
1487744 we expect 100 from each other thats the sort of pressure we are used to every day and every year the external pressure from the press from friends and family and the supporters is not something we are used to and we are going to have to learn to deal with that and use it
1487745 ive been fighting for this seat since october and its been up and down because you never have a perfect winter but its really good for the team to have competition and to have people snapping at your heels
1487746 people see the races on tv and think that must be hard but they dont see the work that goes into it
1487747 and then it all comes down to one race and you have to get it right in a sense i will have been training for 11 years for one six minute race how much more pressure can you get than that
1487748 the bars and the floor are my two strongest events so im going to concentrate on them
1487749 my main aim is to help the team qualify for the team final
1487750 a group of sailors who have really left no stone unturned in their quest for success the four medal target is realistic we recently increased that target from three to four and if we win four ill be very happy
1487751 he was very calm but i was extremely surprised i went straight home and switched on the news
1487752 i came in early the next morning and people were like zombies as we heard about the queues forming at branches and how the run on the bank was getting worse there was a feeling the bank was about to collapse
1487753 lots of people felt they had been let down by the directors that was their first thought not about the regulators or the government they asked why the board had paid themselves large bonuses only for us to almost go bust
1487754 people found themselves having quite a complicated relationship with the bank supporting the company on the one hand but not those running it
1487755 many of the people ive spoken to feel quite sick at what went on and will gladly take voluntary redundancy they want to get out and start afresh
1487756 people believe even after almost a year has passed that the decisions were made by the executives and they are the reason the company crashed and redundancy is looming
1487757 i remember the great clubs that won the european cup back to back and that is the gauntlet that we have thrown down to ourselves
1487758 we want to become a really great team if we can get back to that final again and win it again then we can start talking about being a really great team
1487759 as of now we are a team that has been successful but we still have a lot more to give the manager has spoken to us about it but he didnt need to as the players understand clubs like madrid and milan and bayern have won it many times and if we can get our name up with them then we know we are a very great team you will be one of the best if not the best teams of your era and there can be no better incentive than that
1487760 ryan giggs told the players after the final that he had had to wait nine years for his second champions league final and i thought straight away that i have not got nine years to wait
1487761 i want to get there and touch that trophy as soon as possible i was sat in the dressing room after the final with michael carrick and owen hargreaves and we said to each other that this was too good to be true and that we wanted to achieve it again as soon as possible we all said that we had to get back there again
1487762 we have to do what we did last season but better
1487763 we have young players like anderson nani wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo these guys are all young and talented and all have much to give they wont reach their peak for a few years yet and so they have more to give us i am sure as players that they will be looking at what they did last season and think that they can improve on it and the club will facilitate that
1487764 the government is intending to have a budget for what it spends in regulatory costs in the same way it does for departmental spending
1487765 you look at the existing stock of regulation which are already a cost to the economy from which you are able to make savings plus your new regulations which have a cost to them
1487766 you could imagine a situation where the budget is zero where you say every pound of cost that we need to bring in for new regulations can be offset by savings
1487767 if someone gets out of line and they are going over budget they must account to parliament
1487768 the area of climate change is very complicated and we felt it was safest to park it to one side and focus on the normal day to day regulation
1487769 in this business there are too many players and when things turn bad it becomes a suicidal race
1487770 our charges remain within the limit we are allowed to charge by our regulator the civil aviation authority
1487771 more than three times the rate of inflation and totally unjustified at a time when most other uk and european airports are reducing costs and charges ryanair will continue to oppose this regulatory rip off
1487772 it northern rock needs more shareholder capital it does not have shareholders so it has to come from us
1487773 3 4bn of the governments loan to northern rock is now being converted into ordinary shares which rank right at the bottom for repayment continuing losses at the bank put this money at great risk
1487774 just six months after nationalisation we learn part of that loan is being written off to recapitalise the bank after these disastrous losses
1487775 people have stopped spending on the home its not only in the carpet industry its in furniture curtains bedding everythings gone quiet in that area
1487776 people have got more indebted than they were in 1974
1487777 i think people have recognised the amount of investment that has gone into sport over the last 10 years but they will certainly measure that by outcomes and thats why these games will be important because weve handed the opportunity to give the athletes time to train
1487778 we do have a very strong team better financed and better resourced than ever and i believe this will deliver the goods and we will move significantly forward from 10th
1487779 for a number of sports we also want to see real progress towards 2012 we are confident we will move forward from 10th but it would be unwise to speculate how close we will get to fourth
1487780 the medal targets make no difference to what we do we know where we are at where the opposition are at and what times we are looking to ride so rather than working on medals we work on our specific targets
1487781 we have got everything mapped out if we achieve those times then i am very confident that we will have moved on from where we were in athens as for overall targets i think we have no choice but to move forward we are really well funded we have a fantastic elite system so it is set for a nation like ours to move forward and it would be unacceptable not to
1487782 without a doubt there has been an impact and an increase in the anti doping movement is a good thing
1487783 i know for a fact the riders are starting to self police dopings not acceptable now and they are pointing the finger at people who are ready to be involved in doping for a sport like ours thats quite a shift from decades ago when it was the norm
1487784 we have to have the expertise to relate well with government uk sport and the mayor when the games are over we also need to be pushing for a sports legacy we need to have a significant increase in funding
1487785 how could a labour government let it happen my husband was in the labour party the north east is a labour stronghold so much in the region depended on the bank yet the government did nothing for three days
1487786 when the news came my heart sank i knew it was over my husband who had only recently retired from the bank came home and reassured me that it would be ok he said it was well run but i had a bad feeling about the way news had leaked out
1487787 the next day was like a rollercoaster it was like landing in the twilight zone we couldnt believe that nothing was being done we were not economists but even we could see how serious the situation was getting and how letting northern rock suffer would have terrible consequences for all the other banks
1487788 in effect they are telling the valuer to pretend that nr is no longer a going concern this is clearly not the case when it was able to raise 25bn or more over two years on top of paying punitive interest
1487789 we will try to be wiser we need to show people we are still the gunners and can win the title
1487790 it was difficult for me personally to see my team mates losing points when he was injured after the chelsea game but it was not just me everything changes players have to play in what is not their right positions and it is really difficult when you have to change things
1487791 i am very happy because until now i have not been playing for five months so it is great to be back we have been getting better and better we are playing quite well and have won against a top team like real
1487792 we showed everyone we can still play well even if we have lost some players now we have to win the title we play to win everything and we will try to do it
1487793 samir nasri is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him i have played alongside him in the french team and i know he will find his place in the arsenal team i think he can do it and will show everyone he can play very well
1487794 everyone the fans as well are all very happy he is a very good player and it is important for us to keep him
1487795 i am confident he can do it again and he wants to show he is always a good player even if people were speaking to him this summer he stayed and that is good for us
1487796 at the time they were too good for me but you become a more positive person as a result i wouldnt say a more careless person but more fearless
1487797 its just like if you let a dog roam on the streets eventually it becomes fearless because it has been through so many downs that is how i feel right now i am not saying i have been through a lot of low stuff but i feel as if this time i just dont fear it
1487798 id love to know why it is that owais can make a test debut and play extremely well make runs consistently for the last five or six years and why he is being overlooked
1487799 if you look at the england set up on the one hand they make it very plain that they try to have a pecking order then all of a sudden they will jump outside of that when it seems to suit them i think thats confusing for players
1487800 you only have to look at the darren pattinson selection kabir ali has taken 50 wickets and hes wondering what he has to do
1487801 the continuing downward trend in consumer confidence is not surprising given the recent batch of poor economic data talk of the increasing chances of a recession more weakening in the housing market and the continuing rise of food and energy costs will have further dented confidence as will reports of job losses
1487802 the british economy is now teetering on the brink of recession we are now facing the consequences of an economy which has been driven on the back of an unsustainable level of debt for several years
1487803 as the credit binge ends we are now feeling the hangover after years of ignoring the instabilities in the economy gordon brown must act now to stop a slowdown becoming a recession
1487804 throughout his years at the treasury the prime minister has ignored britains manufacturing industry now with growth in the housing and financial services sectors stalled britain is paying the price for this neglect
1487805 while the uk cips markit report on services improved slightly in july the survey still suggests that the economy has just about ground to a halt with the manufacturing and construction surveys already released also remaining weak a weighted average of the surveys continues to suggest that gdp has stagnated
1487806 no but we could have used the jaws of life to pull the drivers shorts out of his tail end
1487807 the international leg of the beijing olympic torch relay was close to a disaster that was beyond the control of the ioc and the organising committee
1487808 my view is that there should be an analysis of how this happened and a resolution to do away with the international portion of the torch relay the high risk and low reward of the international leg is now obvious
1487809 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1487810 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern to the committee the committee will continue to monitor economic and financial developments and will act as needed to promote sustainable economic growth and price stability
1487811 the fed is well aware that confidence in the us economy is still fragile the well documented credit crunch has certainly slowed us economic growth but the latest figures show the us economy is still growing and only time will tell if earlier rate cuts will repair some of the damage done
1487812 i love the house but we paid 151 000 and the mortgage is 168 500 we dont want to sell it but in any case the valuers say its now worth 150 000 we had to move to an interest only loan in april to cut costs but it is still costing us 150 a month more than before were on this rate for a year but now i worry that it wont get any better and we could be in this situation for years to come
1487813 every month we look around at mortgages and ive set northern rock on my google alerts page so i watch everything thats going on there were trying to do everything we can to keep the house
1487814 market studies show that the majority of people we serve do not want to live like their grandparents did
1487815 this is about turning something into a lifestyle and living that happens to have retirement in it
1487816 will be more prolonged than we thought a year ago it is important to be straight with people
1487817 stamp duty acts as a material disincentive to moving and reforms would help first time buyers but removing stamp duty only addresses buyer confidence not the wider problems in the financial markets
1487818 the government estimates that 2 5 million families are living in fuel poverty yet despite the billions in profits the energy industry spends just 50m a year combating fuel poverty and has only agreed to raise this to 150m by 2010
1487819 it seems that the market is losing interest in geopolitical and weather induced props and instead is becoming more aware of growing supply demand imbalances
1487820 this is the time of seeds the harvest for all my tribe
1487821 as far as bill is concerned the club has been for sale for the last five years this is nothing new bill has always said that he would sell the club if the right people with the right finance came along
1487822 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1487823 i am hoping we will have some new players in before the start of the season
1487824 but i am not going to turn around and say i am totally confident because you never know what happens but yes i am hoping that we will end up getting a few in
1487825 he let us know in no uncertain terms that the season is only two weeks away
1487826 he told us that we had to stop feeling sorry for ourselves stop thinking about who we are going to bring in stop thinking about everything else that is going on and to just get on with playing football
1487827 we cannot do anything about what is happening with transfers and the other speculation all we can do is play football and apart from lee carsley it is the same starting xi that was here last season so we have no excuses
1487828 weve got a wage structure at west brom and the players all understand that its a philosophy i try to have and it wont be broken
1487829 but sometimes the expectations from players advisers are way beyond where we can go thats fine by me but the search for new players is continuing
1487830 philanthropic giving should not be a replacement for state support
1487831 men have been under siege by a culture that too often embraces the notion that men are to blame for all lifes ills
1487832 i define power as control over ones life a balanced life is far superior to the male definition of power earning money someone else spends while he dies sooner
1487833 there have to be some places on the planet where you dont go for energy production
1487834 they have taken natural landscapes and turned them into industrial sites
1487835 the coalition gives us the chance to increase the volume and to represent ourselves as mainstream
1487836 i dont think this can go ahead this area is far too valuable there is a saying in business if you want to make omelettes you have to break eggs we dont want to be those eggs
1487837 i was thrown on the ground and noticed only the stalks of my flowers were left everything was still and quiet and when i got up there were people naked not saying anything some of them had no skin or hair i was certain i was dead
1487838 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1487839 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1487840 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
1487841 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
1487842 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence
1487843 unquestionably the best man to lead us into the next election
1487844 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity
1487845 we do have a communication problem here once the misconception has become sort of established in the minds of people its not that easy to get the right message through
1487846 i would not discourage athletes from wearing protection devices if they are concerned but i do not think it is necessary i would not wear one whether i was an athlete or not
1487847 exaggeration of the problem that has been seen in the media
1487848 those who standards are fairly tough to meet but in many respects the beijing area does so im sure im confident the air quality will not prove to pose major problems to the athletes and to the visitors in beijing
1487849 we have had some readings that were above the interim target data but since then they have gone down and been below that level we will evaluate those pollution levels and should problems arise we may have to take some action
1487850 to come to a city even though the air quality might be inferior the long term effects should no longer be feared by temporary visitors
1487851 we are bitterly disappointed the deliberate killing of these birds is one of the worst cases my department has dealt with in the last 10 years
1487852 i dont want to get involved in the fashion police of determining exactly what people can wear but the encouragement of business casual is where we are going
1487853 i firmly believe that long term coal will be a key component to global energy supply
1487854 i am confident we will earn a sufficient economic return on the investment
1487855 drax is now facing higher prices for co2 while receiving less free credits following the start of phase 2 of the eu ets however the outlook for drax has improved substantially over the last 6 12 months with higher oil prices more than offsetting the impact of higher coal prices and leading to higher forward margins for drax
1487856 this acquisition will allow us to achieve a deeper and more robust integration between the wide ranging global assets of the music company and sonys products operating companies and affiliates it enables us to offer a total entertainment experience to consumers
1487857 were reminding entrepreneurial shell seekers that the tide in wirral goes in and out and even a little bit round the back who knows what prompted it getting away from the olympics perhaps but some of wen jiabaos countrymen were lucky to escape the incoming irish sea while out hunting razor fish on moreton shore this week this is a new one on us the only time anyone here has seen razors eaten was during one of ray mearss escapades into the british backcountry he seemed to enjoy them apparently theres big money to be made around 2 000 a day supplying the japanese market which makes you think now where did we put our wellies
1487858 there are many parts of a power station that you can build such as the boiler house and turbines that have nothing to do with ccs
1487859 this draft document should not be viewed as signalling anything about our intention to require carbon capture readiness if consent were to be granted to e on
1487860 they reveal an extra level of collusion between the government and britains biggest single carbon emitter the energy minister has been telling the public that a new plant could bury its emissions but privately its department is telling e on it wont have to
1487861 you can buy eco fabrics yourself like organic cotton from hemp fabric uk you can buy natural dyes from companies such as fibrecrafts who offer detailed instructions on how to use pure colours such as turmeric and indigo
1487862 nobody ever registers hedge funds in the uk if somebody did wed be scratching our heads over how to deal with it wed have to devise something
1487863 there might be only four or five chaps in a hedge fund office but they have so much money that it doesnt make much difference these guys will have big huge desks and lots of screens
1487864 when we look at clients we go through a very very robust process of due diligence
1487865 its very much establishing a relationship with a counterparty both parties want to be confident its going to be comfortable mutually
1487866 there have been some good performances over the last few weeks
1487867 i felt we were really good against southampton we got a great win against porto and the feyenoord game was excellent the different formation worked well against feyenoord weve used it in a few games now and the boys looked comfortable with it the shape was good and against certain opposition especially in europe it could be really useful
1487868 and the midfield were able to get good balls into the strikers and into me as well you dont want to go overboard about the result because it was just a pre season game but there was a lot of heart to be taken from that performance
1487869 that might be true but at celtic we play every game to win it its what expected
1487870 i always like playing against premiership sides you always want to test yourself against that quality of opposition some people say the premiership is the best league in the world and it will be sides of that standard that well come up against in the champions league this season
1487871 we have to be able to redefine ourselves to meet these needs
1487872 baby boomers are not going to move into a nursing home and share a room with someone theyve never met in their 85 years
1487873 and boomers are not going to want to live in an age segregated community
1487874 our greatest competition is a persons own home so we want to create a community where people can live for the rest of their lives
1487875 if theres no margin theres no mission anything we do will have to stand on its own
1487876 we want to have a section for first time home owners as well as larger estate homes
1487877 there will be apartments for elders on one side of the square and apartments for any generation on the other
1487878 we really want the town square to be a center of gravity for everyone to come and spend time together
1487879 the real opportunity is to help people stay in their own homes and live out their lives they way they want to
1487880 like most crops truffles need water and warmth and thats what weve had this summer there are lots of truffles and we have found them up to 500g each bigger than cricket balls
1487881 we had a look at some three weeks ago but they werent right they had grown slowly because of the spring cold however since then we have had lots of rain which has helped them grow and it has also been humid so they are doing very well
1487882 they have got a couple of really old trees in the garden and we were just clearing out this wooded area when i came across this truffle it was about 7cm long as we carried on working we found about nine to 10 truffles
1487883 i would think there would be more in the garden and there are some more beech trees in neighbouring gardens i think it would be worth looking
1487884 it would take you a day to find a kilo of truffles in france
1487885 the key is we dont dig the truffles out we wait until they come to the surface and we only pick 30 or 40 of what is there

1487888 how long are we going to tell him he cannot have a game like that
1487889 do we really want to keep joshua from playing a game like that because joel shouldnt see it
1487890 i dont think your car will finish the first 800
1487891 build houses and settle down plant gardens and eat what they produce 6 marry and have sons and daughters find wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage so that they too may have sons and daughters increase in number there do not decrease 7 also seek the peace and prosperity of the city to which i have carried you into exile pray to the lord for it because if it prospers you too will prosper
1487892 of putting enough energy in the room to get people on their feet cheering and clapping but not getting in the way of the broadcast
1487893 there are millions of people watching at home and maybe 500 in the studio
1487894 so you sacrifice the people in the live audience to a certain extent to make it sound good at home
1487895 what impacts the broadcast is when you have three people standing around a sensitive microphone and you turn it up in the house
1487896 it becomes very reverberant and washes out what we are trying to get on air

1487899 the people got up and looked around and saw the mountain lions tail leaving the house
1487900 it is kind of strange for a large predator like that to come that close to the house
1487901 well partner big to big and acquire big to small or big to medium
1487902 so you could see us partner with an ibm or a microsoft or an intel and well acquire more like a web ex my favorite kind of company to acquire is one with a 100 engineers who have a hot product they are just about to release
1487903 tony blair was told by mi6 before the invasion of iraq that a high placed and potentially credible iraqi source was saying that saddam hussein had no weapons of mass destruction intelligence that was passed to the us but buried by the white house
1487904 the book claims that mr blair sent a top british spy to the middle east at the beginning of 2003 three months before the invasion to dig up enough intelligence to avoid war but that president bush and vice president cheney dismissed any claims or possible evidence that would derail the invasion
1487905 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1487906 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1487907 tony blair was told by mi6 before the invasion of iraq that a high placed and potentially credible iraqi source was saying that saddam hussein had no weapons of mass destruction intelligence that was passed to the us but buried by the white house according to an explosive new book the book claims that mr blair sent a top british spy to the middle east at the beginning of 2003 three months before the invasion to dig up enough intelligence to avoid war but that president bush and vice president cheney dismissed any claims or possible evidence that would derail the invasion
1487908 the letter does not mention the freeze for freeze issue
1487909 the five plus one proposal has a number of ambiguities that the iranians feel that until they are resolved properly iran cannot respond properly to the proposal itself

1487911 israeli defense minister ehud barak said israel will go back to carrying out military strikes on the hamas ruled gaza strip despite a month old truce army radio reported tuesday
1487912 those who miss the operations in the gaza strip dont worry they will come
1487913 dont worry we will continue to kill scores of palestinians
1487914 the soaring price of oil will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget surplus of as much as 79 billion by years end an american federal oversight agency has concluded in an analysis released on tuesday
1487915 every time bush threatens iran by saying that all options are on the table including the military one oil spikes
1487916 prices would go a lot higher and stay there too if the market really believed that an attack on iran were imminent
1487917 the message is clear the additional energy we need in 2050 over the current 13 5 tw base is simply not attainable from long discussed sources the global appetite for energy is simply too great
1487918 a new book by the author ron suskind claims that the white house ordered the cia to forge a back dated handwritten letter from the head of iraqi intelligence to saddam hussein
1487919 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion

1487930 it would be a great choice for me and i really want to go there michigan came to my school during the spring but i really havent been in too much contact with them since then
1487931 things have been slow but the coaches have all been on vacation and stuff
1487932 im expecting to be hearing from a lot more programs once school starts and once more teams can seem me play
1487933 it would be a great choice for me and i really want to go there
1487934 michigan came to my school during the spring but i really havent been in too much contact with them since then
1487935 they still send mail though and hopefully theyll come out to see one of my games
1487936 they had a great team last year and i think they are gonna stay on top for a while they are a well rounded program with great coaches
1487937 i havent talked to any of the coaches at nebraska yet so i dont know too much about them
1487938 they have great tradition and history and they are definitely a school i plan to learn more about during the year
1487939 i know a few guys there already and have a few friends committed there too including teammate three star running back
1487940 they have a lot of good experience and think the team is on the rise i also think i would fit in well with their offense
1487941 they woke up this morning and saw the chairs in the pool so that was pretty interesting
1487942 he said wed be ok once the storm passed over
1487943 but when we got here and saw people boarding up the windows my wife got a little nervous
1487944 the winds were blowing too hard out of the north

1487951 life is like a box of chocolates you never know what youre gonna to get
1487952 people and nations are forged in the fires of adversity
1487953 the advertisers are going to have to come to the table and say we have a solution for this
1487954 they have to tell the cable companies youve got the boxes
1487955 the set top box is really a significant capital cost for all the cable operators
1487956 any solution that you could propose to them that gives them that dvr functionality right now is music to their ears
1487957 cable companies are already in a situation where theyre looking at hd high definition and expanding hd channels im wondering how much bandwidth they really have at their disposal and wondering what the implications are long term if this technology takes off
1487958 theyve gone this far whats another 10 million in legal fees
1487959 theres always the possibility the supreme court will look at it and have a different perspective but i think ultimately the appellate court was pretty forceful in overturning the district courts ruling
1487960 a lot of people didnt buy dvrs for cost reasons or complexity but in the end the leading edge of consumers they do buy these devices and their experiences on the internet are showing that they are expecting a greater level of control over their media
1487961 synaptic hosting is at amp ts brand around their vmware based managed hosting platform it is to a large extent a repackaging and rebranding of the virtualization capabilities they acquired when they bought usi
1487962 its a nice platform and its what we expect out of a strong competitor in the hosting space but it is neither first to market nor exceptionally innovative it is simply a competitive offering
1487963 the synaptic hosting platform is similar to other such platforms such as terremarks infinistructure 2005 or savvis virtual intelligent hosting 2007
1487964 it is closest in capabilities to the savvis platform but at amp t has done a better job of integrating in related services such as security by bundling rather than selling them piecemeal as savvis does
1487965 the platform can scale up an individual instance from 1 core 2 gb ram random access memory to 2 cores 4 gb ram but cannot scale further either vertically or horizontally without human intervention manual provisioning intervals are measured in days not hours or minutes this is comparable to savvis but not to terremark whose enterprise cloud platform can scale arbitrarily with self provisioning and provisioning intervals measured in minutes just long enough for a data copy
1487966 many companies see the cloud as a place to host infrastructure utilities we see the cloud as a broader representation of the need to deliver services to individuals and companies over the internet this will include infrastructure as a core necessity
1487967 this is key at amp t has the challenge of actually delivering service well it is one thing for a telecommunications provider to deliver voice or data but quite another to deliver infrastructure services to those used to relying on data centers at amp ts internet data centers are also right in line with what others are doing on this front and we expect this trend to continue
1487968 were still somewhere between the bleeding edge and early adopter market adoption stage it will take years for developers to move mainstream custom application development to these on demand highly virtualized architectures
1487969 at amp t like many telcos must find a way to remain relevant to customers and to expend its relevancy to businesses as the internet and use of internet delivered services like iptv internet protocol tv and voip voice over internet protocol continue to erode telco uniqueness in order to prevent themselves from just becoming the pipe through which everyone travels they have to up the ante
1487970 google app engine is similar in concept what i think were actually seeing is a move toward web centric application platforms which will make providing addressable services to developers a key to success this is where i think amazon and google have an early edge

1487974 to protect our mutual customers by providing advance information about upcoming security releases this enables security software providers to protect customers more quickly against possible attacks
1487975 by receiving vulnerability information earlier customers benefit from additional possible improvements that provide security protection such as third party intrusion detection systems intrusion prevention systems or security software signatures microsoft continues to recommend that customers deploy security updates to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities
1487976 it takes a lot of trust to release this very inside information you have to be careful who you let that out to this really shows the maturity of the security industry its come a long way from the time when vendors would find flaws and make them public as a publicity stunt or to get a lot of coverage or press those days are largely past and microsofts trust in the security industry is highlighted by this move
1487977 the success of mapp will depend on the quality of the information provided by microsoft and the various security software vendors response
1487978 itd be an even bigger advantage for hackers as it is already a footrace between the security organizations and these malicious code writers its down to hours on patch tuesday you can imagine a week head start for a hacker would be very bad
1487979 it is important that information is not leaked to hackers but this is by no means the first program that microsoft has set up that shares information with other vendors they have plenty of experience setting up agreements regarding data confidentiality and probably have those agreements in place already as part of other microsoft security initiatives
1487980 pauschal als vorurteilsbehaftete dodeln hinstellt die vista nur kritisieren weil sie keine ahnung haben
1487981 hah ich hab das mc nur wei ich nich was ich damit soll
1487982 it was not just because of me everything changed some players were playing not in their positions and it is always difficult when you change everything but it was difficult personally to see my team mates losing games this season we will try to be wiser we will show everyone we are still the gunners and that we can win the title we play to win everything and we will try to do it i have not been playing for five months so it is great to be back here with all my mates we have been getting better and better we are playing quite well at the moment and won on sunday against a good team we showed everyone that we can still play well even if we have lost some players i think he samir nasri can do it and will show everyone he can play very well samir is a very good player and we are lucky to have signed him i have played alongside him in the french national team i believe he will show everyone he can play very well and will find his place in the arsenal team
1487983 we play to win everything and we will try to do it
1487984 the world is pretty hard pressed to find good stories about conservation these days
1487985 this is just a fabulous story these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the motherlode of gorillas it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species
1487986 if the data checks out we may even have to look at reclassifying their status on the endangered list
1487987 in many places primates are quite literally being eaten to extinction
1487988 weve raised concerns for years about primates being in peril but now we have solid data to show the situation is far more severe than imagined
1487989 friendster is growing at an enormous rate in asia pacific and is clearly leading the competition
1487990 with more than 75 million users it is clear that friendster has already made a dramatic impact i look forward to growing our business further as we continue our global growth and strong focus on asia
1487991 with the addition of richard butch and the new funding friendster will continue to expand its worldwide footprint and take advantage of its leadership position in asia pacific
1487992 restore the hearth as a ceremonial place and as a point of convergence
1487993 i think its a very well done and justifiable recommendation
1487994 they continue to say the jury is still out for men under 75
1487995 there are many doctors who believe staunchly that psa testing should be done in all men and there are probably an equal number of doctors who believe very much that testing is of limited value
1487996 thats because every 75 year old is not created equal
1487997 very active very vigorous and have minimal health issues and many of those men are going to live into their late 80s or 90s
1487998 it would be a disservice to patients to have their chronological age be the only factor making important health decisions
1487999 there are some very young 75 year olds out there
1488000 feel liberated from having to have the test its one less thing for people over 75 to worry about
1488001 hopefully within the next three or four years we will have some outcomes from those studies and be able to give a little more definitive guidance to men and physicians
1488002 you girls need to shut up and go to the pep rally we are having class in here

1488005 i was fortunate in that i felt comfortable talking about it with my doctors and my husband
1488006 but many women cant they push it down and bury it never to reclaim their sexuality again its very sad
1488007 for him it really wasnt the challenge it might have been
1488008 my husband understood that i would just be too tired sometimes but it also helped him to know that id get my energy back once i was done with the chemo and i did

1488013 his few responses are non verbal theres very little eye contact occasionally hell nod or shake his head to answer
1488014 a number of ambiguities which until resolved properly the iranians feel they cannot respond properly to the proposal itself
1488015 iran is trying to resolve these ambiguities and i think this letter is part of that process
1488016 enrichment of uranium is the only card iran has to play
1488017 giving up that card means it has to engage in negotiations without having any ability to pursue its interests
1488018 non enrichment has to be the goal of negotiations not a precondition
1488019 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well
1488020 first we will see what happens with the rest of the day that is left in europe and then they will have their call tomorrow we will see where we go from there
1488021 hasnt really changed as far as any suspension of its nuclear centrifuge activity is concerned
1488022 the best bet in terms of the interests of the west is to start negotiatons without any precondiditions and then in the course of negotations maybe we will be able to get more concessions from iran
1488023 sanctions havent worked and are very unlikely to work any further sanctions would really increase the price of oil and wouldnt benefit the world economy

1488053 for children who lived in a home with a man who married underage girls or agreed to an arranged marriage of an underage daughter the safety plans include a requirement to keep the children away from that man

1488100 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1488101 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1488102 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1488103 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area

1488142 originators are the ones that have to pay these up front fees and the originators need to be compensated they most likely will turn around to the borrowers and factor those higher fees into higher mortgage rates
1488143 whats the effect all else being equal it has the effect of pushing mortgage rates higher which is not exactly conducive to generating new business

1488157 therefore because she has proven that she has the ability to create print product for niche markets we have extended her distribution contact to include all new titles she wishes to produce
1488158 carrie is obviously pleased with her new contact and we are developing another title but are very cautious in that we believe that it is a mistake to produce a magazine that is replicated by thousands of internet sites nude is a one of a kind high quality magazine that carrie leigh created with every element of fine art and photography in mind her goal was to place a fine art quarterly back on the coffee table and by the success of nude she has obviously succeeded the new publication will have the same quality and impact of nude and we are looking forwards to its launch in 2009

1488267 think for a moment how you would feel if you were expected to join in the
1488268 your dad lost a few shingles on his house in the tropical storm hes going to call me later and tell me more
1488269 i thought it summed up sort of the spectacle that i was going to create to play live with
1488270 rock royalty i was thinking about that and over the years ive written so many different songs with so many different people i wanted them to sort of string together when i performed them and have some sort of bonding some glue and i think the glue is the orchestrations and having what i call a rock fabulous orchestra i can jump from a mick jagger song to a sinead oconnor song to a eurythmics song and it all feels cohesive and then i thought if im going to have this many people on stage lets make the whole band an orchestra and a spectacle when the curtain drops and you hear the beginning of sweet dreams and it comes in with the boom boom it looks like wow
1488271 hey thanks see a lot of people at first dont understand that theres not one secret or anything that electronic song has been recorded with horns and orchestra and real players and everything i tackled it by starting with the middle section you know that hold you head up part and it all builds up and builds up and then the strings start doubling and that high note from amy keys and then boom i really cant wait to do that on stage
1488272 ive never played live as me on a tour in america ever i did one test of a gig with an orchestra i flew to england and i played at the tower of london and i did this show with an orchestra we came back to america and we adjusted the scores and the orchestrations and we recorded a 21 song album that was like a test you know
1488273 oh yeah they said it was the best show they had in the whole 10 day festival
1488274 thats true im here in the office with a lady and were just doing the very final changes on the big coffeetable size book thats about the 21 songs and all the stories its got all these photographs ive taken over the years its funny because over the years thinking back i was really obsessed with orchestrations like on songs like here comes the rain again i would always say to annie weve got have an orchestra on this any opportunity i was just sort of mad about strings even when we started playing r amp b i was really mad about getting great horn arrangements i do love the marriage of proper rock music with real instruments
1488275 it really is funny because we could take the most electronic thing like sweet dreams or love is a stranger and play it with an acoustic guitar in fact the last time that annie and i really performed together in 2000 we were doing a 20 day tour just the two of us me on guitar and her singing we only got through seven and she twisted her back but the last gig we played it was just the two of us in front of 100 000 people in italy it was us with an acoustic guitar on songs that had complex arrangements and the whole audience just sang along i think its to do with when youre writing or when i write anyway with anybody i just dont like doing something on false promises i always like to check can we just sing this on an acoustic guitar or just with a piano that way you can really make sure thats a proper song
1488276 what i did was on the tour i play about seven eurythmics songs and then i play tom pettys dont come around here no more underneath it all from no doubt a duet i did with candy dulfer for lily was here so i actually have myself singing on lots of songs like the bryan ferry and the tom petty ones and i duet on here comes the rain again and i sing the miracle of love but when its a real out and out obvious female vocal type song i have four female vocalists on stage with me they are all very different voices amy keys for example is the main singer shes a real soul belter for songs like missionary man or would i lie to you shes got that voice and then i have sierra swan whos a more alternative edgier singer and more for songs like thorn in my side love is a stranger and sweet dreams what i do with all the female singers is treat their voices like instruments in an orchestra
1488277 amy is more like the brass section and cindy is more like the violin if you will the front line is actually me four women and mike bradford a bass player
1488278 absolutely you are absolutely correct i describe it in my book that with missionary man i was creating kind of a voo doo concoction and thats why in the video its like im making a weird experiment and it turns into annie but for this album i did this same kind of feeling with sweet dreams with this blues waling on top of strings you hit it right on the head you are absolutely correct
1488279 i say in my book that writing songs with people is like falling in love over and over again but obviously you dont go falling in love with everybody its this thing that theres sort of an instant chemical reaction and you say i know i can write a great song with this person its like a feeling some people i just know im not really a gun for hire songwriter all these songs came about by being in extraordinary circumstances or meeting somebody and getting along and having an acoustic guitar
1488280 thanks so much on toms version there was a drum machine most of the way through and a sitar guitar but this version its the whole band playing and im playing the same sitar guitar but obviously ive got an english voice
1488281 its funny you are absolutely spot on there when of the guys who started mtv he did actually tell me that he saw eurythmics play and do that well before unplugged and also u2 i think it was the beginning of unplugged
1488282 what happened was that when eurythmics became so huge and annie being such a private person it was always very scary for her to start any eurythmics project because it would snowball into the whole roller coaster so we had many ideas like lets play opera houses wed have all sorts of ideas and tell people but we would never end up doing it we often thought about me just on a guitar and some strings and just annie there were endless combinations
1488283 i think its to do with personality and being able to maintain some semblance of stability in your life its very hard balancing being an artist and other things that happen in your life marriages families kids some people manage to do it and some manage lots of complex situations and still keep their creativity alive but then others get buried under it all and they could swallowed up before they know it and some people stick to formula and they stop experimenting they think theyve struck gold here and were going to play the same thing for five years
1488284 no we would have been categorized as the electro era
1488285 i think it was the videos our visual assault and that we played america so much
1488286 yeah we were really experimenting we were on stage with sam from sam and dave singing wrap it up we thought we could do anything
1488287 yeah we could really we would go on stage and nobody would know what was about to happen
1488288 this album is made up of 21 songs that have huge stories to them and then there will be another 21 songs obviously annie and i wrote over 100 songs just ourselves you know the morrisonhotel galleries they sort of specialize in photographic exhibitions and theyve given my an exibition on sept 17 th for photos from this book and thats really amazing timing because on the 18 th im playing the fillmore
1488289 i must have been hit by lightning on my head or something when i was kid i had all these little radios they had a little thing you put in your ear and i remember when i was little i put into my ear and plugged it in the electric socket and my head went zapppppp
1488290 they like to play me stuff but they like to have their own opinions
1488291 well there is a great archive in the sky now isnt there sometimes my son will say to me hey dad you should hear this song have you ever heard of this guy lou reed and im like yeah but theyre just discovering him and albums that theyve discovered its like the whole thing starts again
1488292 they are always very critical but they are very supportive at the same time they like to say thats really cool or i like this other one better theyve got their own tastes you know
1488293 they recognize that we were a powerhouse and theyve seen us on stage on the peacetour and i think they were like wow
1488294 i was with them and they were really excited about it and they were gobsmacked because none of our kids had actually ever seen annie perform so the first time when they went out front to see it they were like holy shit
1488295 i dont know i would hope so i think weve played enough and made enough records and created enough stuff to at least merit a nomination or whatever two years ago we were inducted into the hall of fame in britain by bob geldolf sting and the prime minister
1488296 not really i knew tony blair for years before he was prime minister ive had many interesting turns in my life where lots of different people have been around and tony blair just happened to be one of them he would be there at the same dinner with robert altman he genuinely meant what he said
1488297 bmg couldnt get virgin to agree to put it amongst it all i would like to dig into the 1984 vault and find all the tracks we left off there was a lot of amazing experimental stuff
1488298 there are some amazing fan sites eurythmics me uk and hes compiling just about everything and he has another friend who has a site called dnafiles and between them i think theyre trying to get everything and they can have a link to it all
1488299 im launching a whole sort of collection of everything from clothes to guitars everything in a sort of rock fabulous lifestyle a launch of all that is in las vegas aug 25 but right now well im lying flat on my back right now
1488300 well me and this lady tabatha are here with our eyes falling out of our head from checking and proofreading the book and making sure the photos are the correct quality ive never toured america as dave stewart and people will ask what is it all i can say is it will be an enormous spectacle where the audience will recognize every song one after another i really look as myself as a sort of cab calloway type character ive created my band you know the period when the bandleaders were the stars so ive created this epic thing and im going to lead it into the throw as they say in britain im going to create this spectacle and give the audience a sort of musical journey weve had costumes made for the orchestra and everything to look at it will be amazing and to look at it be amazing and sort of amazing in a way

1488316 what is the best religion on the planet which one is right
1488317 no doubt soaring cathedrals stirring music moving stories and parables help a bit but by far the most important variable determining your religion is the accident of birth

1488320 you hear people say our universe is fine tuned for life that stars are rare and couldnt form if certain things were different
1488321 the right way to do the problem is to start from scratch
1488322 you have to turn all the knobs and find out what happens
1488323 you can change alpha or the gravitational constant by a factor of 100 and stars still form
1488324 you have no idea what life would be like in a universe with different constants
1488325 ive long had a suspicion that this talk of fine tuning needs constant questioning and re examination
1488326 its sometimes hard to recognise that living somewhere else in a different way might be just as easy
1488327 a mans ethical behavior should be based effectually on sympathy education and social ties no religious basis is necessary man would indeed be in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of reward after death

1488329 scientific truth is too beautiful to be sacrificed for the sake of light entertainment or money astrology is an aesthetic affront it cheapens astronomy like using beethoven for commercial jingles

1488333 science offers us an explanation of how complexity the difficult arose out of simplicity the easy the hypothesis of god offers no worthwhile explanation for anything for it simply postulates what we are trying to explain
1488334 what can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof
1488335 it has become almost a clich to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science
1488336 a lot of that can be contributed to new motorcycle drivers get a little brave behind those handle bars
1488337 what they dont realize is that even a crash at 30 mph can be fatal
1488338 the one way that we can keep our hand in the fight is that we transition to a future weapons system and thats the mq 9 weapons system
1488339 the airplane is a very symbolic thing because you can go out there you can touch it you can see it you can watch it
1488340 when we move from the f 16 to the mq 9 theres really going to be a generational change in mentalities there wont be mq 9s flying out of syracuse international airport every day so there wont be the noise there wont be the visual or physical presence of the aircraft anymore
1488341 the skills are transferable in the sense that you have to lean forward and you need to have an open mind
1488342 thats an enlisted position and theres no equivalent job in the 174th fw today that clearly realigns to that mission
1488343 once this mq 9 package is up and running well be doing deployed operations
1488344 there will still be a subset of people who go down range to launch and maintain this system but its a significant footprint shrinkage
1488345 it will be a sad day when the last f 16 departs hancock field because with it will be many memories and some top notch maintainers
1488346 but in the air national guard our survival dictates that we remain flexible and open to change so if it requires us to take on a uas mission for the unit to flourish and provide a future for the next generation of 174th fw members then lets roll
1488347 most everybody has other jobs that theyre leaving at home being in the guard
1488348 everybody wants to contribute to the cause so its pretty exciting for us to come out here as our final f 16 deployment and to really be at the tip of the spear
1488349 i would be nowhere else in the world than right here right now this is the place this is where we have to be this is what we need to be here to do
1488350 we are working to provide them with the additional forces they would like there is a concerted effort by this building to figure out what more can be done and as the secretary said he would like it done sooner rather than later
1488351 at some point soon hes going to make a recommendation to the secretary and to the president on the possibility of further troop drawdowns
1488352 i know much has been made of sort of the correlation between forces coming down in iraq and going up in afghanistan
1488353 and while that certainly would seem to be the most natural transaction to take place the truth is were nearly 2 5 million strong around the world we have the means to draw forces elsewhere whether it be through reserves or national guard or drawing down from other places around the world where we have commitments
1488354 we have first commitments across the globe and threats and contingencies we need to be situated for beyond just the wars in iraq and afghanistan

1488395 the asia managers said what can we do with customers i said you can take them to the games or you could just show them the
1488396 we dont have funds to be big sponsor of the olympics but i love baseball and its a charming story of a start up team i thought it was a thing we could support and feel were a small small part of the olympics
1488397 lets put it this way at this point you know you have a really good team when your reserves are helping you win as many games as your starters i dont want to say too much were all very excited

1488408 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1488409 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1488410 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1488411 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1488412 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1488413 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1488414 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1488415 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1488416 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1488417 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1488418 it just kept pulling us out we just kept getting hit by waves and sucked it was a whooshing feeling of being just dragged out
1488419 i didnt even think about it i heard screaming and the next thing i knew i was in the water
1488420 it just happened so quick i couldnt even tell you
1488421 what the amazing thing to me is what theyve talked about in terms of their feelings when they were in the water
1488422 and how so little of it was self centered most of it was about what we would feel what i would feel if i lost two daughters what their sons would feel
1488423 joel and rich basically made the fact that im even standing here possible autumn and i both really believed that we werent ever gonna be standing on this earth again we really felt that after a certain period of time even though i couldnt see autumn clearly i could still kind of hear her and see her head and i think we both realized at one point that this was gonna be it that we werent gonna come back
1488424 it was 20 minutes where they went through this whole thing and they didnt know and we were up watching and wondering what was happening and unable to help but thank god joel came down and rich that was what saved the whole day
1488425 its an extraordinary thing to know somebodys life was in your hands and that youre their last chance its really something i never want to feel again
1488426 we were so glad to have a happy ending to let you know about you know because so much many times we dont have that kind of happy ending

1488431 many people have had questions in their mind about why and how the decisions were made that got made i dont discount any of them ive had those same questions in my mind many many times but its clear to me that congress is not going to act on any of this they arent acting on anything at all
1488432 moving forward and fixing the mistakes of the last eight years
1488433 thats lawlessness being ratified by this congress if thats how theyre going forward theyre going in the wrong direction

1488435 we asked him a question what do you want to do and the first thing he said was i want to run for the united states in the olympics in 2008
1488436 his stated dream was to run in the olympics and now that hes made the team everything from this point is gravy
1488437 im anxious to see him at opening ceremonies when he goes into the birds nest stadium over 90 000 people and hes walking with all those other elite athletes from so many countries thats going to be an exciting event for him
1488438 i told lopez i know his roots are in africa his roots are in sudan but your trunk of your tree is here in tully in central new york thats where you got your strength and the main part of your focus

1488459 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1488460 it highlights the efforts for the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1488461 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costrel results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1488462 these prosecutions demonstrate that through coordinated commitment the united states secret service and the department of justice will penetrate and prosecute

1488495 you think you know someone and believe they are your friend
1488496 live fast die young and leave a flesh eating corpse
1488497 is that the kind of language to be using in this classroom
1488498 disrupting the class is one thing but the real problem here is your cursing amy i would like you to go to the principals office immediately and he can decide what to do with you you can clean up your papers later now class all eyes on me
1488499 i said a swear word and mrs wilkens got upset
1488500 and she has every reason to be upset cursing is not tolerated especially for our students as young as you are and especially when it is screamed in front of a class as you apparently had to have done tell me amy which word was it
1488501 amy im going to have to teach you your lesson like i said this cannot and will not be tolerated and i am going to have to punish you swearing in general is bad but it is a thousand times worse when you say a bad word in front of a classroom of children do you understand
1488502 you are mature enough to know not to use such words in the school then arent you since that is the case i will have to give you a mature punishment nothing like writing i will not swear 1 000 times on a piece of paper or anything like that but dont worry ill go easy on you since this is your first offense
1488503 you heard me amy do you want me to have to call home and tell your parents about all of this or can we just get your punishment over in ten minutes in this very room and nothing more
1488504 its not that bad amy if you let me finish nothing will happen you wont be in trouble and if you ever get sent to my office for doing anything bad again in the next few years youre at this high school i will just send you away besides amy you have cute pink bikini panties
1488505 pull your skirt off and lay it on the floor

1488520 i could do it if you dont but i think it would be more enjoyable if you did and if you dont well theres always the rope and i can tie you down and do much worse to you and you wont even have a say

1488526 its okay i can warm up a tv dinner or something
1488527 im going to let you go youre going to return to pizza plaza with my pizza and say that you got lost with the delivery if you tell them the truth they will not believe because theyve already looked around the house and they believed my story can you never tell anyone that this happened lynne

1488576 b reaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy this transformation will be costly and given the fiscal disaster we will inherit from the last administration it will likely require us to defer some other priorities
1488577 well also invest federal resources including tax incentives and government contracts into developing next generation biofuels
1488578 in addition well find safer ways to use nuclear power and store nuclear waste we already lead the world with 104 nuclear power plants and well invest in the technology that will allow us to use more coal
1488579 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country
1488580 this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of
1488581 any time you pick up a newspaper and see the terms climate change or global warming just think jobs for michigan
1488582 believe me the production people can do it if they really try
1488583 the two methods of renting a dvd are only substantively different at the very end when the disc travels to your doorstep the netflix dvd may be transported back and forth over much greater distances than the one from the local video store but its part of a much larger delivery in the back of a mail truck and that reduces its environmental impact
1488584 even just a two mile drive to the video store will consume a few hundred times more energy than the netflix delivery from a distribution center 200 miles away
1488585 packaging accounts for another chunk of the difference between renting online or from the video store it takes a significant amount of energy to make the lockable polypropylene case that you might get at a video store
1488586 so remember its not just how far something travels that matters its the route it takes to get there

1488592 prior studies have looked at atrial fibrillation in young and middle aged and generally healthy people
1488593 they found that for example marathon runners have a higher risk of atrial fibrillation but the vast majority of atrial fibrillation occurs later in life after 65 about one in five people develops atrial fibrillation over 10 years
1488594 no one has looked at exercise and atrial fibrillation in these older people
1488595 we found that light to moderate exercise such as walking 10 blocks a week was associated with a lower incidence of atrial fibrillation

1488607 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1488608 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1488609 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1488610 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1488611 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17
1488612 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort

1488620 what our own government was trying to plan and that was to find a reason for bombing iran
1488621 unsolicited advice to the government of iran presuming that you are not actually ignorant enough to desire war with the united states you might be well advised to read the history of the sinking of the u s s maine in havana harbor in 1898 and the history of the gulf of tonkin in 1964 having done so you will surely recognize that americans are reluctant to go to war unless attacked until pearl harbor we were even reluctant to get involved in world war ii for historians of american wars the question is whether we provoke provocations given the unilateral u s invasion of iraq in 2003 you are obviously thinking the rules have changed provocation is no longer required to take america to war but even in this instance we were led to believe that the mass murderer of american civilians osama bin laden was lurking literally or figuratively in the vicinity of baghdad given all this you would probably be well advised to keep your forces including clandestine forces as far away from the iraqi border as you can you might even consider bringing in some neighbors to verify that you are not shipping arms next door tone down the rhetoric on zionism youve established your credentials with those in your world who thrive on that if it makes you feel powerful to hurl accusations at the american eagle have at it sticks and stones etc but for the next sixteen months or so you should not only not take provocative actions you should not seem to be doing so for the vast majority of americans who seek no wider war in the middle east or elsewhere dont tempt fate dont give a certain vice president we know the justification he is seeking to attack your country that is unless you happen to like having bombs fall on your head
1488622 there may still be very great delays and disappointments before it becomes an efficient and beneficent world system countless people from maharajas to millionaires and from pukkha sahibs to pretty ladies will hate the new world order be rendered unhappy by frustration of their passions and ambitions through its advent and will die protesting against it when we attempt to estimate its promise we have to bear in mind the distress of a generation or so of malcontents many of them quite gallant and graceful looking people
1488623 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and it will be a major focus this season
1488624 we are committed to improving the fan experience in every way we can from the time fans arrive in the parking lot to when they depart the stadium
1488625 more research is needed as to why these types of fish may have protective effects but the omega 3 fatty acids epa and dha would seem to have a major role
1488626 previous findings have shown that fish and fish oil can help prevent stroke but this is one of the only studies that looks at the effect of fish on silent brain infarcts in healthy older people
1488627 we have no affiliation with the field of science i think were as happy about that as the field of science is
1488628 i listened to music when i was younger but it wasnt really a passion for me i wouldnt say
1488629 i didnt play any instruments until we started this band
1488630 i think our style of music is more mainstream in the uk
1488631 beyond that i think its just a bit of a crapshoot i would say really i think theres work involved in success anywhere in music i mean for us things started to take off in the uk so we really just pushed it we toured there really consistently for almost the entire first year and sort of neglected the us where things didnt take off as quickly i dont know i think the uk gave us the initial spark combined with our willingness to apply a solid year of hard work to seal the deal here weve just never really felt that weve been in the same position
1488632 certainly i think our lyrics usually tend to deal with interpersonal relationships often romantic but not always thats really what every songs pretty much about its not the same incidents being retread over and over again but theres that theme
1488633 i think its a label that to be honest that we have sort of secretly fostered its little more than a marketing angle really were more the sort of jock frat boy type dudes but i think that doesnt fly very well in indie rock its not really what the fans are looking for so as the band started to take off we sort of finessed it tossed on some glasses dropped about 50 pounds of muscle and beefed up our vocabularies a little bit
1488634 youve never felt manual vertigo till youve held your hands out there over the basin of the sink in the public toilet at the ekko in utrecht
1488635 my mustache were it a sandwich would be a club
1488636 i think it changes the way people digest the art if they know something about the creator
1488637 i dont think its necessarily better i dont know if its even good its certainly different but i think that any art thats published one should be able to appreciate it without any knowledge of the author or creator in the case of pop music it does feel like theres a strong urge for people to know something about the musicians but i guess its unlike painting for example music involves performance as well as composition so it stands to reason that the personalities of these people onstage who are performing live for you have an image and voice youre familiar with i dont know music is a weird situation i kind of think that in a painter or a dancer or in literature the artist should be irrelevant thats not to say that we arent curious about them but i guess in music theres something inherently legitimate about the inquiries of the artists
1488638 they can expect a lot of magic tricks and i dont mean that in a glorified way
1488639 i just mean that we literally do a lot of card tricks and coin tricks onstage which not everybody does thats a trick we picked up from jimmy buffet actually a rather unlikely source for an indie rock band but it worked for him and frankly it works for us theyre going to see a lot of synchronized dance which is a tradition that goes back to the golden era of musicals and cinema and also vaudeville

1488648 the continuing downward trend in consumer confidence is not surprising given the recent batch of poor economic data

1488664 the mhra is keen to support the availability of more medicines over the counter where it is safe to do so and we wish to move on to new areas such as prevention and chronic disease management
1488665 we know many pharmacists are ready for this too making this medicine available from a pharmacy is a real example of how we are progressing and enabling people to play an active role in taking charge of their own healthcare
1488666 well lemme just see what this lil chick over here is all about
1488667 finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life but it does make us reassess how we think about life on mars
1488668 because different types of perchlorate salts have interesting properties that may bear on the way things work on mars if the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of mars or at least a significant portion of the planet
1488669 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1488670 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars
1488671 right now we dont know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad news for possible life on mars
1488672 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1488673 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates
1488674 we need to focus on preventing domestic violence but the government has largely ignored preventative work and instead has passed more criminal justice legislation and even this hasnt been implemented properly
1488675 why have they still not implemented the domestic violence restraining orders that were promised four years ago this labour government is letting down domestic violence victims
1488676 two women are killed every week by a current or former partner this is a huge statistic and one that we need to start addressing and addressing fast if were to save lives and protect young women in the future
1488677 it is essential that women receive the right education and information so they can understand the techniques of control frequently used by abusive men
1488678 its all too easy for women to excuse their partners possessive and jealous behaviour but in so doing they run the risk of the abuse increasing in frequency and severity over time by understanding the signs early a woman is forewarned and forearmed

1488685 synaptic hosting is at amp ts brand around their vmware based managed hosting platform it is to a large extent a repackaging and rebranding of the virtualization capabilities they acquired when they bought usi
1488686 its a nice platform and its what we expect out of a strong competitor in the hosting space but it is neither first to market nor exceptionally innovative it is simply a competitive offering
1488687 the synaptic hosting platform is similar to other such platforms such as terremarks infinistructure 2005 or savvis virtual intelligent hosting 2007
1488688 it is closest in capabilities to the savvis platform but at amp t has done a better job of integrating in related services such as security by bundling rather than selling them piecemeal as savvis does
1488689 the platform can scale up an individual instance from 1 core 2 gb ram random access memory to 2 cores 4 gb ram but cannot scale further either vertically or horizontally without human intervention manual provisioning intervals are measured in days not hours or minutes this is comparable to savvis but not to terremark whose enterprise cloud platform can scale arbitrarily with self provisioning and provisioning intervals measured in minutes just long enough for a data copy
1488690 many companies see the cloud as a place to host infrastructure utilities we see the cloud as a broader representation of the need to deliver services to individuals and companies over the internet this will include infrastructure as a core necessity
1488691 this is key at amp t has the challenge of actually delivering service well it is one thing for a telecommunications provider to deliver voice or data but quite another to deliver infrastructure services to those used to relying on data centers at amp ts internet data centers are also right in line with what others are doing on this front and we expect this trend to continue
1488692 were still somewhere between the bleeding edge and early adopter market adoption stage it will take years for developers to move mainstream custom application development to these on demand highly virtualized architectures
1488693 at amp t like many telcos must find a way to remain relevant to customers and to expend its relevancy to businesses as the internet and use of internet delivered services like iptv internet protocol tv and voip voice over internet protocol continue to erode telco uniqueness in order to prevent themselves from just becoming the pipe through which everyone travels they have to up the ante
1488694 google app engine is similar in concept what i think were actually seeing is a move toward web centric application platforms which will make providing addressable services to developers a key to success this is where i think amazon and google have an early edge
1488695 bitten off more than it can chew in this circumstance
1488696 the advertisers are going to have to come to the table and say we have a solution for this
1488697 they have to tell the cable companies youve got the boxes
1488698 the set top box is really a significant capital cost for all the cable operators
1488699 any solution that you could propose to them that gives them that dvr functionality right now is music to their ears
1488700 cable companies are already in a situation where theyre looking at hd high definition and expanding hd channels im wondering how much bandwidth they really have at their disposal and wondering what the implications are long term if this technology takes off
1488701 theyve gone this far whats another 10 million in legal fees
1488702 theres always the possibility the supreme court will look at it and have a different perspective but i think ultimately the appellate court was pretty forceful in overturning the district courts ruling
1488703 a lot of people didnt buy dvrs for cost reasons or complexity but in the end the leading edge of consumers they do buy these devices and their experiences on the internet are showing that they are expecting a greater level of control over their media
1488704 a hardware abstraction layer hal is an abstraction layer implemented in software between the physical hardware of a computer and the software that runs on that computer its function is to hide differences in hardware from most of the operating system kernel so that most of the kernel mode code does not need to be changed to run on systems with different hardware on a pc hal can basically be considered to be the driver for the motherboard and allows instructions from higher level computer languages to communicate with lower level components such as directly with hardware
1488705 we believe that itll present a very compelling alternative and bring openness to the world of small business which has not historically been true
1488706 the client side of the it environment is one the last bastions of proprietary technology it has been disproportionately dominated by one vendor
1488707 i can hardly name an area where we need more choice
1488708 to protect our mutual customers by providing advance information about upcoming security releases this enables security software providers to protect customers more quickly against possible attacks
1488709 by receiving vulnerability information earlier customers benefit from additional possible improvements that provide security protection such as third party intrusion detection systems intrusion prevention systems or security software signatures microsoft continues to recommend that customers deploy security updates to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities
1488710 it takes a lot of trust to release this very inside information you have to be careful who you let that out to this really shows the maturity of the security industry its come a long way from the time when vendors would find flaws and make them public as a publicity stunt or to get a lot of coverage or press those days are largely past and microsofts trust in the security industry is highlighted by this move
1488711 the success of mapp will depend on the quality of the information provided by microsoft and the various security software vendors response
1488712 itd be an even bigger advantage for hackers as it is already a footrace between the security organizations and these malicious code writers its down to hours on patch tuesday you can imagine a week head start for a hacker would be very bad
1488713 it is important that information is not leaked to hackers but this is by no means the first program that microsoft has set up that shares information with other vendors they have plenty of experience setting up agreements regarding data confidentiality and probably have those agreements in place already as part of other microsoft security initiatives

1488719 its an election year which is basically christmas for stand up comics and i figured i should get my ass on the road while the shrub is still in office a lot has happened in the world and in my life since i last did this six years ago and theres no better thrill and no better therapy than getting on that high wire in front of a live audience

1488768 rortys critics on the left take issue with his call for american national pride in part because they confuse nationalism as such with recent episodes of ethnic cleansing in part because they believe that the erasure of the difference between american national pride and missionary faith in a gunfighter nation cause the vietnam war
1488769 but the value of rortys argument does not lie in the particular way he narrates the history of the left it lies instead in his attempt to connect the left to the history of the united states and thus to rid us of the idea that either is exempt from the corruptions of historical time or power i would now add
1488770 he is claiming that intellectuals on the left cannot realistically project their potential constituents into a better future without some knowledge of and respect for the many pasts of their fellow citizens
1488771 so he is reminding us of what john dewey said in his first major work outlines of a critical theory of ethics 1891 an

1488777 public sphere was marked by gender and class exclusions this is why habermas calls it the
1488778 women were patently excluded from the bourgeois public sphere that ideal historical type that habermas traced to the eighteenth century and were even read out of the fiction of the public by virtue of their ideological consignment to a separate realm called the private
1488779 the public sphere in the world of letters was replaced by the pseudo public or sham private world of culture consumption

1488781 i have run away catch me if you take me back to my master zoninus youll be rewarded
1488782 what counsel then have i to offer i think we should do what our ancestors did in a war that was much less serious than this one when they were forced into their strongholds by the cimbri and teutoni and overcome like us by famine instead of surrendering they kept themselves alive by eating the flesh of those who were too old or too young to fight even if we had no precedent for such action i think that when our liberty is at stake it would be a noble example to set to our descendents for this is a life and death struggle quite unlike the war with the cimbri who though they devastated gaul and grievously afflicted her did eventually evacuate our country and migrate elsewhere and left us free men to live on our own land under our own laws and in possession of our rights the romans we know have a very different purpose envy is the motive that inspires them they know that we have won renown by our military strength and so they mean to install themselves in our lands and our towns and fasten the yoke of slavery on us for ever that is how they have always treated conquered enemies you do not know much perhaps of the condition of distant peoples but you need only look at that part of gaul on your own borders that has been made into a roman province with new laws and institutions imposed upon it ground beneath the conquerors iron heel in perpetual servitude

1488792 i battled an ancient gorgon to a standstill ive defeated hades himself im a warrior with vast experience leading amazons in battle as well as a scientist and ambassador fluent in most of the earths languages im an ex demigoddess who embodies the principles of truth love and peace
1488793 yes she has led vast armies of superpowered amazons and saved the earth multiple times but i simply dont picture her as a commander in chief can you she just doesnt seem you know very tough shes always on about peace and understanding ha ha ha
1488794 nothing to do with that at all ha ha ha in these times we just need someone tougher than a hot babe blessed with the strength of the earth itself notwithstanding that we wish her all the best ha ha ha
1488795 truth peace love she has no credibility none ever since she murdered maxwell lord oh i know she says she was saving the earth from certain doom yada yada yada but really
1488796 this is the united states not some crackpot little utopia
1488797 how convenient now that governor thor has started to explore a run that she suddenly starts talking about her
1488798 her ideas are amazing i mean shes a master of all known human philosophy ancient and modern but the press just wants to talk about her clothes
1488799 how many articles will we read about her star spangled granny panties look at the way the press treats speaker black canary senator superman prances around in tights and no one says a word but let a woman show up for work in fishnet stockings and a black bustier and all anyone can talk about is her appearance its ridiculous
1488800 hes young and charming and from the midwest hes inspirational has old timey values and the smile the abs of steel literally
1488801 i think he could be this generations captain america i really do
1488802 look i know that senator kent has saved the world from certain doom and found a cure for cancer i realize that he has the power to turn the earth backwards on its axis and revive the dead but the south will never accept him hes an illegal alien literally i mean when you arrive by meteor you dont go through ins you know the republicans are going to make out that hes really just here freeloading on our healthcare system
1488803 but i just dont know if americans can get past his funny name
1488804 he was up against the joker the friggin joker and he blew it hes just too cold too distant and too darn rich let him stay up at wayne manor and experiment with his little devices to save the world he aint gettin my vote no way
1488805 oh come on nightwing he tries to step out of batmans shadow and reinvents himself as nightwing lame lame lame hes the same old robin lite spoiled rich boy trying to relate to the ordinary man on the gotham street fake fake fake
1488806 i think that a freakishly strong green giant wearing ridiculously tiny purple pants is exactly what america needed in 2004 and its what we need today
1488807 its not just a chemical reaction caused by government passion
1488808 lets just say it unmarried dominatrix it will never play in the heartland although i personally love it her long leather clad legs her cruelly spiked boots the way she flicks the whip just so uh i gotta go
1488809 frankly we do have candidates weve just been feeding them one by one to the great cthulhu as one of the great old ones he has designs on devouring every single human he encounters thats a narrative that really resonates with our base destruction raw power devouring worlds what can i say he polls well
1488810 its a long shot admittedly hes single and a marginally employed construction worker but as i was going over the disgruntlement with our current slate i kept thinking what do they want the friggin son of god and then i thought hell yes
1488811 if you want to drive performance management deeper into an organization you have to be able to serve a diverse user base
1488812 views 8 lets users at all levels bring measures into a preferred interface
1488813 our old reporting technology was inflexible there were just 18 reports and they werent extendable by end users
1488814 with views 8 we supply a suite of standard reports that can live in a users favorite interface using birt and e spreadsheets users can extend the base reports with any number of additional metrics
1488815 it was possible to do this before with views but it required lots of work
1488816 a single platform that can be deployed across every business process rather than being a niche application
1488817 even if you participate in multiple business processes you wont have to learn multiple interfaces
1488818 bill has been integral to growing the microsoft business intelligence bi business from a small startup within the sql server product group to the thriving core business it is today as can be evidenced by microsofts position as a leader in the gartner bi platform magic quadrant bill has lent his strong leadership and vision to products in their early days such as sql server microsoft office performancepoint server 2007 and most recently to the master data management team

1488821 im appalled by what appears to be blatant and widespread violations of iowas child labor laws at agriprocessors

1488824 you never can push them as far as they can go the reality of the peak performance of the console is yes you could look to a generation beyond where we are now and think yeah i could use that power but the reality is in 360 and the ps3 and the latest generation pc graphics the amount of power in the gpus is such that youre more bound by your creativity and the aesthetic youre going for than youre really bound by polygon pushing power
1488825 youre probably actually more bound maybe by art authoring and the amount of data throughput that just the amount of memory youd need but i dont think 360 has reached its limit
1488826 if you see some of the stuff weve done in fact some of the stuff our guys have done the gpu particle systems and things like some of our guys have been working on the geometric style real time radiosity
1488827 even at the start of this generation if youd said to me without actually me just looking at it and you were asking me off the cuff as a graphics programmer could that happen id have said no and then you think well whats going to come next you can still keep pushing it and pushing it and pushing it
1488828 there is no longer a reason to buy a ps3

1489039 a passe mieux aupr s des usagers si on dit une raison on est moins emmerd
1489040 asian americans and pacific islanders have historically been invisible in the eyes of government too often forgotten even as an afterthought
1489041 with this platform we want to declare the existence of the asian american community to the democratic party
1489042 we had only 97 lines for the call and they all filled up quickly this demonstrates two things first it shows how interested apis are in getting involved secondly it demonstrates that people want to engage in issues when the democrats do more than just go to people and say help us get elected when they actually ask people to discuss and debate issues it opens up a whole new universe
1489043 out of all the ethnic groups the api community is the most economically polarized you have really rich asians on one end and really poor asians on the other unfortunately when politicians try and engage us on issues they go to the wealthy asian businessman or the asian elected official consequently the voices of the asian american working class get left out this is the first time a democratic presidential candidate is asking for the opinions of the api non profit and community organizations
1489044 michael is the top staff person on the platform committee working directly with committee chair gov janet napolitano with over 1 000 platform meetings going on throughout the country it was a privilege for him to join us and great to hear him praise our efforts to focus on api issues
1489045 instead of an 8 page document that looks like it could have been written by any progressive organization or minority advocacy group why wasnt there more of a focus on just a handful of api issues that affects our community more directly
1489046 if what we submit to the obama campaign is too narrowly focused on just asian issues it may not make it onto the platform
1489047 there is an api perspective to all of the issues we outlined
1489048 for example with immigration reform the laws that govern how asians abroad can reunite with their families in america remain very unique and tend to differ from other groups like the cuban and haitan communities a lot of groups face cultural and linguistic barriers but they are not all identical still apis are human beings and there few things that just affect us a lot of things are universal
1489049 this differs greatly from hillary clintons microtrends approach which attempts to reduce different minority groups into special interest categories
1489050 but the platform is merely the first step for the api community
1489051 it will take a lot more organizing and direct involvement to break the barrier of invisibility

1489059 un trastorno de personalidad que no encaja en ning n subapartado espec fico
1489060 cl nicamente hablando cualquier persona socialmente disfuncional que se siente autorizada a usar su poder para controlar a otras personas por las que se siente amenazada o que vive una fantas a pretenciosa en lugar de en la realidad y que se ve a s misma consistentemente como superior a sus compa eros y anhela ser reconocido como tal re ne los requisitos del denominado trastorno narcisista de la personalidad
1489061 es posible reunir a un considerable n mero de gente en amor mutuo siempre que haya otra gente dejada fuera para recibir las manifestaciones de su agresividad
1489062 el narcisismo colectivo es una de las fuentes m s importantes de agresi n humana y sin embargo como todas las dem s formas de agresi n defensiva es reacci n a un ataque contra intereses vitales difiere de otras formas de agresi n defensiva en que el narcisismo intenso en s es un fen meno semipatol gico considerando las causas y la funci n de sangrientas y crueles matanzas en masa como las ocurridas entre hind es y musulmanes en el momento de la partici n de la india o recientemente entre los musulmanes bengal es y sus gobernantes paquistan es vemos que el narcisismo colectivo desempe a ciertamente un papel considerable cosa nada sorprendente si tomamos en cuenta que nos las habemos con las poblaciones virtualmente m s pobres y miserables del mundo entero

1489260 they were able to bring the baby out of the flat and he was subsequently attended to by the ambulance service

1489283 mas n o podemos ter panes mentais durante a olimp ada porque podemos dar possibilidade para os advers rios encostarem
1489284 no terceiro quarto eles conseguiram bons arremessos e isso os trouxe de volta para o jogo precisamos entender que isso pode acontecer e importante seguir firme em quadra

1489352 senate debate at farmfest it turns out is clearly held in coleman country
1489353 in response to a question from an ag journalist about energy independence franken said norm coleman is in the pocket of big oil hes received more contributions from big oil than any politician in the history of minnesota
1489354 but of course most of the attention was focused on coleman and franken coleman was clearly the favorite of the crowd which did not appear to care for frankens contempt of the senator even so franken kept blasting
1489355 franken falters at farmfest on relief from gas prices comedians deception on drilling no joke
1489356 al franken proved today that there isnt anything he wont say in order to win this election in between the constant barrage of negative attacks at farmfest franken continued his campaign of deception by implying he supports offshore drilling the record is clear while minnesota families are hurting al franken continues to stand in the way of relief
1489357 generally however democrats are more inclined to emphasize conservation over drilling in restricted areas and argue that oil companies have failed to drill where its already permitted u s senate candidate al franken a dfler makes that argument in opposing drilling or mining in any of the restricted areas
1489358 drill more now pay less at the pump not so fast
1489359 i dont think the solution is drilling the 2 of the reserves that exist in the world
1489360 do you think that there is anything in that policy allowing more drilling that would bring the price of gasoline down below 4 if we allowed that
1489361 franken falters at farmfest on relief from gas prices comedians deception on drilling no joke
1489362 senate debate at farmfest it turns out is clearly held in coleman country

1489370 they are so comfortable with technology and multimedia that you have to catch up with them and engage them on that level or they will be bored
1489371 you have to bridge the gap between how we learnt and how they learn
1489372 one simple example through the use of individual pdas a teacher could ask any question any time during her lesson and get real time feedback of what each student has understood
1489373 it is a frightening thought but one that also shows the potential of that technology
1489374 a gap continues to exist between familiarity with ict and translating this into effective teaching
1489375 the worst thing is to have teachers just come in and use a smart board as an overhead projector and not use any of its interactive applications to enhance students learning
1489376 you have to get them to see the rationale behind using ict
1489377 i set up blogs to showcase my students art work and told the parents about it and they really enjoy it they can comment on the pieces and communicate with their kids with ict its easier to involve parents
1489378 should be remodelled as a heritage centre because of the indian neighbourhood the verge sounds good but it is out of place here
1489379 we thought the question and answer aspect of messaging really lends itself to teaching because students can ask questions and get answers quickly
1489380 i cant be there 24 7 for a student but newton is there whenever students log in
1489381 you might feel embarrassed to ask a question in front of the whole class because you dont want to feel stupid and slow the class down
1489382 but you can ask newton something over and over again until you fully understand it
1489383 i am not a bad man i still love my wife very much
1489384 no she must die she must not live i must kill her
1489385 we can see clearly that these forces are trying to wage a psychological and violent battle against the olympics
1489386 they want to turn the year of 2008 into a year of mourning for china
1489387 i like hsm because its a simple fun thing to watch with hsm its all in front of me in song and dance i am lazy to imagine how life can be perfect and uncomplicated
1489388 i love the songs i know all the lyrics by heart because they are so catchy
1489389 its amazing the parents are watching the movie every day with their kids over and over again
1489390 when they bring their kids to the show we realised that they know the songs better than the kids they sing along as well
1489391 we used all the moves from the actual movie and had chucky klapow who was the choreographer for both movies work very closely with cindy stuart the ice skating choreographer to translate it perfectly onto the ice
1489392 doing the show on ice added a whole new dynamic to it in the movie everything is in one spot on the ice you can add speed and power behind it it makes it more thrilling
1489393 its a big responsibility to play our characters because everybody knows what they are like and how they behave on screen
1489394 you have to know it better than you know yourself they are after all characters that so many fans know inside out and love
1489395 to ensure there is no abuse of power because we all want free and fair elections
1489396 abdullah met with umno leaders through jasa in kuala lumpur and gave them money and kain pelikat sarong or batik while providing them with four star hotel accommodation as well as entertainment
1489397 the content of their speeches clearly reflected abuse of power and were intended at persuading division leaders to support their party positions
1489398 of course it the ioc rule 45 can be challenged
1489399 the government recognises the role of the father as well you probably will see some changes where we will allow some discretion between the father and the mother to share childcare arrangements
1489400 all the days of leave can add up against women
1489401 i was worried that compared to another male manager i did less
1489402 thats why i can be a ceo of a company
1489403 so while we recognise women have more demands we should pause and consider the implications of the demands
1489404 the competition is so good in the 100 and 50m free that anyone from 10 to 12 guys can win the event me making the semi finals and final is no guarantee i can tell you that
1489405 we actually dont mind things like answering questions and meeting the fans it helps us prepare mentally for the competition
1489406 its good that shes got one record and i have one we will push each other and i look forward to racing her
1489407 we are very happy to receive this piece of news all the hard work dedication and determination by the ren ci team over the past months have been fruitful
1489408 i am trying to go and get some gold at beijing that is my goal
1489409 im not making any predictions for the olympics im just going to do whatever helps the team
1489410 it just felt like i had a hard day in the training room
1489411 i didnt let it bother me i just blocked it out i just went after it like every other championship
1489412 if you are able to win at the trials you are able to win in the olympics
1489413 the college championships really helped my confidence showed that i had my speed back
1489414 ive been working on my starts staying low driving out and it seems to help
1489415 you have to be a pretty elite athlete to be in the same company with michael jordan lebron james and tiger woods
1489416 i wasnt training or anything and i got seventh that says a lot to me
1489417 my goal is to medal in beijing and bring home the hardware
1489418 i know i should medal if i dont i will be disappointed in myself its within reach in both events
1489419 this year i really learned how to plan out my races well

1489439 ive always dreamed of making an album with guest artists singing in their native languages
1489440 its a way to illustrate the power and magic of brazilian melodies
1489441 is always an adventure and my main motivation is to record wonderful songs in the process i enjoy sharing with the world the diversity of brazilian music both is rhythm and melody
1489442 the music is as sunny colorful and sexy as the album cover
1489443 these constituents have the intelligence and they should have the free will to do this there are three candidates vying for the opportunity to serve but with this resolution this body is taking it upon itself to personally eliminate one of these candidates
1489444 i went straight to a pro league about two weeks after the olympics in 2004 and then i came right back i actually took some time off after the national team before the world championship which was two summers ago at most i have taken off two months within the last four years so i have pretty much been on the go
1489445 i came back and played right after the olympics and played right away i decided to take time off after my second summer i planed on doing that i had a little of rough time two years ago but i took the two months off and really came back and got ready to do this
1489446 i definitely think that it is more satisfying this time because i am struggling with an injury and i really want to do anything i can for the team i know i can provide a lot for this team
1489447 it was definitely harder because i was here for the whole four years the last olympics i entered a year and a half before this time around i was with the team for the full four year cycle this time around i was also a more an established player with this squad and started a lot so it has been a way different experience compared to last olympics it is definitely very hard and gratifying and i understand what a great accomplishment it is to have made the last two olympic squads
1489448 i am so happy for nicole i know this has always been her dream i know she tried to do it indoors and it didnt work out i am so glad that she found a different avenue to get here because i just know how much it means to her i am so happy for nicole and i cant wait to see her i just saw her about two weeks ago and that was fun but i cant wait to be out there with her and experience this together just like we experienced things in college
1489449 probably not we play every other day during the olympics i dont know her exact schedule but i know on the off days we will be practicing and watching video the only way would be if we would lose early which i obviously dont want to happen my parents are going to be there and support her because they are good friends with her and her family so i will get to hear about that through them and i just wish her the best
1489450 we definitely have an experienced team but i still think we are a sleeper team we chose our team really late and especially this summer we have been playing so many different lineups that i feel like nobody knows the real us i feel really good going into it because i feel like we are going to surprise a lot of people even though we have done well third in world cup and four in the grand prix playing with not a set starting line up every game we are still practicing hard right now and we will practice hard until our first round we definitely have some things we need to improve on but we also are going to creep up on some teams and surprise them
1489451 cassie has worked hard these past four years she has given all of her self and time to the usa national team it is unfortunate that she doesnt get to be with us at beijing because she is really part of our team she has gone to the world cup and qualified with us and has given everything she possibly can i am really sorry for her that she is not getting the satisfaction and the accomplishment of being with us but i still feel that she is with us i really hope she continues because she is really talented player she has grown not only since the first time she stepped on the court on minnesota but since the first time she has been with usa she is just a wonderful person and a great volleyball player and i hope she continues and doesnt take this as a defeat to her volleyball career but only to push her harder to maybe get to the next one
1489452 as a whole it all starts with mike hebert getting nicole and i there at the beginning of his time at minnesota we didnt do as well as some of the final four teams did but i am proud that nicole and i played a big part of building the minnesota program and getting it to where it was when cassie accomplished so much as a player on the gopher team nicole and i didnt get to be in final fours like cassie did but we still feel like we helped the program to get it to that point mike should get all the credit for his coaching and just the kind of person he is to develop players at such a high level and develop us as people it was a great experience playing for him at minnesota the volleyball program has great support compared to any school i have seen the big ten minnesota has such a high caliber in all athletics and academics and i give a lot of credit to the school as a whole and a program as a whole
1489453 definitely having fun and continuing to have fun is so important because there is no reason to do it if you are not enjoying it you will never get to the elite level if it is not something you truly want to do and dont let anyone tell you how far you can get because really it is up to you there are going to be people that doubt you your ability your height your physical appearance or your skill just dont let them determine your future you determine your future by working hard and putting your mind into it
1489454 definitely both world cups when we qualified for the olympics they were both very emotional times when you qualify for the first time it is unbelievable and it puts reality that at least the team is going to be there and that i am fortunate enough to be there not only playing for the us but my international experience playing professionally overseas has developed me as a player and a person more then i could have ever imagined or asked for that experience whether you make it to the usa level or a national team is still a great experience that many other players in college can go experience no matter if you are on the olympic team or not i would tell anyone that wants to pursue their volleyball career after college to go and do it it is unbelievable no matter how much money you make it is still a great experience
1489455 robin ah mow santos and i completely switched and shared time at the setter position both of us became starters i feel like a leader on this team the last olympics i was coming into i was very young i definitely feel like a leader on this team at this point and can provide not only my skill but the leadership that this team needs to stick together as a unit and just work hard i am better now and an older player but i think overall a lot of us are like that my role not only changed personally but also the whole team changed it is just a different squad and a different olympics and we are going to do the best that we can
1489456 i watched robins career all through her college years at university of hawaii i have looked up to her the whole time our relationship is probably the best relationship you will see in the world between two players supposedly competing for a spot it doesnt feel like a competition we help each other out at any time no matter who is playing i couldnt ask for a better friend or relationship with someone that i am in the same position with it is great i think any coach would want that also just with how interchangeable we are we dont make the team change too much we are very similar and i love it i love our relationship i love our working relationship and off the court and i think it is great for the team
1489457 it is really hectic especially this year because we finished the grand prix so close to the olympics that we have just been on the go since the grand prix double days are our life and we have been working so hard to get our team to gel it also goes along with meetings video and traveling we just went through the processing where we do all of the olympic stuff and we leave tomorrow aug 2nd it has been a whirlwind but it is the kind of whirlwind that you want it is an unbelievable experience and it is only going to get better from here
1489458 individually i am just trying to get whatever i can give to the team on or off the court and provide anything that will get us to where we want to be and the best we can be
1489459 dr hayne has dedicated many many years of his life to ensure that autopsies that were required by the state of mississippi were done

1489462 if defense lawyers are able to ask the question have you been fired on the witness stand its going to hurt in all those cases
1489463 the investigation brings to light egregious violations of virtually every aspect of iowas child labor laws
1489464 it is my recommendation that the attorney generals office prosecute these violations to the fullest extent of the law
1489465 typically when we have child labor issues its an issue of one or two individuals
1489466 from our point of view with this investigation its a large scale violation of the law
1489467 i needed money for my family because i could not help them
1489468 they asked me how old i was and i told them the truth
1489469 my first response is it doesnt surprise me because of all that i have heard
1489470 therefore i am grateful that this was brought to the attention of the proper authority and my hope would be that some sanctions would be taken because i do think that these young children were not treated with respect and they should not have been there in the first place
1489471 the fact that he fired it was pretty unbelievable that no one was hurt
1489472 if you dont come with me bad things are going to happen

1489482 researchers divided students into three groups a program only group of students who attended their afterschool program two or three times a week and did nothing else outside the school a program plus group who visited the afterschool programs two or three times a week and also took part in sports church programs music lessons or other extracurricular activities and a low supervision group who dropped in on a mix of afterschool activities from one to three days a week the researchers found over the course of the three year project that the more engaged students were in supervised afterschool activities the better they did on a range of academic social and behavioral outcomes for instance 3rd and 4th graders in the program plus group tallied gains on standardized mathematics tests that were 20 percentile points higher than those of children who rarely went the frequent attenders also made more progress in developing sound work habits task persistence and better social skills and in reducing negative behaviors such as skipping school or fighting

1489509 to have somebody that i consider a friend have been with dozens of times shared meals with treated as a friend to have her be an employee a subcontracted spy for the nra is just mind boggling its so venal

1489538 there has got to be a lot of mutual respect and trust

1489548 these results to some extent confirm suspicions that many people have about the importance of a persons college choice in giving them better pay opportunities down the line
1489549 what we still dont know is whether or not its the training or education the school provides that drives these pay differences or if the people from those schools are just wired to self select into jobs that are likely to be paid more

1489623 some companies may have booked some of their premiums into the second quarter from the close of the cpf rush so this 667 million doesnt actually state the decline quite accurately its actually down even more than that if you take into account some of the spillover business of march sales into april
1489624 the single premium market from cpf has softened significantly so a lot of our members are putting emphasis on the annual premium business
1489625 there may be a bottoming out of the single premium cpf market in the third and fourth quarters
1489626 this was largely from a couple of companies that had launched attractive fixed interest single premium products
1489627 whether its sustainable or not is left to be seen since the interest rate environment continues to be challenging to price attractive fixed interest products
1489628 it brought in new business premiums of more than 800 million within a period of slightly more than a month

1489650 our study shows that the efficiency of star cluster formation depends on the environment
1489651 dwarf galaxies closest to virgos crowded center contained more globular clusters than those farther away
1489652 star formation near the core of virgo is very intense and occurs in a small volume over a short amount of time
1489653 it may be more rapid and more efficient than star formation in the outskirts the high star formation rate may be driven by the gravitational collapse of dark matter an invisible form of matter which is denser and collapses sooner near the clusters center
1489654 we found few or no globular clusters in galaxies within 130 000 light years from m87 suggesting the giant galaxy stripped the smaller ones of their star clusters
1489655 these smaller galaxies are contributing to the buildup of m87
1489656 in m87 there are three times as many globulars deficient in heavy elements such as iron than globulars rich in those elements
1489657 this suggests that many of these metal poor star clusters may have been stolen from nearby dwarf galaxies which also contain globulars deficient in heavy elements
1489658 we are seeing a supercharging of these issues shortage of talent and lack of experienced leaders in environments where companies are trying to grow 10 to50 per cent
1489659 companies operating in asia will face people challenges that are unique to the region

1489686 es muy importante para nosotros hacer un torneo ac en chile y coquimbo ser nuestra carta de presentaci n porque la idea es que este campeonato se dispute muchos a os y realizar m s en otros lugares como iquique por ejemplo

1489691 en chile no hay cifras transparentes pero sin duda que los portales de empleo han crecido en forma exponencial ya que un n mero significativo de la fuerza laboral muy especialmente la gente entre 20 y 40 a os est registrada en ellos
1489692 no es menor la gran cantidad de vacantes de empleo que se publican
1489693 van desde trabajos a tiempo parcial jornada completa con o sin experiencia contrato indefinido pr cticas profesionales trabajos en el extranjero entre otras

1489695 y de preferencia llegar antes que cualquier otro posible candidato
1489696 es por esto que los curr culos en word ya no se hacen necesarios porque el mismo que tengo en la red lo puedo enviar por mail o imprimir por lo tanto no es necesario realizar la tarea dos veces
1489697 tomarse el tiempo para llenar los campos que piden los portales incluyendo dar respuesta a preguntas espec ficas
1489698 mantener los datos relevantes actualizados ya que para ser considerado es importante tener la informaci n adecuada y revisar los portales con periodicidad para mantenerse al tanto de la demanda de trabajo
1489699 lo m s probable es que quien est buscando gente recurra como primera alternativa a aquellos curr culos que ya tiene por ende quien particip en alg n proceso de selecci n sin tener suerte en una primera instancia tiene la posibilidad de ser llamado nuevamente por la misma empresa para ocupar otro cargo que se ajuste m s a su perfil

1489704 a significant turnover rate is expected in critical talent roles including managerial and entry level positions
1489705 resulted in a leadership crisis in many organisations and an impediment to future growth
1489706 were now seeing a supercharging of these issues shortage of talent and lack of experienced leaders in environments where companies are trying to grow 10 to 50 percent
1489707 the extent to which this becomes an impediment may depend on the stage of development for smaller richer economies like singapore which do not enjoy the advantage of a large and cheap labour pool the lack of a large enough talent base would likely be a critical factor holding back growth
1489708 an environment with tangible and intangible rewards can be created to motivate employees

1489710 its something the industry is taking seriously youd be in a bad place if you werent doing something about it
1489711 you can bet that the internet providers are going to stay tightlipped about any attacks on their networks

1489714 from a broader perspective the world is adjusting to new realities the adjustment process is painful for the industry
1489715 it is not going to be any easier as global institutions seek ways to rebuild their balance sheets and economies cope with slowdown and inflation

1489721 we never die this was one of our best a grand slam walk off against a team thats ahead of us our team is just unbelievable
1489722 its just a bad time to have to go through something like this
1489723 ive always said in order for us to be really what we need to be we need other guys to be able to close games i didnt know we would be forced into that
1489724 its going to be important that some guys step up

1489735 you guys are history buffs so based upon our past experiences with coach we have no clue whats going to happen and whos going to start were on a need to know basis and we dont need to know right now
1489736 i dont know it might be a nice changeup itll be coachs decision i didnt really think too much into it as far as who started the green white game saturday and well see what the decision is for cleveland
1489737 sometimes its one guy has a better day than the other and then it could flip flip in practice flip during the course of a day
1489738 well see who goes out there and who goes out there second
1489739 thatll be all up to coach it comes down to moving the team managing the game taking care of the football obviously and scoring points

1489814 because i said i saw thee under the fig tree believest thou thou shalt see greater things than these
1489815 wherein were all manner of beasts of the earth and fowls of the air
1489816 unless i put my finger into the print of the nails i will not believe
1489817 why art thou being the kings son lean from day to day

1489819 there are four things saith solomon that say not it is enough
1489820 if the lord would make windows in heaven might this thing be
1489821 what have i to do with thee o thou man of god art thou come to call my sin to rememberance and slay my son
1489822 there are many sins bound up in this one sin
1489823 from whence come wars and fighting among you come they not hence even of your lusts
1489824 lo i am at the point to die and what profit shall this birth right do me
1489825 lo i am even at the point of death my grave is going to be made and what good will the world do me if i have but enough till sun setting i am content
1489826 the corn being over ripe sheds and fruit when it mellows begins to rot when men do mellow with the sun of prosperity commonly their souls begin to rot in sin
1489827 how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of god
1489828 what leave my friends my native soil my brave situation and go turn pilgrim
1489829 is this the land i must possess here is no probability of any good all things are against me
1489830 hath dealt with me and would have me now study philosophy
1489831 shall i said seneca weep for cato or regulus or the rest of those worthies that died with so much valour and patience
1489832 he that loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver

1489835 pour out thy wrath upon the families that call not upon thy name
1489836 salute the brethren and nymphas and the church which is in his house
1489837 that we may grow up into him in all things who is the head even christ ep 4 15 where the apostle distinguisheth between our being in christ and our growing in him our ingratifying and our flourishing be not content with a modicum in religion
1489838 he reached forward and pressed towards the mark of the high calling of god in christ jesus
1489839 lord more conformity to christ more communion with christ he would fain have christs image more lively pictured upon his soul
1489840 the flowers will appear and the figtree put forth her green figs
1489841 we are bound to thank god always for you brethren because your faith groweth exceedingly
1489842 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports however labor markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress
1489843 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth

1489848 were pleased to see the investment doubleclick has made to enable customers such as nbcolympics com to take advantage of silverlight to offer compelling packages to their advertisers
1489849 microsoft has always had a strong commitment to working closely with partners and the industry to enable them to leverage our tools and platform to deliver great user experiences
1489850 with hundreds of advertisers multiple platforms and large site traffic spikes we needed to work with a partner that could provide an integrated scalable robust solution
1489851 by expanding doubleclick to work with silverlight 2 we can make it possible for clients to create unique entertainment and advertising experiences without increasing their workload or creating new complex processes said google product manager ari paparo
1489852 all of our business segments generated year over year gains with record profits reported at our satellite broadcasting cable programming film and television businesses

1489854 she has quite the task ahead of her when she gets here
1489855 its a really rough landscape shes going to be inheriting
1489856 theres going to have to be a lot of change and the new administration is probably expecting that
1489857 im not sure how much theyve budgeted to completely revamp the brand and the real estate that they own
1489858 the role to transform the bay from its existing format to world class was too compelling to pass up
1489859 building exceptional retail destinations is not only my profession its my passion
1489860 many of whom i have had strong partnerships with for several years
1489861 bonnie has spent more than 25 years building prestige retail formats around the world like holt renfrew lane crawford harvey nichols and leading designer brand stand alone stores in asia
1489862 retail acumen will assist her as she elevates the bay to a new position within the canadian retail landscape one in which the bay will be a premiere department store experience with better brands and service
1489863 the us federal reserve left the fed funds rate unchanged at 2 0 percent as widely expected by the market
1489864 todays fomc federal open market committee statement was clearly a disappointment for many market players and the recent strength in the us dollar may easily evaporate in a wave of profit taking
1489865 when riding a bike one of the most difficult things to do is to balance while trying to stay still
1489866 in a way that is what the market is trying to do so far this week waiting for the central bank announcements but trying to gauge how best to balance in the meantime
1489867 for now standing still may be enough to ensure that the dollar advances after all most other economies appear to be sliding backwards
1489868 contrary to all other major canadian markets where more than one new wireless operator will compete for subscribers quebecor media and cable tv subsidiary videotron will be the sole new entrant in quebec
1489869 the spectrum will allow us to offer wireless services comparable with what we find in the most advanced countries namely wireless high speed internet mobile tv services and other advanced features
1489870 no additional financing is currently required to support this investment
1489871 quebecor media offers our stable of publishing assets the best platform to survive and to morph into new territories
1489872 bundling has been a very successful strategy for our telecom services it can certainly serve the same purpose for our multiple print and online products
1489873 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1489874 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1489875 oil prices today are getting hammered on more signs that point to demand destruction
1489876 it appears that the weak economic numbers coming out of the uk will put pressure on the eurozone to worry more about growth and less about inflation and perhaps cut interest rates
1489877 rising supplies from opec are making participants painfully aware that deteriorating economic activity is making less and less of a call on stockpiles
1489878 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1489879 my view has been all along and it remains that the fed is going to be on hold for a good deal of time
1489880 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1489881 my view is that unemployment is going to go to 6 5 percent and that will be new information for the fed that will force them to keep rates unchanged for the next 12 months
1489882 mopco will complete the agreement negotiated with agrium to acquire agrium egypts shares and carry out the companys plans on the land allocated to it in the general industrial zone west of the navigation channel
1489883 this is an outstanding opportunity for agrium to construct and operate a facility in an area with long term competitively priced gas prime access to world markets and an efficient well educated workforce
1489884 agrium will be aggressively pursuing full recovery of its costs equity contribution and future lost profits
1489885 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1489886 the inflation fight probably will have to wait until 2009
1489887 conditions at this point do not seem to dictate an immediate tightening
1489888 labour markets have softened further and financial markets remain under considerable stress tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1489889 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1489890 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1489891 it was really a perfect storm that catapulted oil to its record of us 147 and now bit by bit youre seeing that really subside
1489892 bottom line the trend is moving down and probably will continue to do so slowly but surely for the next six months
1489893 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1489894 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1489895 we just see the whole country as being in pretty good shape housing market wise
1489896 due not only to the expansion of our own programs but to the withdrawal of other companies from our space
1489897 as we lend across the country we dont see anything that is really very risky to our business
1489898 were still lending but the nova scotia new brunswick market seems a bit softer and weve been cautious about that for about nine months
1489899 we dont quite have a handle on why it is softer but were doing predominantly ensured products there
1489900 just means when were doing a new loan in those ontario markets we just make sure that were very careful about the covenant the quality of the property
1489901 home continues to meet its targets and deliver strong results in all segments of our business
1489902 this shows the confidence the company has in the market place in the book of business we have and in the strong capital ratios that the company has
1489903 itll be interesting to see little number 29 play dantrell savage hes the team favorite right now hes kind of interesting hes a tough little guy
1489904 itll be fun to watch these guys play especially the running backs we know what larrys capable of doing but for the rest of these guys its probably the best depth weve had at that position since ive been here now what weve got to do is stay on the field offensively so these guys can play thats the whole key now make first downs so we can get a bunch of plays so we can watch these guys play
1489905 no doubt no doubt you talk about this guy and he came to the tryout he didnt even have a contract he came to the tryout camp with the other 60 guys that was kind of a like a gong show deal
1489906 we want to give him an opportunity to run and i think our whole team wants to see him run hes kind of a favorite kind of guy in camp right now
1489907 i dont know if he was a punt returner he was a kickoff guy i think and well give him an opportunity to do that i dont think hes ready for punts yet if hes a guy who makes your team you start putting him back there and see if he learns how to catch punt
1489908 he has tremendous instincts and vision and is very quick once he hits the whole he makes the quick decision and hes a tough guy
1489909 no not really when you look at all these backs its going to be a hard decision charles is a guy who is big time those kinds of guys make big plays they just hit a crack and its not a 10 yard gain its a 50 yard gain or a touchdown itll be interesting to see how this all plays out but as i keep saying the key is to get plays youve got to get plays youve got to get plays if you get plays in the pre season where these guys can run the ball you control the ball then you get a true evaluation of what they can do we have to do that
1489910 well hes dropped it a couple of times out here too and thats kind of been his deal
1489911 the best thing i told him is dont put it on the ground dont even do it in the warm ups never drop a ball and it doesnt come up but if you drop it the red light comes on and its free pancakes
1489912 youre not going to play for a whole lot of people that was one of our achilles heels last year we had way too many turnovers whether it was fumbles or interceptions you cant do that youre battling upstream the whole way and were playing a chicago defense that is known to take the ball away youve got to secure the ball this week
1489913 yeah and im hoping again just like the offense weve got to get them in position to kick field goals we didnt do a good enough job in the pre season last year to really have the opportunity to kick a lot of field goals
1489914 i think if we can just get into position where we have the ability to kick them weve got to kick them and weve got to score touchdowns weve got to get in position either or last year we werent in position to do that very often
1489915 there were a lot of breakdowns for a lot of different reasons one being on the field too long two not really playing our proper gaps and filling our responsibilities i think that goes on everyone whether its the defensive line or linebackers
1489916 but gun cunningham was really torn wanting to coach the linebackers too he was adamant about it and i kept saying lets just see then when the season was over with we decided that was the best thing for the football team
1489917 so now its really one of those positions where there is a lot of competition you have some guys penciled in to start which is fine but right now in our mind theyve got to go prove it to us on the field
1489918 ive always said this and now its coming to fruition being that this is the third season for me were going to play the best players were going to play the best players and the guys that do it the way we want to do it and are productive and understand its about the team and not statistics or fame but winning those are going to be the guys that play whether its a free agent guy a fifth round draft choice doesnt matter i just want to get the players that do things the way theyre taught to do them
1489919 i think there are some young guys now with a lot of talent but they need to be coached and gun is doing everything in his power to coach them you know when you put in a defense like this the thing thats always concerning is gap control because its a one gap defense if you blow a gap and dont spill the ball or turn it the right way all of a sudden its a free hit and the guy is running its costing these guys are learning and theyre getting better at it weve got to continue to get better at it in the pre season because weve got to be better against the run a lot of things help you against the run if the offense stays on the field it takes your defense off the field when youre playing with a lead that helps you against the run too because people cant run the ball in the fourth quarter thats what we would prefer them to do so that we can get after them it starts in gap control and the ability of the linebackers and safety that you bring in the box that are well coordinated and that they understand they have certain gap responsibilities
1489920 they give me grief every time we play red 2 in the red zone they say thats yours
1489921 theyve got to know because if we dont run the coverage right and tony dungy sees it i always get that phone call
1489922 las estelas de los meteoros que rozan la tierra son largas lentas y coloridas y constituyen una de las clases de meteoros m s bellos
1489923 because theres a lot of factors that go into that ill get together post practice watch the tape
1489924 i just want to go through the week finish up the practices finish up the meetings with the coaches with mike and then go from there
1489925 isnt derek going to start for cleveland thats just my guess thats why i read the defensive scouting report
1489926 i dont know whos starting who knows when theyll tell us
1489927 you guys are history buffs so based upon our past experiences with coach we have no clue whats going to happen and whos going to start were on a need to know basis and we dont need to know right now
1489928 i dont know it might be a nice changeup itll be coachs decision i didnt really think too much into it as far as who started the green white game saturday and well see what the decision is for cleveland
1489929 sometimes its one guy has a better day than the other and then it could flip flip in practice flip during the course of a day
1489930 well see who goes out there and who goes out there second
1489931 thatll be all up to coach it comes down to moving the team managing the game taking care of the football obviously and scoring points
1489932 weve been competing for quite some time now and its a body of work
1489933 it started way back in the spring so i think its going to be an overall evaluation i dont know how the games are weighted but they evaluate everything we do
1489934 if i had to say who is our best crossover guy who can get righties and lefties out it would have to be aaron heilman
1489935 ive closed a few games before so that certainly helps
1489936 as good as guys are and as much bravado as they have coming in i still believe major league success outweighs that
1489937 that puts you in a situation where the team cant rely on you and when they cant rely on you youre worthless
1489938 you watch your team compete and play and do nothing for them really youre of no use to the team so its awfully hard
1489939 they are trying to get the value they think is reasonably in its various parts
1489940 its the first time the olympic games are to be held on home soil and the chinese people have even higher expectations of us
1489941 all good things can turn into bad ones if wrongly handled as does the home advantage some players may be better motivated in front of the home fans while others may have to cope with much more intensity and pressure we have to look out for it
1489942 their chinas depth in rowing is very impressive and theyll want to put on a good show they have some established names and their standard is high
1489943 theres a very special media market in new york for sports teams
1489944 there is significant value over and above the average franchise because of the market
1489945 the agent said swimming tickets are hard to get even harder than the opening ceremony
1489946 we regret to inform you that our suppliers have not been able to honour their commitments to us in supplying tickets for the summer olympics despite having received written assurances from these suppliers we are given to understand that they have placed themselves in to bankruptcy
1489947 i have my daughter competing in the olympics and thats really great
1489948 its that i planned for two years for this trip spent tens of thousands of dollars to be there spent vacation time and now instead of packing my camera for the opening ceremony all i can do is go there and read a newspaper
1489949 the real harm here is this girl has spent eight years of her life getting ready to be on the world stage and she needs to be thinking about that and instead shes thinking about how her mom and dad got screwed out of tickets thats not right
1489950 i am going to have to tell my son next week that we will not be able to go to the olympics basketball game to cheer his stars kobe labron that i had promised to take him to
1489951 telling him this is going to be harder for me than losing the money
1489952 i really dont know what im going to do in china
1489953 the international olympic committee knew about this in march and didnt do much
1489954 a lot of people can still be accommodated if there were some adjustments to the transfer rules
1489955 it always makes me sad to read about bad things happening to rich people sigh
1489956 everyone should be boycotting the olympics china does not deserve to have it everyone buys cheap chinese low quality products and that just finances the government and military consumers and corporate managers are to blame for loss of jobs and ruined economies by china
1489957 id like to teach the world to sing in perfect harmony id like to buy the world a coke la la la la la la la la la la la
1489958 however i agree that it is a case of systematic doping this would fall under the new wada code that carries a four year ban
1489959 i shouldnt really say very much as i am no longer a part of the iaaf but this is a very bad story
1489960 for you alone are holy you alone are the lord
1489961 i would not want my first term consumed by what was perceived on the part of the republicans as a partisan witch hunt because i think weve got too many problems to solve
1489962 i dont think the next president will do that no matter who he is
1489963 i think a lot of us feel that the american people are entitled to the whole truth
1489964 the american people are entitled to an investigation from an official body that has access to the classified documents that makes as much public as it can
1489965 o ur time our energy should be spent in educating agitating organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace in the neighborhood in the schools our objective should be to build painstakingly patiently but energetically a movement that when it reaches a certain critical mass would shake whoever is in the white house in congress into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice
1489966 true religion will not let us fall asleep in the comfort of our freedom love thy neighbor is not a piece of advice its a command god my friends is with the poor and god is with us if we are with them this is not a burden this is an adventure

1489968 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
