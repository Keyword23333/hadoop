6330011 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up

6330013 right you are correct someone hooked me i do believe in building relationships that is what christians are required to do i am amoral i am sure you know what that means so are scorpios i am being protected by the formosa rule because of my mental illness i am not targeting teh mop jockey you are and you are using me as a bait please stop i have my own fish to reel in leave me alone it is my hope that i will be able to catch a fish and reel it in for you once my retired bishop thought i was fishing for him and he took the bait alas it wasnt me and that spelled the demise of our relationship have a little bit more faith in me an eastern orthodox bishop thought i was fishing for him and willingly proudly and defiantly took the bait on public record and it wasnt even me give me a break
6330014 not supporting me is equivalent to forfeiting your own rights

6330035 the international olympic committee themselves recognize that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
6330036 its a mistake to think that games model themselves on previous games every games ive been to has been very different
6330037 but we can be creative we know that more people will probably come to london for the games than to other cities
6330038 the days of just leaving 90 000 seater stadia particularly in london where youd have two with wembley are over
6330039 you have to provide something for local communities to do more than simply press their noses up against
6330040 ive always felt the primary purpose of a medal is that it signifies a big british moment and big british moments in sport have to have a conversion rate
6330041 for the chris hoys of this world and our rowers and swimmers the real challenge for our governing bodies and for sport more broadly is how many people can you get into the sport off the back of that great moment
6330042 slave state that fought beside the north thats only because we couldnt figure out how to get to the south there were a couple of states in the way

6330046 i mean these are not cataclysmic yet but we think there has to come when they will be
6330047 so while not critical at this stage over the next two years they will be and the impact on the public will be significant
6330048 were currently racing against time to digitise the most vulnerable parts of our collections before analog technologies become completely obsolete

6330052 im going live im definitely going to get another mri and stuff done back then the doctors said i just needed to take it easy and i pretty much took it easy for about five months it should be healed up
6330053 my main goal is to not get too many fights going thats kind of one of the things i blame for the loss with matt horwich
6330054 i just wasnt hungry i was kind of burnt out and i fought so much that year and trained so hard twice a day and just kind of ran myself ragged i just didnt have the fire when i went into that fight
6330055 it is now time to give back to those who want to learn what martial arts gave us
6330056 on sept 2 we are opening the florian martial arts center in brookline mass we will have classes and programs available for those who want to learn brazilian jiu jitsu wrestling mixed martial arts or who want to just get in shape with our fitness programs
6330057 i am not a prude in fact i am quite broadminded but this is completely inappropriate for children
6330058 i bought the book for my niece as a present and was reading it when i came across the word
6330059 the book has an attractive cover and is clearly for children
6330060 i did not expect this from a well respected author and do not want my young niece to have to see this obscene slang
6330061 she comes to visit me regularly and we read to each other
6330062 we have all the enid blyton books such as the famous five and secret seven and had finished all of them
6330063 i thought i would get her something a little more modern and had heard about jacqueline wilson through the popular tracy beaker television series
6330064 i knew she was held in high regard and had been a childrens laureate but thought i ought to read through the book to make sure it was not too sad
6330065 i got to the page where reference was made to a toffeenosed twit
6330066 on the next page the word changed i thought i was mistaken but then i saw to my shock it had been repeated twice again
6330067 i asked her if she was aware of this word and if she could do something about it
6330068 i would like her to explain how she would want me to explain this to my daughter even if it is in the context of the character
6330069 in the context of the character we felt it was used in a way that accurately portrayed how children like jodie would speak to each other
6330070 the book is aimed at children aged ten and over and we felt it was acceptable for that age range
6330071 however in light of this response we have decided to amend the word when we reprint the book
6330072 since the book was launched in march this year we have sold over 28 000 copies and this is the first complaint we have had
6330073 jacqueline wilson books are extremely popular with our customers and are the top selling childrens books in most high street stores
6330074 the publisher is aware of the word that is featured in the book and has agreed that it is not appropriate for children and will be reprinting copies
6330075 as soon as these copies are available we will stock them in our stores we are sorry for any upset caused
6330076 im sure joey obrien will become a top top player with the more games that he plays

6330083 were looking at the offers we have received then will move to sell those assets these are not just for optima but for digital city and 3cshop as well
6330084 there are various debtors outstanding for optima so were actively trying to collect those
6330085 this is a very complex area theres no quick fix
6330086 were not committed to anyone out there in the media wanting the warranties work as yet
6330087 games and computers are growing categories and were still gaining market share
6330088 looking at what the economists are saying its not going to be smooth sailing ahead but we have come through a very difficult period pretty well
6330089 well continue to do what weve done for the past few years and concentrate on what we need to do as retailers
6330090 we cant control things like interest rate hikes but we can control what types of products we buy and how we price them
6330091 the need for marketing grows as we expand in asia my other main role will be to look at more businesses that we might be interested in acquiring
6330092 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet
6330093 no longer just a passive experience unless the viewer wants it that way intel and yahoo are proposing a way where the tv and internet are as interactive and seamless as possible
6330094 companies that sell these notebooks can get more money for them just as intel can get more money for the chips that fuel them higher margins mean more and better business
6330095 plm apps are routinely cracked and pirated so are many other high value niche applications
6330096 ive talked to a software vendor who manufactures geology mapping software for oil drilling and every version of their software has been cracked and pirated
6330097 it could be a lead to a var value added reseller who could go in and say its great youre using this software but you need to pay up
6330098 these can be business opportunities for vendors depending on how they approach it
6330099 the key functionality of our software is to control any type of internal or local ports or interfaces of the endpoint computer
6330100 every computer being protected but it is completely centrally administered and deployed
6330101 we partner with people for example for encryption we partner with pgp on the software side and on the hardware side we partner with people like lexar media
6330102 we opt for integration with partners and the code is not merged into our products so we will not run afoul of u s legislation
6330103 because of this we dont have any problem with u s government controls
6330104 in my experience the biggest threat comes from usb devices
6330105 however memory enabled devices such as smart phones are also a growing concern this is because the capacity of personal mobile devices is often the same as usb sticks
6330106 the sales stats are telling us that demand for usb protection is growing
6330107 not just in vertical industries such as financial or military we are seeing large demand from legal healthcare and even municipalities and police departments in the uk the market is growing fast from large enterprises down to smb and other industries
6330108 although these are very advanced and natively integrated with microsoft active directory
6330109 in lane 1 we have adobe with its flash and attendant flex technologies downloaded millions of times and popular on high profile sites like youtube
6330110 in lane 2 its ajax asynchronous javascript and xml the popular ria technique used in countless web sites
6330111 in lane 3 its up and coming newcomer silverlight backed by software giant microsoft and now being leveraged by nbcs prominent olympics web site
6330112 and in lane 4 we have suns javafx used by web properties such as well its still in development
6330113 this isnt the type of market where only one technology is going to win
6330114 i think sun has the opportunity to catch up very quickly in that space
6330115 i would say that the javafx platform looks very good it has a lot of potential
6330116 weve seen the whitebox server market growing towards the end of 2007 and its continuing to grow quarter on quarter
6330117 australia is an smb marketplace and theres a tremendous amount of businesses sitting within comapnies that have up to 10 employees
6330118 typically whitebox servers also come in at a lower price point than their branded competitors
6330119 the average system value has gone up significantly and thats because of virtualisation systems are going out with a really rich high end configuration for virtualised deployments
6330120 the web continues to affect our lives in new ways and is quickly moving to the tv
6330121 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the u k where we can do that
6330122 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6330123 you know your teachers might be different this year i just dont know who youll get

6330129 we knew that because of his south asian heritage and a great personal
6330130 any time a leader dies its a moment of uncertainty and potential instability for the leadership here
6330131 comes at a time when they are basking in the limelight and good fortunes of chinas athletes which have been a delightful escape in a very difficult year for this leadership now before the games are over they are forced back into reality
6330132 whether they come or not the whole olympics has raised hong kong peoples sense of being part of china and their sense of pride in being chinese
6330133 i am so happy i cannot express my feelings in words
6330134 while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6330135 wang xiuying is almost blind and crippled what sort of re education through labor can she serve
6330136 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
6330137 many of them were part of al qaida despite the fact that many of them are helping us to fight al qaida
6330138 if they disband us now i will tell you that history will show we will go back to zero
6330139 i will not give up my weapons i will never give them up and i will carry my weapon again if it is useless to talk to the government i will be forced to carry my weapons and my pistol
6330140 all the americans are doing is paying them just to be quiet
6330141 justify paying monthly salaries to people on the grounds that they are ex insurgents
6330142 its like a moat theres water all the way around
6330143 you cant tell whats a canal and whats a roadway out here its that bad
6330144 we know from watching american idol that sanjaya appeals to many audiences
6330145 we knew that because of his south asian heritage and a great personal
6330146 we know from watching american idol that sanjaya appeals to many audiences
6330147 we knew that because of his south asian heritage and a great personal
6330148 we face a very real threat in global terror threats from radical islam nuclear iran
6330149 if you get somebody evil in a true position of power they can do terrible damage the best way for evil to triumph is for good people to do nothing
6330150 im not going to go to that convention the republican convention and spend my time attacking barack obama
6330151 im going to go there really talking about why i support john mccain and why i hope a lot of other independents and democrats will do that
6330152 are you better off than you were four years ago are you better off than you were eight years ago
6330153 well then why the heck would you want to do the same thing
6330154 youd think that things are so bad that the economys in such bad shape that we might not even have to campaign
6330155 but the truth is that john mccain is a decorated war hero and the republican party hasnt been very good at governing but theyre very good at running negative ads
6330156 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6330157 let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact
6330158 because i wanted alaskans to have a firsthand opportunity to learn the facts of this matter
6330159 its a remarkable achievement for these two pilots and for helicopter pilots around the world
6330160 but flying around the world in a helicopter is a totally different animal
6330161 and if youre going to do it why not try to break the record
6330162 i believe that the administrations of the future will recognize both the threat that we face and the substantial commitment that our allies have now taken for missile defense
6330163 russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6330164 it is going to be easier to make our case on capitol hill now
6330165 what we can do for these children now we are their mothers and fathers
6330166 i had a first class community and village to bring me up everything a child could dream of i had it
6330167 people rarely died the first one i knew i was 18
6330168 i love the face of poverty darling poverty live with me forever

6330171 he was just spending a day at the beach with his family
6330172 hed gone to the foot of the cliff to take off his shoes and a small section of the bluffs just gave way and came down
6330173 i dont think the cause of these sad tragic deaths was yours
6330174 personally i have a hard time calling that true justice
6330175 if ellreese daniels had not been on that fire line my son would have probably lived
6330176 what mr daniels did up there that day was not the sole cause of those firefighter deaths
6330177 the person who keeps getting blamed for everything is ellreese daniels
6330178 wind and fire killed the four people on the rocks
6330179 the dead included women and children as most of the fatalities occurred due to the incidents of houses collapsing
6330180 it is impossible to separate the political from the commercial aspects of that display
6330181 for example the state argues that frazier can sell his shirts without displaying the soldiers names but fraziers product is his message and his customers message
6330182 by anyones reckoning these olympics have been a disaster for australia
6330183 most galling of all has been our complete and unmitigated failure in the equestrian competition
6330184 if the government has any sense it will make investment in this most watchable of sports a first order priority for the next 12 months
6330185 estadio mateo flores will be protected by 100 special forces agents 1 200 police officers 1 000 soldiers 250 transit police 180 private security guards and one anti riot squad
6330186 we have a 6 foot 5 inch guy thats running 9 6s and beating the rest of the olympic field by two tenths of a second
6330187 unfortunately over the 80s and 90s there was always a kind of boundary heres hopkins and heres east baltimore we felt that this parcel could be that link that gateway for the community into hopkins
6330188 every time a shovel goes in the ground in the city it gives someone the confidence to say things are happening again lets get moving
6330189 we do not view what would be happening more than a half mile away as necessarily competitive to our efforts but i do think it behooves all of us that we do coordinate our respective efforts to ensure the future of east baltimore is a solid one
6330190 the school did not merely find the confederate flag offensive to some students but rather found that in a context of high racial tensions race related altercations and threats of violence the flag would disrupt the schools educational process
6330191 we have all along felt it was in the best interest of our school environment to not allow any symbols that might be racially divisive in any way
6330192 its very clear this panel doesnt like the confederate flag
6330193 that was their starting point in coming to the decision they did the subject matter of the ban is not supposed to be relevant at all in a first amendment analysis
6330194 showered his mistress with large sums of money and expensive gifts
6330195 i think what happened yesterday represents a struggle between sunni and shiite politicians and some are trying to settle old scores
6330196 it seems to me that some leaders of the security forces are trying to ignite sectarian strife again
6330197 in the end not many students got charged so what was the point
6330198 why target san diego state im sure this stuff happens in the ivy league too
6330199 theyre trying to say we wasted our time doing this did we no
6330200 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6330201 food prices tend to go up pretty quickly and they tend to stick on the way down
6330202 basically theres only a few cents worth of corn in a box of corn flakes so food prices are much slower to react to the downside than energy prices
6330203 as long as were in this world of expensive oil and commodities the prices that youre seeing now in the grocery shelves are not going away
6330204 it means food inflation isnt a temporary problem its not going away

6330210 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6330211 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6330212 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6330213 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6330214 using taxpayer money to bail them out looks like its becoming reality now
6330215 the rationale for government involvement is to maintain fannies and freddies role in the marketplace which comes through buying mortgages
6330216 paul reed smith is really one of those homegrown success stories that you always hope youll be able to keep in the state
6330217 they have been working on this expansion for a few years now and we wanted to be a part of that and give them any assistance we can
6330218 there are some large segments of the market we should be addressing
6330219 we have the skills and the supplies and the talent to do it but we were out of room and now we wont be out of room
6330220 together we can make it while the world is crashing down
6330221 were always fascinated by eccentrics because we think theyre so out there
6330222 but the reason they appeal to us is they show us some portion of ourselves in a distilled manner
6330223 any time i want to dismiss her as crazy theres something that happens thats utterly truthful you keep being drawn in to her
6330224 its stunning but i think its been a little bit buried under the legend of those performances the most common question i get is well how are you going to do this without christine ebersole and the answer is you do it its a great musical
6330225 oh shes so lovable when i watch the documentary which im using as a template for line readings and body language i just want to hug her
6330226 people are pulled toward little edie because she is iconic like holly golightly or sally bowles or even judy garland she wears her flaws openly sometimes aware of them sometimes not but she clearly always has a passion for life that is rich and compelling
6330227 theres something about the humanity of these two their intertwining and the need they have for each other
6330228 the love and care that they have for each other shines through
6330229 i held hands with a gay man in san francisco and all i got was never mind
6330230 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6330231 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6330232 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6330233 if i had gangrene in my toe and the doctors had to amputat sic it how long before i can go back to work
6330234 he was a very energetic little guy always all over the place why are we doing this when are we doing this what are we doing next
6330235 naughty isnt a word that i would use he was playful inventive
6330236 pool rat running around sneaking up behind people stealing their snacks and goggles tapping them on the shoulder and running away and just causing general havoc
6330237 in my middle fingers i liked to twirl pens and pencils but if they werent available at dinner i might try to substitute a salt shaker or steak knife i should have known i couldnt twirl glasses of milk
6330238 you find children who have adhd are very creative individuals very determined and they can focus they can focus very intently on something that they love
6330239 it is very important to be able to allow your child to experience all sorts of things to be able to focus on what they enjoy and what they have a passion for
6330240 he is quite relaxed in fact i get more worked up
6330241 i feel he is definitely settled and if there is hyperactivity he is able to handle it very calmly
6330242 we felt that this service was really a general interest sports service that was disguised as an amateur sports service
6330243 it certainly appears it will have the opportunity to air at least one professional sports show in prime time each and every night thats obviously a concern for us but the crtc in its wisdom has decided its appropriate so we will carry on
6330244 considering the programming that they are suggesting considering the genre protection rules and the amount of opposition they received im a little surprised

6330250 how patty hearst s kidnapping reflected and ravaged american culture in the 70s
6330251 it was the kind of question many of us were grappling with in our own lives and patty hearst gave us the perfect excuse to talk about or own situations without really talking about them not directly we needed someone like her just then

6330253 capitol briefing apologizes for the error and will be more careful as he continues to report this story

6330255 we want whats the best for caylee we want caylee found
6330256 its not about getting casey out to make sure she feels better
6330257 its all about the interest of finding caylee hopefully she will get us some information
6330258 is the way the younger players migrate to him a lot of young guys are intimidated by a superstar but his personality makes them so comfortable with him
6330259 hes like us hes like a kid playing the game for fun and isnt it supposed to be fun
6330260 he picks up his wife he hasnt seen her for a while and hes on his iphone looking at his at bats
6330261 why did no one run over to help him in an emergency maybe his life could have been saved
6330262 peoples lives are being lost but sometimes i wonder if anyone cares if another mexican immigrant dies
6330263 you see people crouching underneath tractors when you go out in the fields we think workers should be able to rest with dignity
6330264 if somebody doesnt have shade up and available for workers this summer theyre going to get a whooping
6330265 collections has been a problem historically and we need to fix it i cant sugar coat it
6330266 people have been dying all along every year for decades and now that were finally focusing on it were finding all these heat fatalities were doing all we can with the very limited resources we have
6330267 unscrupulous employers can game the system by filing frivolous appeals
6330268 we cannot expect our workers to endure a lengthy series of appeals especially when people have actually died from these conditions
6330269 is the purpose of cal osha to induce compliance and protect workers or is the purpose to collect fine money from employers
6330270 encouraging employers to settle gets the hazards abated more quickly and gets employees protected more quickly
6330271 i completely understand that cal osha is overworked and understaffed but whats offensive is that the agency is reducing fines with no justification
6330272 in some cases companies are paying pennies on the dollar from the original fine imposed
6330273 ricky is elated to begin this new chapter in his life as a parent and will be spending the remainder of the year out of the public spotlight

6330275 there were no skyline shots or expo building or anything but i was like oh hey
6330276 i think its a regional thing where people like to watch something they know is produced locally
6330277 its just the fantasy of knowing thats someone you could run into somewhere
6330278 when youre shooting in regina and winnipeg nobody there has any illusions that theyre going to be huge movie stars
6330279 i wish i could say oh yes there is a canadian aesthetic youll always see canoes and snowshoes
6330280 but really it just tends to be lower budget and amateur
6330281 i think its an interesting opportunity to promote canadian entertainment
6330282 this isnt stuff thats going to be shown on cbc
6330283 as canadians we want to be able to not only see ourselves but support our country
6330284 i think theres a difference in what we produce whether its literature or pornography
6330285 capture the essence of their sexuality and the intimacy that is occurring
6330286 i have visions of ski cabins and things like that because we try to get outside whenever we can
6330287 but unless theres a vancouver aesthetic in peoples interiors it will be hard for people to know where its from maybe theyll be able to tell by the smallness of the apartments

6330299 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6330300 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6330301 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6330302 my internet business is designed with serious internet entrepreneurs in mind that are looking for all the tools resources and products needed to create any size income from working online we are not in the business of selling hype we will leave that to the other companies out there
6330303 its been a long time but finally we internet marketers have a successful company with terrific products that cover such a broad field its also invigorating that all the packages are complemented with the most all embracing and complete training obtainable anywhere in our industry it has never been done until now it is quite innovative for our market without a doubt and i am enormously proud to be part of it

6330318 its fair to say the mayor was upset with the video
6330319 the mayor made it clear in no uncertain terms that city departments were to comply with the water directive just like every business and residence
6330320 the mayor was in no mood to hear excuses he wanted to hear solutions
6330321 wheel weights have been identified as the largest new route of lead releases into the environment
6330322 by moving the industry away from leaded wheel weights we are helping to keep the lead out of our kids drinking water
6330323 we are pleased that the court has approved settlement of this matter so that we can move forward with our aggressive plans to eliminate the use of lead wheel weights in our products
6330324 by the end of this month we expect that all of the vehicles we produce will be equipped with wheel weights made from alternate materials 11 months ahead of the schedule set in the settlement agreement in california
6330325 for environmental reasons this is the direction the industry is going
6330326 we fully expect dozens of states to follow californias leadership and ban the use of lead wheel weights
6330327 its a gift anymore to have a legislator who can really dig into a complex issue and be able to mete out a fair deal the stuff that people used to do up here that make things work
6330328 when you look at the scope of the bill its pretty significant
6330329 one issue everyone has been afraid to touch is land use
6330330 everyone understands about using alternative fuel but land use has been the third rail ab 32 changed the equation because now land use has to be part of the solution to global warming you cant meet our goal just with alternative fuels you have to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled
6330331 if people are going to drive and they are going to drive we need to plan in ways to get them out of their cars faster that means shrinking not the amount of housing not economic development not growth but shrinking the footprint on which that growth occurs
6330332 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public
6330333 it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation

6330347 see this is where he sleeps in the summer he sleeps this side but in winter he moves to the other mattress we have to manage with just these two coolers so he moves to be more comfortable
6330348 with this medal we hope our needs are better looked after than before here there are 20 people to a room with two people to a bed not all rooms have coolers like ours and we have to share the space with rats and other animals here theres room for everybody
6330349 this is how weve been living we have to make do with what we have its very tough but what choice do we have
6330350 perhaps now that sushil had got a medal more money will come into the sport we have brought it to the attention of the authorities many times but it hasnt made a difference so we carry on
6330351 this is him with his 2005 arjuna award and heres another during the 1998 asian cadet junior meet where he won gold now he has an olympic medal
6330352 we are all very proud of what he has achieved and we cant wait to meet him at the airport
6330353 sushil also had the same difficulties but he had said hell win a medal and he did here at the stadium there are wrestlers from all over the country who are living in these conditions and i hope they are all inspired by what he has done wrestlers dont get jobs so many are unwilling to take it up seriously but now things will be different
6330354 callous attitude of the sports authority of india sai administration could seriously hamper indias medal prospects
6330355 that would be more in the spirit of the olympic ideal
6330356 it is time to get off our offense and onto some new meat
6330357 it was good to see us pick off a couple of passes
6330358 they havent been throwing a lot of interceptions it was important for us to make some plays
6330359 the good thing about bryson is he is pretty reliable the thing about matt is he brings a lot of big plays to us but weve got to get him more consistent
6330360 it is time to get off our offense and onto some new meat
6330361 just a little bit every day however much you can manage after school
6330362 and dont look so grumpy the days are shorter and shorter
6330363 looks like youre near the center though thats pretty cool
6330364 hard to tell at this angle are they heading for us
6330365 whered they even go i mean really are they just hiding back there until we leave
6330366 this isnt hard hadyn some big birds dive bombed us they dropped these cool tubes it makes no sense its awesome totally factor 10 cool
6330367 maybe theyre some sort of carrier pigeon but do carrier pigeons even fly anymore
6330368 only on gilligans island tv land listen to me youre just guessing
6330369 obviously they are what if they need to carry these things farther still what if theyre just resting what if they are trained to do this when they need to rest drop their packages find a hole rest then grab their stuff and carry on
6330370 so are you suggesting we flush them out cause there is no way im going to crawl back there they can get out later on their own

6330392 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6330393 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6330394 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important

6330417 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6330418 positive bio spots that theyve been running the balance of the summer dont appear to be making any significant connection with undecided voters
6330419 when the senate investigated the senator in charge never even called reed to testify and that senator john mccain
6330420 and whos now raising money for mccains campaign ralph reed
6330421 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail
6330422 what the obama people are doing is they apparently have developed individual targeted strategies for states and media markets within states
6330423 they will be speaking very directly to different groups of voters within those battlegrounds
6330424 thanks to everyday americans who chose to make a difference millions of lives have been saved in the worlds poorest countries
6330425 we want to remind them that the public is out there eager for them to say more about this
6330426 callers did not think they were bound by the do not call list and now they are
6330427 i have never seen anything like this in my life
6330428 we firstly want to convey our deepest sympathy and condolences to the pretorius family we realise you have lost what you loved most due to the actions of our child we are terribly sorry and wish so deeply that these were not the circumstances and that we could change it
6330429 morn was very small and skinny for his age group until monday morning we never thought he would be able to do something like this we are a very close family and we raised our children strictly but with a lot of love
6330430 because of his build morn was regularly bullied during his formative years
6330431 he explained to us that he felt so powerless and worthless that he wanted to make a statement
6330432 he went to school with the intention of hurting and scaring them it wasnt aimed at a specific person and he didnt mean to kill anyone he wanted to vent his built up frustration and feelings of powerlessness he wanted to be someone
6330433 morn was a very small baby at birth and in life we got to know him as quiet and obedient
6330434 we regret to say that it appears that morn experimented with satanism and that it gave him a kind of protection for his psyche it was as if he wanted to escape to the idea that he would have certain powers which would then give him a way to protect himself
6330435 his words to us were when i put on the mask everything went dead quiet and my body started moving i wanted to stop but i couldnt
6330436 he also mentioned that the matric exam put a lot of pressure on him although he had never failed a grade he was terrified of failing
6330437 we suspect a combination of stress poor self image bad influences and an absolute feeling of powerlessness drove our child to this terrible deed
6330438 we call on all parents to have a proper conversation with their children to ensure everything is all right one is inclined to attribute certain personality changes to physical development but it isnt always the case
6330439 we ask that you please pray for us the pretorius family and everyone who was affected by this we also want to use the opportunity to thank everyone for their support
6330440 undoubtedly caused further delay and uncertainty in respect of house purchases
6330441 the current economic conditions the uncertainties surrounding the general financial markets and mortgage availability will be defining factors in the return to a more normal housing market
6330442 until we see an improvement in respect of these factors it is difficult to predict the short term future with confidence
6330443 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin its looking bleak but every effort is being made
6330444 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6330445 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6330446 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6330447 we rethought those plans and came up with a way to put a lid on the cells instead of the razor wire
6330448 the important thing is this has to function as a normal jail
6330449 the nature of jail is to create an environment where you can maintain security and order and one of our primary charges is the care and custody of inmates
6330450 let me state categorically that cosatu not only respects the independence of judiciary but actually regards it as the corner stone of our hard won democracy
6330451 it is just a myth driven mainly by media hysteria that we have no respect for these pillars of our democracy
6330452 where we draw the line is the attacks on an individuals dignity without giving the courts an opportunity to make their own determination
6330453 this in my view undermines the role of the constitution and the courts more than anything else
6330454 the headlines were genuine criticisms of particular judicial decisions which are then conflated into a supposed attack on the judiciary as a whole
6330455 i think its very important for us to remember that we live in a district that is moderate common sense independent thinking kind of district

6330458 for all the talk about changing the electoral map the core of it is still the same right here
6330459 mccain is looking at the nature of the electorate and has a reasonable chance to cherry pick some voters
6330460 these are the kinds of voters who were reluctant to vote for obama in the primary and the republicans think they can make inroads with them
6330461 the solid republicans are going to suck it up and vote for mccain the solid democrats are going to suck it up and vote for obama
6330462 but there are a lot of people in the middle i think theres hay to be made in my county
6330463 obama strikes me as a good family man he seems like hed be a decent guy but my values are more along the lines of what john mccain stands for and believes in
6330464 theres no way in hell im voting for the old establishment

6330470 once you master a horse but it also masters you you gain more confidence in yourself
6330471 in many ways the civilian prosecution of sergeant jose luis nazario jr is reminiscent of the governments response to the april 2004 abu ghraib prison scandal numerous low level enlisted soldiers were tried and convicted for abusing detainees no high ranking officers were ever put behind bars
6330472 fallujah was declared a free fire zone in november 2004 and we told the civilian population that they had to leave because the entire city was going to be deemed hostile territory
6330473 some of them left they carried tvs or food and sat outside the city and waited for the firefight to be over so they could go home
6330474 we would just leave the dead iraqis in the streets and they piled up
6330475 it was disgusting we ended up sighting in our weapons on these dead bodies wed been trained to keep our weapons on point you always want your weapon to be sighted in so when we didnt have a target to shoot we sighted our weapons on dead people and dead animals that happened a lot at the tail end of operation phantom fury
6330476 they made decisions without collaboration and input from teachers on many things
6330477 its a fine line between charging people for a service they need and pulling the wool over their eyes and charging them for something they either dont need or could easily do themselves for free
6330478 we hate to see people paying for a service they dont need
6330479 its not too much to ask our elected leaders to lead by example but i think the drug tests distracted from the main issue
6330480 the drug tests are not going to solve the problem
6330481 the majority of the concerns that this board has faced about ethical behavior at the end of the day is rooted in one individual
6330482 i have a gun in your ear and i will kill you
6330483 were going to vote them out of office because theyre not properly representing the citizens of moss point
6330484 do you know who you are f with we are the police
6330485 raising eyebrows in brussels and contradicting the western alliances secretary general
6330486 its an important signal but there is also important substance to it
6330487 in practical terms nato is offering close cooperation with the georgian government and the georgian military
6330488 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6330489 it was a favor as huge as we could have gotten it was like a drowning man getting thrown a life preserver
6330490 just when ned was trying to establish himself as a credible alternative on the war barack obama came in and said hey i disagree with him on the war but you should send him back to the senate
6330491 how is so and so i havent seen him in a coons age
6330492 why can the world not permit two lovers any two a moment of escape free of all its claims to be in love just the two together each the others all
6330493 sappiamo che la stagione estiva una finestra ideale per una pellicola adatta alle famiglie e ancora oggi scontiamo le ripercussioni dello sciopero degli sceneggiatori che ha bloccato gli script di altri progetti cambiando tutto il panorama competitivo del 2009 e allo stesso tempo offrendoci nuove opportunit da cui vorremmo trarre vantaggio
6330494 there is no violation of law and theres been no malfeasance proven there is no law against not getting along
6330495 its about being black and being subject to human error
6330496 i think if sacs found the board dysfunctional thats the way it is i dont think a leopard changes its spots
6330497 none of these school board members you filed a petition to remove represent your district
6330498 as i look at the table i see five white petitioners against four black defendants
6330499 we didnt pick and choose if we would have made it racial he wouldnt have been named at all
6330500 if you can stay away from those comments i would appreciate it
6330501 i taught 150 children a year for about 20 years i want all of those children to be proud of where they went to school and not shun that they went to clayton county schools

6330507 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
6330508 simply based on somebodys race religion or exercise of first amendment rights
6330509 this seems to be based on the idea that the government can take a bunch of data and create a profile that can be used to identify future bad guys
6330510 but that has not been demonstrated to be true anywhere else
6330511 i am genuinely concerned i think australians are beginning to feel genuinely concerned that less than 12 months after the last election they are going backwards in net terms
6330512 well i obviously am representing my constituents and they are concerned

6330517 bekele is a phenomenal athlete just like your own pamela jelimo or haile gebreselassie and paul tergat were but moses masai and micah kogo are very good athletes by any standards
6330518 i must congratulate the coaches on their technical decisions selection and training the idea of running at the olympics is not only to win but get experience and exposure
6330519 look at bekele and sihine since 2003 they have been world or olympics gold and silver medallists even in cross country they are still at the top masai won the 5 000m race in berlin in one of the best times this season 12 50 beating tariku bekele 12 52
6330520 he again ran 12 55 in barcelona he is a fast athlete but still needs to build on endurance
6330521 the reason bekele lost in last years cross country in mombasa was he had just been to the indoor circuit he focused on the indoor circuit which is a three kilometre event he could not have come out of it and done well in cross country a 12km race
6330522 look at the russian gulnara samitova who won the steeplechase my god she ran a world record here 8 58 81 that is the first woman athlete to run under nine minutes eunice jepkorir who was second also set an african record 9 07 41

6330528 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend
6330529 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6330530 barack obamas own campaign is the only one talking about his patriotism
6330531 we should be using some of that money to rebuild virginia laying roads building broadband lines and putting people back to work
6330532 we sure as heck dont have to give them incentives to move we should give companies tax breaks that are right here

6330534 while these changes will increase listings impact to the demand side of the equation remains to be seen
6330535 given that ebay made no change to financial guidance as a result of the lower insertion fees the increase to final value charges are clearly significant

6330540 i hope beach volleyball will have a faster development in china through our success at the beijing games
6330541 i am not surprised as i always said that china would do well here
6330542 i thought the usa would have the edge in terms of the total number of medals won but based on golds only i could see china doing well
6330543 this success will last as long as the sporting system lasts here
6330544 to be in the final re writes chinese hockey history
6330545 it is good to be in the final no asian team womens has ever won gold in the olympics on friday we will change the world history of hockey
6330546 ever since the ball dropped in athens weve wanted to repeat as olympic champions
6330547 the rain makes it better we felt like warriors out there
6330548 athens was just pure excitement the pressure of this situation is real and it was heavy and it was loud and we beat china at home under crazy conditions
6330549 it could have been 500 degrees or 500 below and wed be happy
6330550 im so happy im just the happiest girl in the world
6330551 they are more experienced and stronger but we have made great strides for these olympic games this is the best that we could do

6330557 kulit menua kendur dan berkerut itu relatif namun tidak semua orang ingin kulitnya kelihatan menua kendur berkerut atau kerutannya tidak bisa dihilangkan bagi wanita hal itu dilihat sebagai masalah
6330558 jadi anak anak yang hidup di abad 20 usia harapan hidupnya lebih panjang mereka pun tidak mau kulitnya bagus hanya sampai usia 40 tahun kemudian menjadi jelek alasan lainnya saat ini penampilan yang baik dan awet muda sudah menjadi kebutuhan lagi pula sekarang sudah banyak kosmetik dan obat obatan untuk mencegah penuaan dan meremajakan kulit
6330559 perawatan sejak dini itu perlu selain itu menjaga kesehatan tubuh itu penting karena kesehatan kulit tidak terpisah dengan kesehatan tubuh
6330560 intinya kita memperlambat proses penuaan dan meremajakan kondisi kesehatan dengan sendirinya kecantikan akan terpancar jika kondisi tubuh sehat
6330561 memanfaatkan teknologi modern berupa layar sentuh komputer lcd seperti yang lazim digunakan pada beberapa bank atau bandara internasional hanya kali ini penggunaannya bermanfaat pada kesehatan dan kecantikan untuk mempermudah penegakan diagnosis
6330562 i think these are sensible and proportional ways of toughening up what is already a very tough system i think thats what we owe to children in this country and to children abroad
6330563 save room for our tiramisu it was voted best in the region
6330564 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6330565 this is a significant step forward in the long term management of low back pain
6330566 the results of this study revealed that the alexander technique can help back pain it probably does this by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving co ordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6330567 this means that patients can have fewer activities or functions limited by back pain
6330568 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
6330569 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
6330570 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
6330571 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
6330572 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
6330573 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
6330574 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
6330575 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
6330576 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
6330577 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
6330578 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
6330579 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6330580 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6330581 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6330582 just 12 months after the acquisition of egl it is a pleasure to announce this solid set of results they are a credit to the hard work of all our employees in recent months we have realigned our organizational structure into four geographical regions in order to create a more customer focused and responsive structure we have also developed a very clear set of strategies and plans to shape the future direction of ceva our customers are reacting positively to these changes and we have experienced a number of significant wins during the quarter although trading conditions are challenging we believe that cevas current momentum will allow sustained progress
6330583 were doing jokes about people in his orbit not really about him
6330584 people have a tendency to react as far as their ideology allows them
6330585 i think some of us were maybe too quick to caricature al gore and john kerry and theres maybe some reluctance to do the same thing to him
6330586 anything that has even a whiff of being racist no one is going to laugh
6330587 the audience is not going to allow anyone to do that
6330588 most readers will see it as tasteless and offensive and we agree
6330589 totally inappropriate and frankly i understand if sen obama and his supporters would find it offensive
6330590 we put people in a crazy box they might be truly offended by it but the reaction is part of the standard digestive process bill maher who is host of a politically oriented late night show on hbo said if you cant do irony on the cover of the new yorker where can you do it one issue that clearly has some impact on writing jokes about obama is a consistency among the big late night shows not only are all the hosts white the vast majority of their audiences are white i think white audiences get a little self conscious if race comes up sweeney of obriens show said things might be somewhat different if even one late night host was black black comics are not having any trouble joking about obama said david alan grier a comedian who starting in october will have a satirical news magazine show on comedy central chocolate news i tell jokes on stage about him grier said reciting a few that would not ever get onto a network late night show nor into the new york times but he said of the late night hosts those guys really cant go there its just like the gay comic can do gay material it comes with the territory
6330591 no way theyve had 200 years of presidential jokes its our time jimmy kimmel the host of the abc late night talk show jimmy kimmel live
6330592 theres a weird reverse racism going on you cant joke about him because hes half white its silly i think its more a problem because hes so polished he doesnt seem to have any flaws maher said that being sensitive to obama was in no way interfering with his commentary though on hbo he has more freedom about content than other comedians theres been this question about whether hes black enough
6330593 i have this joke what does he have to do dunk he bowled a 37 to me thats black enough kimmel said i think his ears should be the focus of the jokes mostly the late night shows seem to be in a similar position were just waiting
6330594 there hasnt been a lot of frame of reference about obama yet not like hillary or mccain but there will be
6330595 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6330596 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6330597 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6330598 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6330599 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6330600 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6330601 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6330602 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6330603 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6330604 it is hopeless this one is like the other one they are all the same nothing will change dont expect change
6330605 hell have to be good to israel if not he wont be re elected to a second term
6330606 will remain the capital of israel and it must remain undivided
6330607 the arabs need america to be straight and unbiased but anyway we feel that american policy will not be changed too much
6330608 one day he is with the palestinian cause one day hes with israel we have a saying here whats better a black dog or a white dog its all the same for us nothing will change
6330609 we rooted for this and that and nothing happened its deja vu
6330610 unless the americans realize that they really have to change and become more evenhanded and apply justice in the region things will be the same
6330611 obama is excellent he is direct he is like the successor to jfk
6330612 yes they are all bad but still obama might be a little less bad
6330613 for me it doesnt matter that hes black or his name is hussein
6330614 hes an american and so i disagree with most of what he says about the arab world i mean condoleezza rice was black and poor and she still invaded iraq
6330615 i think its very impressive that someone can start very poor and reach the top like this
6330616 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6330617 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6330618 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6330619 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6330620 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6330621 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6330622 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6330623 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6330624 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6330625 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6330626 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6330627 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6330628 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6330629 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6330630 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6330631 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6330632 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6330633 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6330634 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6330635 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6330636 intels latest mobile form factor specification represents an exciting new direction for notebooks as it introduces new specification standards for the key components including the case motherboard and lcd panel this significant change creates an opportunity for other manufactures to develop products as well as implement strategies specific to the mobile market which gives system integrators greater flexibility in design product features and service options
6330637 the interest in the form factor specification has been beyond expectations as integrators recognize the potential of being able to enhance their service capability related to notebooks since they have greater access to spare parts that adhere to a specific specification this ultimately gives them the ability to differentiate their brand and compete on value rather than price
6330638 intels latest mobile form factor specification represents another step in the development of the mobile ecosystem as it creates opportunity for the entire supply chain
6330639 asis experience working with multiple suppliers who have different business models to ultimately bring solutions to the channel will contribute to the success of this latest initiative and we look forward to their involvement
6330640 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
6330641 the movie revolves around a singular day when jimmy page the edge and jack white first met and sat down together to share their stories teach and play
6330642 captures the guitarists as each explains and demonstrates how he changed the sound of the electric guitar to suit his own distinctive musical style
6330643 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6330644 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6330645 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6330646 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6330647 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6330648 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6330649 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6330650 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6330651 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6330652 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6330653 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6330654 the roman catholic church which was supposed to carry the light of the gospel plunged the world into the dark ages
6330655 john paul ii will be remembered for staring down communism and embracing people of all faiths and colors
6330656 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6330657 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6330658 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6330659 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6330660 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6330661 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6330662 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6330663 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6330664 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6330665 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6330666 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6330667 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6330668 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6330669 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6330670 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6330671 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6330672 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6330673 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6330674 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6330675 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6330676 that blowhard needs to close his yap or lose his job
6330677 hey this makes sense its charles krauthammer and hes talking on this subject this will convince you
6330678 it honors the hard work of so many people who supported sen clinton
6330679 many of the pennsylvania delegates worked their heart out for sen clinton and theyre excited to cast a vote for her from my vantage point that will be closure for them
6330680 the government has taken tremendous liberties with our liberty taking away our liberty in the name of fighting terrorism using fear to take away peoples rights and their privacy in this country
6330681 and thats caused me and a lot of americans to lose a great deal of faith in the government which ought to be protecting our liberties not taking them away
6330682 they simply dont want the competition from an outsider so to speak somebody that might make them feel uncomfortable by raising some issues some new perspectives some new choices for the american people
6330683 youll get to see hillary speak on tuesday and barack obama the next president of the united states on thursday
6330684 and i hear hillary and you will have a chat ill make sure to stop by
6330685 call last week for americans to break their addiction to oil
6330686 hay dos tipos de personas en el mundo los que saben que tener una copia de seguridad es muy importante y los que van a sufrir un ataque al coraz n proximamente
6330687 stockholm region is one of the global frontrunners in the knowledge economy especially within sectors such as ict life sciences and finance wkci 2008 is yet another proof of that
6330688 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
6330689 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
6330690 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
6330691 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
6330692 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6330693 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6330694 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6330695 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6330696 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6330697 he said after the last eight years even our dogs and cats have learned that elections matter
6330698 it was so relevant to what we are doing here
6330699 we came up with something funny to fuse our interests in dogs and politics
6330700 we figured there were many dog afficionados who are also interested in politics
6330701 she was a stray but she worked her way up
6330702 well just be sending each other e mails at two in the morning instead of two in the afternoon
6330703 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6330704 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6330705 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6330706 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6330707 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6330708 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
6330709 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
6330710 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
6330711 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
6330712 in the olympics we recognize that its possible for two competitors to both be perfect 10s a judge who feels that way can give both athletes the top score americans dont have that option in the voting booth even if you like two candidates you can vote for only one this is the root of the spoiler effect whenever two candidates base of support overlaps like al gore and ralph nader in 2000 voters who like both have to choose one and sometimes that prevents the most popular candidate from winning its happened at least five times in u s presidential elections one possible reform is to use a rating system much like that used in the olympics some have criticized scoring systems as complicated but people use them online all the time now rating videos and books on youtube and amazon both computer simulations and some real world trials have made a strong case that rating systems do the best job of reflecting voter sentiment
6330713 no matter when such election reforms are more widely enacted theres no good reason why pollsters shouldnt conduct some polls giving people greater choices right now
6330714 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
6330715 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
6330716 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
6330717 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
6330718 after the crimes they know they have committed and that many of us know they have committed because we have seen the evidence some of which has even appeared on the corporate whore news media of late
6330719 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
6330720 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6330721 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6330722 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6330723 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6330724 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6330725 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6330726 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6330727 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6330728 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6330729 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6330730 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6330731 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6330732 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6330733 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6330734 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6330735 half of dems nationwide agree that hillarys act of putting her name in nomination you know that heinous scheming act at the heart of hillarys plot to steal the convention for herself think it will help unify the party only 28 disagree
6330736 i believe her testimony could have changed the course of history now others believed that she would hurt anita hill
6330737 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6330738 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6330739 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6330740 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6330741 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6330742 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6330743 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6330744 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6330745 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
6330746 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
6330747 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
6330748 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6330749 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6330750 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6330751 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6330752 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6330753 were not going to pay for votes or pay for turnout
6330754 they told me there are going to be resources here
6330755 thats what we do in philadelphia we pay people to work they understand that
6330756 as a campaign we really are enjoying working with congressman brady and mayor nutter and congressman fattah
6330757 i think were going to need that because of the middle part of the state
6330758 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6330759 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6330760 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6330761 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6330762 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote
6330763 20 wind by 2030 increasing wind energy contribution to u s electric supply
6330764 would be accomplished solely through private investment with no new customer or corporate taxes or government regulation
6330765 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
6330766 tuesdays event illustrates the inherent challenges associated with using wind energy because the wind sometimes stops blowing without a moments notice engineers at ercot must remain nimble enough to respond to resulting instability on the grid
6330767 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6330768 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6330769 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6330770 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6330771 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6330772 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6330773 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6330774 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6330775 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6330776 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6330777 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6330778 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6330779 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6330780 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6330781 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6330782 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6330783 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6330784 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6330785 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6330786 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6330787 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
6330788 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery

6330792 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6330793 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6330794 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6330795 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6330796 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6330797 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6330798 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6330799 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6330800 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6330801 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6330802 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6330803 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6330804 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6330805 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6330806 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6330807 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6330808 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6330809 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
6330810 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
6330811 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
6330812 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
6330813 this district was unrepresented for 8 years under mcclintock mcclintock is so far to the right that his own party has problems with him
6330814 conejo valley residents are an educated bunch a good number of us are employed by amgen or baxter biotech firms we are savvy about climate change and will discriminate between the good arguments offered by scientists and bad arguments offered by a few feckless politicians mcclintock has consistently opposed sensible measures to protect our air water and wild places he opposed important measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles ab 1493 2002 to recycle toxic electronic wastes sb 20 2003 and to increase california s supply or clean renewable energy sb 1078 2002 mcclintock attacks gore conservationists disputes global warming science october 29 2007 in an october 12 speech to the western conservative political action conference california state senator tom mcclintock mounted a persuasive and yet poorly informed attack against al gore conservation and the most widely accepted scientific theory of global warming this is fortunate mcclintock s comments have assured his well deserved fate of political irrelevance and ignominy mcclintock repeated well worn republican jokes about personal jets and gore s electricity bill he mentioned several laughably out of date theories about the causes of recent climate change he even proudly admits that his knowledge about climate change has its most profound roots in his grade school musings this position is damaging to the republican party and will cause it to lose votes in california and nationally
6330815 seems to be in a time warp the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming 82 percent of independents did too mcclintock didnt do himself any favors on this one hes just handed democrats and even his likely 2010 republican gubernatorial primary opponent steve poizner an issue to campaign on making it even easier to paint mcclintock as an extremist out of touch with california values
6330816 the most recent ppic poll shows that even 60 percent of republicans see an immediate need to tackle global warming
6330817 well i think that whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
6330818 obama mccain discussion with megachurch minister warren has auburn producer director
6330819 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6330820 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done

6330824 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6330825 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6330826 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power

6330828 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6330829 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
6330830 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
6330831 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
6330832 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6330833 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6330834 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6330835 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
6330836 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
6330837 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6330838 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6330839 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again

6330846 oh my word i have been lumbered with making a health and safety presentation to my department ive never done this before and i cant get out of it help
6330847 how would you rate your self confidence where 1 is totally confident and 10 is whoa no confidence at all
6330848 as far in advance of the presentation as possible pick one obstacle with its counter feeling
6330849 oh yeah and find a quiet place where i will not be disturbed for approximately five minutes
6330850 i remember now the idea is for me to imagine how i would like to act and feel when making the presentation i am to imagine me feeling calm and confident right
6330851 continue to work down your entire list imagine being confident as the presentation gets closer you will feel yourself becoming more confident
6330852 and on the day of the event i fly through it with complete assurance and confidence i remember it now i dont know what i was so nervous about silly me

6330857 the airlines must stop the tailspin thats hurting passengers and communities alike
6330858 they have failed horribly to provide professional quality jobs for airport service workers here at lax and across california
6330859 they have engaged in a tailspin that has forced wages and benefits down to a level where people cannot survive in these jobs
6330860 how can the airlines expect us to keep coming to work with the money they pay us when we cant raise our families get a higher education or afford the gas to be able to drive here every single day
6330861 it would be a tad chaotic to say the least so people might want to reconsider their travel plans and skip l a and head to san francisco or san diego instead
6330862 the airlines would probably try to fill the jobs rather quickly but the new workers would be thrown into the fray with minimal training which would lead to more frustration among travelers because operations would significantly slow down
6330863 lots of screaming and cursing from the strikers because they will be considered as scabs
6330864 while it is not in our authority to mandate a remedy we offer our encouragement and hope that both parties meet again soon to frame a solution that serves a common good
6330865 it is regretful that we have gotten to a point where a strike is being considered

6330867 obviously theyre grasping at straws trying to find something they can try to get people mad about

6330882 that is the way things have always been and as far as he was concerned that is how they will be

6330895 and hereby we do know that we know him if we keep his commandments he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby know we that we are in him
6330896 and he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him and he jesus in him and hereby we know that he jesus abideth in us by the spirit which he hath given us
6330897 and this is love that we walk after his commandments this is the commandment that as ye have heard from the beginning ye should walk in it
6330898 think not that i am come to destroy the law or the prophets i am not come to destroy but to fulfill
6330899 for verily i say unto you till heaven and earth pass one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled
6330900 but the day of the lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent heat the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up
6330901 wherefore then serveth the law it was added because of transgressions till the seed should come to whom the promise was made and it was ordained by angels in the hand of a mediator
6330902 now to abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one
6330903 and if ye be christs then are ye abrahams seed and heirs according to the promise
6330904 whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven but whosoever shall do and teach them the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven
6330905 but in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men
6330906 and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the
6330907 a thousand shall fall at thy side and ten thousand at thy right hand only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because thou hast made the lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against a stone
6330908 and i saw another angel ascending from the east having the seal of the living god and he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt not the earth neither the sea nor the trees
6330909 i thank god through jesus christ our lord so then with the mind i myself serve the law of god but with the flesh the law of sin
6330910 forasmuch as thou art sent of the king and of his seven counselors to inquire concerning
6330911 that thou mightest fear the lord thy god to keep all his statutes and his commandments which i command thee thou and thy son and thy sons son all the days of thy life and that thy days may be prolonged and thou shalt bind them
6330912 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the beast and his image and receive
6330913 and if it seem evil unto you to serve the lord choose you this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whose land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the lord
6330914 homosexual acts between individuals are immoral and that we should not condone immoral acts i do not believe that the armed forces are well served by saying through our policies that its ok to be immoral in any way not just with regards to homosexual acts so from that standpoint saying that gays should serve openly in the military to me says that we by policy would be condoning what i believe is immoral activity
6330915 the dont ask dont tell policy allows an individual to serve the country
6330916 right now we are discharging soldiers at a time when we dont have enough people to do the missions we need around the world because theyre gay not because theyve done anything but just because theyre gay

6330926 it is a big story that is going to cause controversy
6330927 its very rare that a film changes history but i think this is a turning point and in five years the idea that the greenhouse effect is the main reason behind global warming will be seen as total bollocks

6330959 si abbiamo trovato proprio il momento giusto proprio qui dimmi cosa vedi
6330960 cosa devo vedere ci sono tante persone che camminano o vanno il bicicletta chi accompagna il cane o corre chi gioca al pallone o prende il sole
6330961 si va bene ma scendiamo meglio nei particolari anche io non avevo mai fatto caso a queste cose ma una volta ne avevo parlato con loracolo e siamo arrivati alle stesse conclusioni perch una persona per esempio si appassiona a uno sport e unaltra ad un altro ovviamente ogni persona vede in quella pratica delle cose che unaltra non pu vedere o percepire spesso si dice che non gli interessa e solo con questo potrebbe essere spiegata quella affermazione ma lesempio pu essere applicato anche in altri campi o modi di pensare a si i modi di pensare ogni persona pensa in modo differente da unaltra persona ognuno pu percepire cose che a unaltra persona restano indifferenti si possono avere in mente delle idee che da altri non vengono comprese in considerazione solo perch un altro ha fatto delle altre esperienze o percorsi diversi e da queste cose nascono gli attriti le incomprensioni le persone non capendo gli altri danno dei giudizi che non sono veri non veri per il soggetto indicato certo gli altri fanno sempre in fretta a giudicare gli altri spesso denigrando gli altri e cosi nessuno capisce gli altri perch tutti si arrogano la verit verit che non hanno spesso quelle persone sono discutibili
6330962 e come facciamo a capire o comportarci con queste cose
6330963 prima di tutto non dobbiamo mai parlare male degli altri sempre meglio dirne un gran bene anche se in sproposito si passa sopra pi facilmente su una grande frase benevola che su una malevola anche se tutte e due vorrebbero criticare il soggetto in questione quindi non giudicare possibilmente non rispondere agli altri non sai mai cosa hanno in testa con il silenzio e losservazione lo capirai anche se ci vuole pi tempo ma avrai una idea pi chiara di chi hai davanti in fine cerca sempre di respingere o rimandare via chi hai davanti questo per darti unaria pi misteriosa che non guasta mai poi se tornano lo faranno in modo pi consono e stai attento a quelli che ritornano con il sorriso in faccia quelli sono i peggiori
6330964 ma ci vogliono tutte queste cose per conoscere il pensiero delle persone
6330965 non sempre delle volte basta un colpo docchio ma li ci vuole una grande esperienza di vita o semplicemente la bestia nel cuore

6331053 who does not like to make love a handsome young man one who is gentle
6331054 but mostly it is horrible the farmers here they are not like the boys of bombay
6331055 sometimes ten unknown people what kind of life is that
6331056 every day my children ask who is my father they do not like having a mother who is in this business
6331057 once i tried to open a bank account with my son
6331058 we went to fill in the form and the manager asked fathers name after that my son was angry he said i should not have brought him into the world like this
6331059 we are sorry we have to do this work but what is the alternative
6331060 when we are not beautiful when our bodies become ugly then we will be all alone
6331061 if we live long enough to be old and to be ugly
6331062 one of our community died last week two others last month
6331063 if someone told him his own urine had alcohol in it he would drink that too
6331064 if i were to sit under a tree and tell you the sadness we have to suffer the leaves of that tree would fall like tears my brother is totally bedridden now he has fevers and diarrhea
6331065 he used to be such a handsome man with a fine face and large eyes now those eyes are closed and his face is covered with boils and lesions
6331066 we dont know what feelings she has about us who really knows what she is thinking
6331067 the goddess looks after us when we are in distress she comes to us sometimes in our dreams sometimes in the form of one of her children
6331068 if you come to her with a pure heart she will take away your sadness and your sorrows what more can she do
6331069 i had no feelings at the time except wondering why have they done this we were very poor and had many debts my father was desperate for money as he had drunk and gambled away all that he had earned and more and he said this thing will make us rich it will make us live decently
6331070 at that age i had no devotional feelings for the goddess and dreamed only of having more money and living a luxurious life in a
6331071 soon after i had had my first period my father sold me to a shepherd in a neighboring village for five hundred rupees
6331072 it happened like this the night we arrived with my sister they killed a chicken and we had a great feast with rotis and rice all the luxuries even the rich could dream of then my mother went home to her village and i went to sleep with my aunt i was asleep when the man came around nine
6331073 i realized something was going to happen and started crying
6331074 eventually i went to bombay with my devadasi aunt who had promised to show me the city
6331075 before long a rich man came and saw me at my duties cleaning the house he refused all the other girls and just demanded to have me i was scared as he was very hefty very fat so instead the
6331076 eventually i agreed to take the big man he offered five thousand rupees for me and the
6331077 by that time i had had my first two children a daughter and a son and it was partly for them that i went back to my village i lived with my mother and for the last eighteen years i have done
6331078 i have been lucky and ive made good money i can still earn two hundred to three hundred rupees from a single client its true that i sometimes feel this is not dignified work there is a lot of insecurity but i have looked after and married off my sister i feed my mother and my son and i now have eight acres of land with the money i have earned on it we keep four buffalo and four bullocks thanks to the generosity of the goddess i will escape this work when i have saved some more and live by selling the milk and curd from the animals
6331079 one was a singer she eloped when she was fourteen she came back a year later but no one would marry her so she became a devadasi
6331080 the other had some skin disease and had white patches on her thighs we went to many doctors but they could not cure it like her sister she found it hard to get married so i had to dedicate her too
6331081 but how could you do that when you were so angry with your own mother for dedicating you you just said yourself this is undignified work
6331082 both have passed away maybe it was because of some sins in a past life that the goddess cursed me in this way one lost weight and died of a stomach disease the other had fevers
6331083 do not dedicate your daughter there are other ways of showing your devotion
6331084 you cant see it but you know its there and you can see its effects
6331085 then give them back to them but now that is illegal
6331086 if a buffalo has a calf the first milk after the birth is brought to the devadasis to say thank you to the goddess during the festival of yellamma the people bring five new saris to us as gifts every full moon we are called to the houses of brahmans and they feed us they touch our feet and pray to us because they believe we are the incarnation of the goddess
6331087 when we are called for pujas like this we feel very proud
6331088 when a child is born they make a cap for the baby from one of our old saris they hope then that the love of yellamma will be on that child
6331089 unlike other women we can inherit our fathers property no one ever dares curse us and when we die the brahmans give us a special cremation ceremony
6331090 we have some dignity we dont pick people up from the side of a road we dont go behind bushes or anything like that we spend time with our clients and talk to them we are always decently dressed always wear good silk saris never t shirts or those miniskirts the other women wear in bombay
6331091 you see we live together as a community and all this gives us some protection if any client tries to burn us with a cigarette or to force himself on us without wearing a condom we can shout and everyone comes running
6331092 there is no devotional feeling in bed fucking is fucking there i am just another woman just another whore
6331093 there is always fear we know that even if you persuade all your clients to wear a condom one broken one can infect us and once we are infected there is no cure we will die if not today then tomorrow
6331094 you see i know what its like i watched both my daughters die as well as at least six of my friends i nursed many of them some lost their hair some had skin diseases some just became very very thin and wasted away one or two of the most beautiful girls became so repulsive that even i did not want to touch them
6331095 but we must continue this work if we are to eat we have a lot of misery to bear but that is our tradition that is our karma we try to show our happy side to the clients to keep attracting them and put all our efforts into doing a good job
6331096 as i told you i have bought a little land and one day i hope if i can get some more buffalo and a few goats maybe i can save enough to retire there and live by selling the milk and curds yellamma will look after me
6331097 of course if it wasnt for her how could an illiterate woman like me earn two thousand rupees in a day yellamma is a very practical goddess i feel she is very near she is with us in good times and bad
6331098 the families are happy to live off them and use the money they earn but as soon as they become infected or at least become bedridden and sick they are dumped in a ditch sometimes literally just abandoned we had a case before christmas one girl was taken to a private hospital in bijapur after she complained of severe headaches the hospital ran some tests and found that she was h i v positive and on top of that had a brain tumor she began treatment but her family checked her out because of the expense and took her home we found her in a semi comatose state completely untended by the same family members she had been supporting for years she wasnt even being given water we took her straight back to the hospital ourselves but it was too late she died two weeks later
6331099 then its good that rani will be retiring before too long
6331100 she said she would get some land and some buffalo and try and make a living from that
6331101 but rani is been h i v positive for eighteen months now ive seen the tests
6331102 its not full blown aids at least not yet the medicines can delay the onset of the worst symptoms but they cant cure her

6331107 with higher energy prices there is an opportunity to make better use of this fibre by converting it to bio energy and other products
6331108 by better utilizing the resource we can promote economic diversification ensure healthy forests and improve air quality its a real win win for rural communities and the environment
6331109 by exploring and promoting alternatives to the open burning of logging debris well be able to significantly reduce air pollution from that source and to better protect the health of british columbians
6331110 the b c forest sector is actively taking steps to reduce its environmental footprint
6331111 this program is a great opportunity for researchers to work with forest operations managers to create and showcase science based innovations that will reduce wildland fire risk while protecting b c s air quality
6331112 the company wants to operate the mill so that sounds pretty positive
6331113 its sad to think that one company can hold another hostage
6331114 including the former employees of the company at the mackenzie pulp mill and the district of mackenzie
6331115 the new government should it be formed will include barisan nasional mps because we do not have enough mps
6331116 we just didnt stick to it and once you give them a sniff its over
6331117 they can go small they can go big and theyre all good
6331118 you try to play them one way and as soon as you think youve got some stops got some momentum they just totally change the way of the game and then all of a sudden the momentum is all them
6331119 the thing we tried to do is not play like every other team and play off the dribble we tried to play with passing and cutting but they adjusted and played very hard in the second half
6331120 weve been in games in this tournament where teams have led or are tied with us at one point
6331121 you look over at the scorers bench and theyre bringing in kobe lebron and carmelo

6331124 there is absolutely no evidence that any gang activity was involved in this
6331125 we have no idea what caused this fire we are still in the preliminary stages
6331126 i went through and said youve got all my paperwork its not like i was trying to hide anything
6331127 we have been focusing on crime reduction and prolific offenders and we believe that is having an impact
6331128 we have less crime in prince george than people think we do
6331129 some of it is high profile so it draws attention and makes for that perception
6331130 we have to keep pace with inflation or were just adding to our backlog of roads and schools
6331131 somebody has to pay for those roads and other services all seven council members need to take a rigorous look at the numbers weve had impact fees since 1987 and they have been changed or added to three times in 20 years
6331132 i dont believe anyone here today wants to stop or destroy economic vitality in this county
6331133 i dont think anyone believes the economy is in an upswing we need to look at the numbers but this is the place we start with
6331134 these fees are going to affect plans we started years ago
6331135 it takes years to develop a project and to suddenly get hit with these fees the economy of our projects are seriously damaged anne arundel county is already a difficult county
6331136 this would be very damaging for development with these fees id say half of my projects would fail at the least we support the idea of a longer phase in a grandfather clause something
6331137 living only five minutes away from the annapolis dinner theatre as it was known in 1990 when it opened
6331138 i really liked working as part of the music hall crew from 1995 until 2000 and again in 2001 for a couple of shows after the national annie tour
6331139 i spent the whole of 2004 at the music hall until it closed we had a lot of fun and there was a certain warmth from everyone
6331140 david was my rock a solid performer i could always count on to fill most any shoes
6331141 almost always my leading man it was terrific playing opposite him in so many shows

6331143 she knows theater in the round so well and knows characters so well and focuses on the truth and making certain that the story is being told
6331144 she makes the actors delve into the hearts of the characters and how they evolve during the course of the play
6331145 every role now is very important to me he said
6331146 i try to make my characters as human as i can
6331147 it was the closest thing to hell that i have seen
6331148 the government is overwhelmed very affected as are all spanish citizens by this tragedy

6331151 at that time we brought the first asian american family on television it was like a really ground breaking thing a very difficult thing and you know im very proud now to bring the second asian american family to television
6331152 im actually no 1 and no 2 so thats an achievement
6331153 some days the day works out how you want it to some days it doesnt that was obviously not my best day
6331154 we have the responsibility to program to attract the community
6331155 an educational institution is about innovation and we have a unique opportunity to do interesting performances all the elements are in place our ballet would be involved our theater will challenge audiences with issues to think about many four year colleges dont have the expertise and richness of talent across the board that exists here
6331156 no author demands as much as shakespeare or provides more

6331159 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6331160 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2 000 km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6331161 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale

6331166 i could be bitter angry or upset all the time but thats not going to do anybody any good
6331167 there were a lot of tears and a lot of hugs
6331168 and it was heartwarming to see much of the seattle music scene show up in honor of one fine man
6331169 there are no words that can begin to describe our loss
6331170 was a man of few words with a million dollar smile
6331171 had been coming to st vincent for meals for 20 years
6331172 at breakfast on monday he collapsed and was shaky and confused
6331173 he returned to the drop in centre that afternoon and said he was feeling better
6331174 i gave him a pair of shoes once because the soles were falling off his own but he insisted there was still lots of wear in his own and wanted somebody more in need to have the good ones
6331175 one of the other fellows living in the hotel walked by his open door early that morning and said he was sleeping when the fire broke out he tried to get to j j s room in case he hadnt woke up but the heat was too intense
6331176 he was a real nice man about 67 years old who once in while would shake his finger at you and say you be good but normally he had very few words but when he smiled it touched the core of your being
6331177 our guests become our family and we become their living room
6331178 we called him clyde but he kept changing his name
6331179 he was a warm helpful and kind man who sometimes would push the hot dog carts and do repairs to earn some extra money he was declared unemployable by social assistance and that allowed him to have dental work done he was on the street but he was never a bum
6331180 that makes them eligible for emergency measures over three days for living accommodations
6331181 the ministry of income assistance has said it will move quickly this is well in hand and everything is being done to meet the needs of those displaced by the fire
6331182 we want to create a network of scholars across disciplines to help us bring this abstract concept under the lens of science
6331183 a lot of the definitions of wisdom today are grounded in ancient writings but are they relevant today we need a new viewing of wisdom in the 21st century
6331184 we thought we would start with young scholars in hopes of getting cutting edge approaches

6331187 the most dangerous thing most of us will ever do
6331188 people who were driving alone got into more crashes than people who were with passengers its another set of eyes to spot potential danger another person to see if youre falling asleep and keep you awake another human being the drivers responsible for
6331189 doctors who study diseases and epidemiology say that once you say somethings an accident it takes it out of the notion that it can be controlled or reduced or prevented
6331190 thats why the british medical journal in 2001 announced that the word would not be used in its papers on traffic statistics
6331191 i keep stories about accidents and saw one about street racing i think it was in maryland last week people were going 110 miles an hour one person went out of control and killed some spectators the word accident was sprinkled through the story

6331196 the nature of the campaign is changing less than a week before the convention starts
6331197 obama felt he was sitting with dr phil and he was trying not to offend anybody mccain seemed to understand he was running for president his answers were more direct and aimed at the electorate
6331198 the primaries are preseason you can make mistakes but now were into the first game that really counts
6331199 obamas folks are reading their own press clippings too much and theyve got to understand theyre in a dogfight
6331200 the party is very bad at labeling things that provide an umbrella for other positive memories
6331201 which reagan used to evoke a feeling of hope and promise in the country

6331204 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing top hat and tails so his debt attracts more attention
6331205 if youre a debtor ill make sure that everyone who knows you knows that you owe money
6331206 your neighbours your clients your suppliers youre not going to like that
6331207 the way these companies approach consumers often borders on being illegal
6331208 acting in a way likely to be publicly embarrassing to the debtor
6331209 bridgestones participation in 200 formula one races shows the level of commitment we have given to the sport and we are delighted to be working with all of the teams and so many major motor manufacturers in our current position as official tyre supplier participating in a major sport brings us many benefits and in return we hope we have helped the sport grow just as we have grown through being part of formula one
6331210 bridgestone is very happy to be celebrating its 200th grand prix since 1997 entering formula one was a big step for us twelve seasons ago but one which was very valuable as our brand awareness has increased significantly since then formula one is one of the biggest sports in the world so we are very proud of our role as official tyre supplier for this and the next two seasons

6331233 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6331234 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6331235 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6331236 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6331237 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6331238 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6331239 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6331240 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors

6331244 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6331245 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6331246 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6331247 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6331248 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6331249 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6331250 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6331251 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6331252 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6331253 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6331254 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6331255 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6331256 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

6331262 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6331263 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6331264 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6331265 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6331266 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6331267 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6331268 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6331269 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6331270 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6331271 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6331272 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6331273 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6331274 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6331275 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6331276 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6331277 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6331278 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6331279 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6331280 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6331281 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6331282 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6331283 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6331284 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6331285 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6331286 it achieved some of what it set out to do
6331287 we certainly know a lot more about what plants do well in prince george
6331288 people have been very resistant to anything that wasnt grass or annuals they dont like anything that looks different so i dont think weve done very well in our goal to persuade either the city of prince george or the public of prince george that sustainable landscaping can be a viable alternative
6331289 the weeds dont seem to be coming back as quickly once theyve been eaten and i suspect over two or three years what youre going to get is weed die off
6331290 ive had some early indications that the city staff might be interested in moving towards it its certainly a very cost effective mechanism for them in the long run they certainly do control a lot of weeds
6331291 starting the day i get back from recess its all budget all the time
6331292 i think if anybody of either party tries to torpedo this effort they do it at their own peril because theres clearly a mandate for change

6331302 when they said this year that there was a possibility theyd team up the two creepiest bad guys i got so excited i had a list of people i wanted to work with and he was on it
6331303 its been an interesting dynamic were both jockeying to be in the lead position but im not going to give anything away
6331304 in the first two episodes just dont blink or youll miss a lot there is more action than youve ever seen at once before
6331305 i know john mccain i know his love of country he will choose the best person and if that person happens to be among other things pro choice the party will support that
6331306 im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy im just hot
6331307 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul
6331308 this man wishes to be accorded the same privilege as a sponge he wishes to think
6331309 i become fearful when i see people substituting fear for reason
6331310 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
6331311 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
6331312 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
6331313 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
6331314 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
6331315 a handful of trees rub trees are used for years by different grizzlies who each approach the trees in exactly the same way
6331316 they will step into the footprints of other bears that have approached the trees urinating as they approach
6331317 then they rub their back on the tree turn around and then bite the tree and claw it then they give it a bear hug by rubbing their chest against it and then they rub it with their back again
6331318 its pretty clear to me that the democratic agenda is to turn us into france
6331319 i wouldnt call him a pleasant surprise but he has definitely put himself in the mix in a very short amount of time
6331320 he has shown very good cover skills and cockiness that a corner needs to be able to get on field hes not afraid of anyone and hes not afraid to tell anyone and hes not afraid to tell anyone in the free world willing to listen
6331321 hes got so much athleticism that even if hes not at the two deep at this point before its all said and done youre hoping he is
6331322 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul

6331330 so if youre not looking at it precisely it is hard to distinguish between the centrosome and golgi
6331331 we show that not only the centrosome but the golgi also makes microtubules
6331332 and unlike centrosomal microtubules which are radial and symmetric these microtubules are directional
6331333 right now all too often your questions are brushed aside
6331334 what they dont need is another governmental intrusion into the relationship between themselves and their doctor
6331335 the idea that anyone could con her doesnt seem right to me
6331336 i think the handwriting on the postcard ive seen isnt the same as lindas handwriting
6331337 i have dealt with a lot of artists she wasnt a flaky artist she wasnt anything like that she was very quick about sending stuff she was very excited to be doing the work
6331338 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that
6331339 i had no direct knowledge and no direct participation in the recent care of the patients in question patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility
6331340 chronicles the dramatic unscripted real life experiences of a group of celebrities as they make the life changing decision to enter a treatment program
6331341 somehow supplied or facilitated contraband prescription medications soma and norco resulting in a medication overdose

6331351 it doesnt matter whether they followed the regulations or not i wont permit them to drill wells mine lumber in my state park
6331352 we have a moral obligation to maintain the integrity of chaco canyon
6331353 we dont need to be right up against their boundary
6331354 our preferred method is to exchange land and trade out of it because we dont want these conflicts
6331355 the international olympic committee themselves recognise that this is the last edition of a games which is going to look and feel like this
6331356 its a mistake to think that games model themselves on previous games every games ive been to has been very different
6331357 but we can be creative we know that more people will probably come to london for the games than to other cities
6331358 the days of just leaving 90 000 seater stadia particularly in london where youd have two with wembley are over
6331359 you have to provide something for local communities to do more than simply press their noses up against
6331360 a horrible history of marginalizing and freak a fying and a racist history but the coney island sideshow cost a dollar to get in and people went who would never go to the theater who would never see a post modern expos on gender it was a great part for me i would turn the thing upside down and go into a feminist rant and juggle knifes but there was always a banner on the outside that said bearded lady and that i hated that i was part of the freak show
6331361 im she im comfortable with she pronoun i can choose we all know whats comfortable gender god knows i dont know what that means anymore im sort of pondering my own internal sense of self in relation to my presentation although i am a woman with a beard i dont really identify as trans i see that i transgress traditional gender signifiers but i think the relationship of my beard to my gender identity is minimal
6331362 i identify as a director a performer a teacher why would i prioritize age over gender over race over class over the thing that i do over the color that i like over the food that i eat
6331363 hay muchas cosas que no me entran en la cabeza y una de ellas es c mo se aprovechan los medios de comunicaci n de una tragedia como la del avi n de barajas para atraer lectores o espectadores mediante el morbo
6331364 no es necesario verlos para saber que est n ah
6331365 nunca se me olvidar una imagen del 11 m que vi en una revista hace a os que mostraba un vag n reventado y el cad ver de una chica desfigurada sentada en uno de los asientos estoy seguro de que a sus familiares les encantar a tener esa foto en tama o p ster en el sal n
6331366 fue uno de los peores accidentes a reos en espa a del que por ahora no hay fotoperiodismo de primer plano mejor as que seg n los equipos de rescate y sanitarios el espect culo que soportaron fue dantesco el tremendo dolor de las familias es s lo de ellas y mejor no retratarlo que bastante tragedia tienen ahora mismo
6331367 senza di essi il mondo potrebbe non essere come lo conosciamo e amiamo oggi
6331368 shun the book shun the show send a message loud and clear
6331369 this is an historic case and i consider this his confession
6331370 setting up this new joint venture with boutique editions will enable threes a crowd to establish an international presence and open up new business opportunities
6331371 se exagereaz c nd se spune c nu putem f r mutu
6331372 era importanta victoria dar nici daca se termina egal nu era vreo problema
6331373 tell me and i will forget show me and i will remember
6331374 he can go faster you wont see nobody like him for another 50 years
6331375 i said im going to leave everything on the track
6331376 a multid o saiu correndo e ele o autor do disparo deve ter ido junto desceu todo mundo do carro
6331377 things most people cant even imagine owning let alone traveling with
6331378 but we always say if these bags could talk what a story they could tell
6331379 the fact that you have to drive just a little bit off the beaten path to get here makes it that much more intriguing
6331380 if we were in downtown nashville or downtown atlanta or downtown chicago we would just be another neat store it wouldnt be as mystical as it is here its very fortunate that its in the south because it allows us to showcase the beauty of our state the friendliness of the people and just what a great place we are its just our little corner of heaven up here i could not imagine us anywhere else its just who we are
6331381 when people travel they have the things they want so youre going to find your better items in personal luggage
6331382 thats part of what the treasure hunts about you just never know what youre going to find when you walk in the door
6331383 thats one of the things that surprises me the most the jewelry that people pack very expensive and exquisite items
6331384 my theory is if its not necessary and you cant wear it just dont take it lots of people have benefitted from what other people packed
6331385 we didnt know exactly what to expect and were shoppers the gold jewelry counter has been a hit weve been here 10 minutes and weve already spent 1 000
6331386 so we decided to pull down the online store and focus on the pictures we have and the stories we have so people can get a better understanding of what unclaimed baggage is all about and give them a little taste of wanting to make that trip to alabama
6331387 ucb has been the best thing thats happened to scottsboro in a long time
6331388 its just a great place the people there are very conscientious they want people to know about the area and they tell them what is around people like to come in here because its homey we tell them about the town and about the history of the house they love to hear the stories we love to converse with the people who come to unclaimed baggage you can normally tell who they are its special to them a lot of times they go home and then we get cards and letters from them saying what a wonderful time they had here
6331389 just 12 months after the acquisition of egl it is a pleasure to announce this solid set of results they are a credit to the hard work of all our employees in recent months we have realigned our organizational structure into four geographical regions in order to create a more customer focused and responsive structure we have also developed a very clear set of strategies and plans to shape the future direction of ceva our customers are reacting positively to these changes and we have experienced a number of significant wins during the quarter although trading conditions are challenging we believe that cevas current momentum will allow sustained progress
6331390 this years interims reflect continued strong progress across the groups business divisions which all performed well over the first half and i am very pleased to be able to report improved group profitability and a positive profit before tax and amortisation of intangibles
6331391 the momentum behind our 2007 merger is gaining pace and the breadth of solutions that we can provide puts us in a good position to benefit as our target publishing and information markets grow and expand these possibilities are underlined by several significant new service and product contracts signed or completed over the first half of this year these included a deal signed by the pcg division with bioone a leading us based aggregator of bioscience research journals which should add gbp0 5m to 2009 revenues and the launch of the world banks e library
6331392 we want to serve k citymarket customers with large selections and interesting new products which are also our means of differentiation in the market cooking and eating provide experiences in the middle of everyday routines which means that a beautiful table setting plays an increasingly important role
6331393 k citymarkets reach the target group of vivo products well and provide an important sales channel of home goods and tableware having vivo products sold by k citymarkets ensures nationwide availability in finland
6331394 every single important pollster has reported we have an apparent lead over the other candidate it is true we are winning
6331395 and unseat the man they couldnt remove through the ballot box

6331401 we cannot cure this problem ourselves we are a minuscule part of global emissions
6331402 for three of them the effect is fatal for another couple very likely so and these are fairly large effects
6331403 we do believe it provides an incentive to move to low emissions technology
6331404 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6331405 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6331406 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6331407 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6331408 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6331409 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6331410 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6331411 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6331412 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6331413 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6331414 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6331415 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6331416 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6331417 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6331418 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6331419 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6331420 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6331421 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6331422 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6331423 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6331424 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6331425 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6331426 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6331427 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6331428 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6331429 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6331430 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6331431 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6331432 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6331433 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6331434 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6331435 eww thats so nasty come on i have really good taste
6331436 its really been a significant year for wesfarmers with the acquisition of the coles group which was completed on the 23rd of november last year and in that time theres been a whole bunch of external challenges and im pleased with the way weve dealt with both things
6331437 notwithstanding the challenges of a tougher economic environment change in coles will gain momentum as work continues to fix the basics
6331438 the changes wont suddenly be obvious on a particular day or date but the results of progress made to date and the strategies being planned will deliver value to our shareholders and our customers
6331439 more customers into our stores and having them buy more product
6331440 the results are pleasing given a tightening economy and the varanus gas outage which curtailed our western australian energy and chemicals operations in june
6331441 while the economy is clearly not as bad as many people think perceptions are important and many people are exercising restraint until they get a better handle on their finances
6331442 it takes a worker on the average wage 31 8 weeks of earnings to buy a ford falcon xt sedan
6331443 the absolute irony is that the public library is a pillar of free speech and leads me to wonder why the administration is so upset its fiction
6331444 after working at a public library in a small rural midwestern town which i will refer to as denialville michigan thoughout this book for 15 years i have encountered strains and variations of crazy i didnt know existed in such significant portions of our population
6331445 the cover of your book includes a picture of the ludington library each chapter is devoted to a specific library patron or patrons your book portrays these people in a very unflattering manner you describe individual patrons as mentally ill mentally incompetent unintelligent and unattractive you label several as perverts while you stop short of naming the individuals you targeted in your book your detailed descriptions of their unique characteristics and mannerisms make them easily identifiable in our small community
6331446 most writers anyone who writes something some of its going to come from be rooted in your personal experience i dont think i could have come up with the characters on my own theyre bizarre idiosyncratic so they are based on some real experiences but of course there are embellishments
6331447 people who are unknown without charging the person thousands of dollars some self publishers charge
6331448 instead of taking pride in a local author we are criticizing her work of fiction what happened to free speech
6331449 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6331450 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6331451 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6331452 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6331453 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6331454 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6331455 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6331456 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6331457 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6331458 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6331459 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6331460 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6331461 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6331462 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6331463 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6331464 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6331465 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6331466 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6331467 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6331468 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6331469 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6331470 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6331471 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6331472 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6331473 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6331474 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6331475 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6331476 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6331477 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6331478 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6331479 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6331480 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6331481 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6331482 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

6331495 prison isnt a solution anymore they just form their own gangs inside prison and come out stronger
6331496 a spider web of corruption has penetrated many parts of our department
6331497 the town was very angry the truth is they wanted to beat me too
6331498 now operate in drug trafficking kidnapping and money laundering among other things with no central control nor any one gang dominating in any of the criminal activities that is why kidnapping has grown more competitive with kidnappers using much more violence against each other and against the victims in a bid to gain territory markets or dominance

6331503 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6331504 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6331505 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6331506 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6331507 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6331508 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6331509 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6331510 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6331511 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6331512 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6331513 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6331514 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6331515 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6331516 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6331517 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6331518 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6331519 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6331520 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6331521 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6331522 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6331523 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6331524 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6331525 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6331526 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6331527 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6331528 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6331529 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos

6331539 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6331540 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6331541 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6331542 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6331543 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6331544 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

6331548 the event was an important part of the osces work in assisting the kyrgyz ministries of justice and interior to reduce tensions in penitentiary and detention facilities and to prevent potential conflicts by taking into account the rights of detainees it also promoted increased access to detention facilities for public control purposes and partnership between police and civil society
6331549 this event contributes to enhancing confidence between law enforcement bodies and the public it will also help increase trust between police human rights defenders and international organizations and improve human rights protection in penitentiary facilities and conditions of detention

6331561 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6331562 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas

6331564 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6331565 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6331566 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6331567 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n

6331630 es ist nicht bedeutend und sowohl der umfang als auch das tempo des r ckzugs m ssen gr er werden und zwar besser fr her als sp ter
6331631 solche handlungen sch ren das misstrauen und f hren zu einem wettr sten in europa und dar ber hinaus
6331632 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6331633 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6331634 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6331635 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6331636 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6331637 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6331638 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6331639 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6331640 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6331641 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6331642 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6331643 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6331644 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6331645 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6331646 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6331647 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6331648 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6331649 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6331650 we dont value their aid projects and we dont think they are working for the progress of the country

6331659 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6331660 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e mails
6331661 its designed to make a copy of data at a specific point in time
6331662 data is backed up on a daily weekly and monthly basis as part of a disaster recovery strategy to ensure to protect the organization from data loss
6331663 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly 10 i can only take you so seriously
6331664 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6331665 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6331666 there is no comparison between the civil war and now
6331667 this is just a small group with no political reason to justify what they are doing we cannot reconcile with them the government needs to be firm and to reorganize its military and intelligence agencies
6331668 theyre using tactics from iraq and afghanistan theyre using the internet for recruiting and cell phones to explode bombs
6331669 theyre told by the government that a military crackdown is under way yet they cant believe what theyre seeing they say reconciliation attempts have done nothing theyre scared that the war of the 1990s will come back
6331670 even if this group is only 100 or 200 strong they can cause great damage and fear with five or 10 suicide bombers we have to ask why in 2008 some of our young people are going into these radical groups
6331671 these terrorist gangs are seeking through attacks against civilians to loosen the net closing around them as security forces drive them to the wall
6331672 but the whole civil society and politicians in all cities are condemning these acts which we think have links to international terrorists
6331673 these small groups have nothing to do with algerian politics
6331674 our ticket out of here was to develop iraqi security forces that has been accomplished
6331675 on a day to day basis very seldom do they actually need us
6331676 i believe i could walk out of here tomorrow and these guys would do okay
6331677 i cant refute the argument but im not going to go along with it either
6331678 the wounds still feel too fresh there are people there who have proven their willingness to use weapons to advance their cause
6331679 its also the case that when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6331680 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6331681 in this case russia will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic
6331682 we have achieved our main goals which means that our country and the united states will be more secure
6331683 after what happened in georgia i believe that this is good protection for us
6331684 made the americans agree to this deal sooner because the russians are getting too bossy
6331685 there is a growing public backlash against gordon browns regime of bin cuts over zealous bin fines and expensive new bin taxes yet labours answer is to bin local democracy and prevent the public from having any say i fear this will fuel public disillusionment with politics
6331686 this sets a dangerous constitutional precedent by having unelected unaccountable regional quangos impose direct taxation without direct representation
6331687 throughout the course of the day and into this evening congresswoman tubbs jones medical condition declined
6331688 over the course of many years with many ups and many downs stephanie was right by our side unwavering indefatigable
6331689 it was that fighting spirit that allowed stephanie to rise from modest beginnings to succeed in public service to become a one woman force for progress in our country
6331690 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6331691 she worked so hard and gave everything she could im devastated wherever wed go wed speak of each other as brother and sister its an incalculable loss
6331692 punched a clock day in and day out one as a skycap the other as a factory worker
6331693 welcome to your city name here virtual host of the 2012 republican convention
6331694 one of the major concerns for us is and your public auditor coined the phrase
6331695 they wanted the actual site map as to where the buildings would properly size the property and once thats accomplished i think the transfer of property from one entity to another would begin and then we can start building on that too
6331696 ich will nicht anma end klingen aber es gab einen gro en territorialen konflikt bei der gr ndung der nato der hie ost deutschland
6331697 und wir haben westdeutschland deswegen nicht daran gehindert der nato beizutreten
6331698 schlie lich hat deutschland in der nato nicht nur seine teilung berwunden sondern auch durch demokratischen frieden seine sehr schwierige geschichte mit den nachbarn
6331699 wir m ssen uns an diese geschichte erinnern wenn wir ber die territorialen probleme georgiens reden
6331700 georgien wird wenn es das will mitglied der nato werden
6331701 l nder die selbst in regionale oder innere konflikte verstrickt sind k nnen aus meiner sicht nicht mitglieder der nato sein wir sind ein b ndnis zur verteidigung der sicherheit und keines in dem einzelne mitglieder noch mit ihrer eigenen sicherheit zu tun haben
6331702 as you get older the vaccine becomes less cost effective
6331703 weve had reports of people having 3 to 5 feet of water in their home
6331704 in the instance of mr klitzkie attorney klitzkie he was contracted with the court for a period of six months to handle all of the cases that were assigned to then judge katherine maraman who was elevated and ascended up to the supreme court and he was tapped to be a pro tem simply because we did not want to have a backlog of cases at the trial court
6331705 we are just very anxious today by the smiles of the children and the parents and the teachers and staff
6331706 i dont have my full complement of school aides im lacking four more school aides i have a total of seven today
6331707 right now we just have a turn lane im just not too sure how safe that will be so i still hope dpw will reconsider and perhaps put a traffic light up in front
6331708 many of them are happy to be back in school they like the fact that the school is entirely air conditioned its nice and clean and they feel good about it
6331709 i know there were many doubters and critics but to be here at this day recognizing that there were so many people behind this and much support along the way i just want to see the kids and thats all the gratitude i need

6331716 the summons dies with the dissolution of parliament for an election
6331717 thats the only thing that can stop us because we are bound and determined to drag all these senior conservatives before the committee and its going to be embarrassing
6331718 it certainly contradicts the spirit of the fixed election date laws to manipulate the election date to avoid embarrassment maybe they figured better to take one or two days of bad headlines than risk genuinely damaging testimony and if theyre going to pack up parliament anyway then theyre scot free
6331719 thats not to say that a small butcher cant make mistakes but at best hes going to kill off a few of his neighbours when you take that same mistake and you put it into a plant that serves millions the risk is vastly expanded
6331720 shift from full time cfia meat inspection presence to an oversight role allowing industry to implement food safety control programs and to manage key risks
6331721 with the steady growth of mobile internet adoption and easier ways to access the internet and digital media archos is delivering a fast uncompromised web browsing and entertainment experience on a portable device
6331722 the internet media tablet redefines media on the move and for the first time gives consumers the ability to be connected 24 7 with a pc like experience in the palm of their hand the imts not only provide true web browsing but also let people store and enjoy their entire media collections and tv anywhere and everywhere
6331723 if anyone knows why these two should not be married speak no or forever hold your peace
6331724 a liberal government will reinstate all those programs and canadians will have a true structural vision of what culture should be for our country
6331725 the conservatives are spending a lot on the creation side but the whole point with trade routes in the first place was whats the point in creating all this content if it isnt seen with a small amount of money we were able to maximize what we were already spending which was not insignificant
6331726 you would have an embassy presence and a calendar of events in the major capitals around the world and in just about every country something would be happening culturally for canada by canadians
6331727 the canada council shouldnt have to replicate every embassy and thats what trade routes did otherwise when the canada council goes knocking on the door of the minister of foreign affairs in paris theyre not going to get too far
6331728 it does seem like we shoot ourselves in the foot weve spent years building up a canadian presence abroad and there are industries and countries that are poised to actually see returns on that it would be nice to have a dialogue to know exactly what the thinking is because it seems shortsighted

6331739 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6331740 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6331741 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited
6331742 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s

6331745 bouwen zodat de gemeente jongeren ouderen en bedrijven kan huisvesten edam volendam is geen stille woongemeente maar een dynamische gemeente waar het prettig wonen is het cda wil een gemeente die waar voor zijn geld biedt niet de goedkoopste niet de duurste maar de beste gemeente een gemeente met een hoog voorzieningenniveau een gemeente waar iedereen erbij hoort jong of oud ziek of gezond rijk of arm het mag geen verschil maken en een gemeente waarin de lokale bevolking kan blijven wonen en werken voor zover de wet het ons mogelijk maakt reserveren wij woningbouw in de eerste plaats voor eigen inwoners het cda is van mening dat dit van bijzonder belang is voor de sociale cohesie binnen onze gemeente
6331746 this issue has been going on for over four years and i got a good feel from the community over that time about what they wanted
6331747 valid and subsisting charitable trust that requires the city to use the subject properties for municipal purposes and not for commercial or industrial purposes and which prohibits the city from selling the properties
6331748 its very curious that the council is arguing against a court ruling that says the land is to stay in trust for municipal use there is certainly speculation in the community about what the council had in mind
6331749 ancillary commercial uses on this property have been going on for 50 or 60 years nobody is challenging that and the ruling didnt either theyve been selling hot dogs and sharpening skates for many years
6331750 when a party gives land to a municipality and then enters into conditions or covenants its an important fact because the citizens of any municipality of any province are the benefactors of the gift
6331751 if a government then ignores the conditions the trust and the agreements then shame on the government in question
6331752 obviously we were not happy they didnt move faster to clean up the adjacent properties
6331753 theyre coming out saying come for lunch come for lunch
6331754 i think what needs to be reviewed is whether you should have an agency overseeing these really important functions
6331755 its been like hitting your head against the wall you cant get long standing zoning altered without significant provincial input
6331756 lets figure out exactly what went wrong before we act precipitously
6331757 i am very concerned that mr mcguinty just says dont worry the investigation will be over soon enough well do something in due course and people are expected to twist in the wind in the meantime
6331758 would help to level the playing field for general elections
6331759 nothing in this section affects the powers of the governor general including the power to dissolve parliament at the discretion
6331760 will live by the law and the spirit of this particular piece of legislation
6331761 the government is clear that it will not be seeking an early election at any time parliament can defeat the government and provoke an early election if that is what the opposition irresponsibly chooses to do
6331762 if parliament was not functioning well that would show a lack of confidence in the government its a no brainer that wed have to go to the people to try and settle it
6331763 im going to have to make a judgment in the next little while as to whether or not this parliament can function productively
6331764 says he doesnt support the government but wont say you know whether he will defeat us or not i dont think thats a tenable situation

6331775 this is a rewarding validation of our unique approach to caring for poor seniors
6331776 weve helped the poorest and oldest individuals to live independently while giving their caregivers peace of mind
6331777 seniors shouldnt be forced out of their homes because americas health care system is broken
6331778 senior whole healths commitment to providing home care makes sense for the consumer and the community
6331779 the demographic shift of the boomers using medicare and medicaid will most likely position senior whole health for continued growth in the foreseeable future
6331780 senior whole healths business model will help to seek out and deliver vital resources to a hard to reach population living in massachusetts and across the nation
6331781 as the original sponsor of the law that led to the creation of so called sco programs such as senior whole health i am delighted with the success that this program has achieved
6331782 senior whole health helps frail elders stay in their homes by providing the medical and social supports that are critical they save the taxpayers money and improve the quality of life for the citizens they serve the gold standard for any publicly supported program

6331790 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6331791 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6331792 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6331793 both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in iraq
6331794 been law for eight years now and taxpayers are used to those rates
6331795 allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase
6331796 is there a restaurant in this city more beloved than gramercy tavern

6331800 dont do it d we can make something bigger happen
6331801 even without an individualized explanation of how the provision would affect their benefits notice of the provision could have induced the employees to increase savings in other retirement vehicles or to consider other employment
6331802 that means that the old pre conversion plan remains in effect which would be the best thing possible for the older employees
6331803 we look forward to showing the court our side of this argument
6331804 and it allows companies to provide transition benefits to employees which is the most generous thing an employer can do in a conversion

6331843 the virus just act as a matrix or scaffold to catalyze grow and arrange materials the virus are not active as a biological material

6331891 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
6331892 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
6331893 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
6331894 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
6331895 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
6331896 the scientific community is really going to run with this
6331897 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science

6331901 no wealth of gold and silver can purchase a keen mind but the man of wit will often find treasures beyond what mere lucre can provide
6331902 friendlies are a bit different but it was good to be playing centre back it was only my second time for northern ireland
6331903 we were here to do a job and its a good platform to take into the qualifiers going away from home and keeping a clean sheet if that was a qualifying match we would have got a valuable point
6331904 you always get the work rate with northern ireland but with that system we worked really really hard
6331905 with david healy playing up on his own he worked his socks off i dont think he has that much match fitness so it was a credit to him
6331906 its unfortunate he missed the penalty but he has got that many goals for northern ireland i dont think it matters
6331907 we have got to give them respect but we must go into their backyard like we did in scotlands and perform like we did
6331908 if we do that we can get a good result there is a lot of hard work to be done we got turned over in latvia and iceland by these supposedly smaller nations
6331909 if we get four to six points away from home in the next qualifiers i will be very happy as long as we keep our home form
6331910 that is my first clean sheet as northern ireland manager and if you can get clean sheets you can build on that
6331911 cemex believes the confiscation and subsequent start of the expropriation process is a flagrant violation of the constitution law of expropriation and other laws of venezuela
6331912 cemex also believes the venezuelan governments actions highlight a lack of respect for the principles of international law and the treaties relating to reciprocal protection of investments which forbid the occupation of goods and deprivation of rights without fair and effective compensation and without an expropriation procedure
6331913 i loved going to new york and buying the fabrics and finding new things my big passion is for fabrics and color oh i miss it every day
6331914 theres a world in washington that is gone and she was part of it
6331915 she was very much aware of what ones responsibilities were in the world she accepted those responsibilities she made choices and she saw them to completion
6331916 but at this stage i dont really consider myself a jazz musician
6331917 i have plenty of space to improvise to try new ideas
6331918 the greatest use of life is to spend it for something that will outlast it
6331919 we zullen grote risicos moeten nemen het is alles of niets we willen hoe dan ook een medaille winnen
6331920 we hadden echter wel veel vertrouwen in onze zeilers en op de manier waarop ze zich op het olympisch toernooi hebben voorbereid de ynglingvrouwen en de 470 zeilsters hebben hier gepiekt en ook de costers hebben het uitstekend gedaan helaas zonder de verdiende beloning in de vorm van een medaille
6331921 dat impliceert namelijk dat mensen die het niet halen medeschuldig zijn aan hun eigen dood
6331922 toen ik destijds aangaf dat ik wilde laten zien dat je na kanker nog wereldkampioen kunt worden wist ik niet precies wat dat inhield en of ik het echt zou kunnen
6331923 ik was geplaatst voor peking dus ik kon zonder enige druk meepeddelen op de 25 kilometer toevallig werd het een beetje mijn race de laatste duizend meter besefte ik ineens dat als ik ooit nog eens wereldkampioen wilde worden dat dit mijn kans zou zijn
6331924 we lagen in een groepje ik ben de snelste sprinter ik dacht als ik dit sprintje niet win ga ik mijn leven lang hier aan terugdenken dat vond ik zon vreselijke gedachte dat er in plaats van motivatie ook een soort angst kwam maar ik heb gelukkig mijn hoofd koel gehouden
6331925 die ervaring met een groepje eindigen en de laatste tweehonderd meter sprinten gaat me straks zeker helpen
6331926 ik heb mij in 2004 en 2005 erg ingezet voor kwf kankerbestrijding ik heb een eigen stichting gehad maar dat kostte zoveel energie en tijd ik heb toen besloten dat ik dat beter iets rustiger aan kon doen en mij beter op het zwemmen kon concentreren als ik mijn verhaal wil vertellen dan heb ik meer aan een sportieve prestatie dan zoveel mogelijk op televisie komen
6331927 ik mag daar ook gebruik maken van alle mensen die pieter om zich heen heeft waardoor het allemaal een stukje professioneler is geworden dat heeft zijn vruchten afgeworpen
6331928 op de eerste plaats moeten mensen weten dat kanker lang niet altijd het einde betekent men schat de genezingskans altijd veel lager in dan die in werkelijkheid is dat komt omdat mensen het altijd te horen krijgen als iemand aan kanker is overleden maar 53 procent van de mensen die kanker krijgen is er na vijf jaar nog ik wil laten zien dat je daarna nog ontzettend veel kunt
6331929 armstrong beschrijft zijn gevecht hoe hij knokte hoe hij voelde dat hij kankercellen uitkotste
6331930 daarmee zeg je bijna dat het je eigen schuld is als je het niet haalt dat je niet hard genoeg hebt gevochten dat voelt als bedrog naar mijn maatjes destijds in het ziekenhuis die het niet haalden

6331932 while negotiations are ongoing with time warner it appears very unlikely that an agreement will be reached before the first game of the year and anything beyond that is problematic
6331933 time warners decision not to carry the network is a huge disappointment
6331934 theres no stalemate or breakdown in discussions as smiths letter would have our customers believe
6331935 on the contrary talks are moving in the right direction

6331937 welcome to your city name here virtual host of the 2012 republican convention
6331938 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6331939 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6331940 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6331941 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6331942 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6331943 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6331944 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6331945 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6331946 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6331947 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6331948 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6331949 we dont know what went on between mclaughlin and seamus oneill that caused mclaughlin to beat him to death with a baseball bat
6331950 my baby never been in trouble let alone part of something like this my baby wasnt even allowed to play with toy guns everyone is saying theyre shocked im just as shocked as everyone else
6331951 he dont even know where the gun shop is at
6331952 these guys totally took my baby out of the neighborhood for people to keep passing judgment they dont even know him
6331953 he wanted to be president and he wanted to be a basketball player
6331954 he said he dont ever want no friends again ever
6331955 he doesnt even want to go outside they had to manipulate him he is only 11 hes a sweet boy
6331956 it had to be because aint no way in the world theyre going to go through something like that on their own
6331957 his arms and legs were bound with duct tape behind his back
6331958 we are losing one of the best young boys in our community
6331959 it is heartbreaking i feel as though i lost my own child
6331960 this has happened in at least five stores in our community
6331961 the bulk of the conversation was about public safety and violence in their neighborhoods
6331962 if i had any of my own i would want them to be like him
6331963 its so sad and so unfair because he didnt deserve that
6331964 we took a lot of bad people off the streets today
6331965 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6331966 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6331967 a developing foetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems
6331968 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that
6331969 i had no direct knowledge and no direct participation in the recent care of the patients in question patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility
6331970 chronicles the dramatic unscripted real life experiences of a group of celebrities as they make the life changing decision to enter a treatment program
6331971 somehow supplied or facilitated contraband prescription medications soma and norco resulting in a medication overdose
6331972 they would check on alex through the course of the night
6331973 we will replace batteries of the first generation ipod nanos with new ones if customers find that the batteries overheat
6331974 we are still investigating the cause of the glitch but weve identified one particular supplier of the batteries
6331975 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6331976 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6331977 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6331978 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6331979 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6331980 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6331981 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6331982 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6331983 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6331984 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6331985 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6331986 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6331987 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6331988 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6331989 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6331990 well you know my name is simon and the things i draw come true
6331991 well make believe well play sambas in our hotel room
6331992 certainly he was quite serious with his efforts to engage in sex acts with a minor
6331993 im not a collector i want the real taste let me call you
6331994 i want to hear your girlish voice telling me what to do
6331995 i dont think this investigation would ever have started without christian marrone
6331996 prior to the federal governments involvement i think he provided information that found its way to the inquirer that produced a multitude of stories that i think got the attention of the federal authorities i do believe without christians involvement in providing that information it would never have gotten to where it is today
6331997 i dont see any purpose in talking about the trial or vince at this point
6331998 totally baseless and ridiculous its completely desperate and runs counter to the facts at hand facts are stubborn things and the truth will come out
6331999 and i want them to know while they may not have always come first because of my public service for the rest of my life they will always come first
6332000 but it was evident when marrone worked for us that he absolutely hated senator fumo he was constantly bashing the senator
6332001 were going to have to cut more or were going to have to tighten our belts even more so tougher decisions are going to have to be made
6332002 there has to be some give somewhere in order to do that and thats an ongoing conversation
6332003 ive never worked for a government or public entity that explicitly put money for raises in the budget
6332004 that would certainly be my fantasy i dont know that that is going to happen
6332005 thats what we would like to see happen now we have to work with the pft and the other unions to see if we can make that happen
6332006 we want to do a financial plan that strategically looks over five years and includes costs for raises but that cant happen unless we look at some of this give and take
6332007 when asked about an hbcu she had no knowledge of what it was this is a major problem when 75 percent of graduating classes attend hbcus
6332008 i need to talk to the principal to see if it was a personnel issue or a fiscal issue
6332009 dr pitre will be in charge of all the academic functions of the school system that support regions schools and classrooms
6332010 i was so proud of myself because now everyone has had the opportunity to say goodbye properly
6332011 i feel like i have said everything too and if i died tomorrow it would be sad but there would be no regrets
6332012 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6332013 determined to get over this disease and reclaim my normal life as quickly as possible
6332014 i have a confession to make with a few exceptions i generally loathe blogs whos really interested in a pet cat someone buying new shoes or top tips on how to plant potatoes
6332015 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6332016 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6332017 i had this overwhelming sense of panic and deep breathing it was so strange
6332018 she wasnt doing anything threatening me with a wedgie or a chinese burn
6332019 i firmly believe that if our young adults are given all the facts about these important issues many more will go on to become donors themselves
6332020 true hero whose selflessness and courage made him an inspiration to all who knew him and to many who didnt
6332021 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6332022 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6332023 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6332024 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6332025 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6332026 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6332027 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6332028 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6332029 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6332030 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6332031 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6332032 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6332033 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6332034 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6332035 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6332036 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6332037 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6332038 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6332039 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6332040 im not happy that weve spent as much money as we have on legal fees but i want to be very careful moving forward
6332041 i still dont quite understand how having a bunch of books in the basement qualifies
6332042 we have a number of guys in recovery from sexual addiction who may have some interest in this sort of thing
6332043 a small group of anti pornography zealots who pressure government which exposes their county and fellow taxpayers to potential economic loss
6332044 e lungi dal diminuire questo numero in realt in aumento alla media di quattro milioni lanno
6332045 i leader dei 185 paesi che partecipavano al vertice in quelloccasione hanno definito la fame nel mondo
6332046 e mi rincresce dire che oggi la situazione continua a rimanere intollerabile ed inaccettabile e forse anche di pi perch nel frattempo sono trascorsi dieci anni
6332047 questo significa che il mondo sulla buona strada per il raggiungimento dellobiettivo di sviluppo del millennio sulla riduzione della fame
6332048 il compito che la regione si trova di fronte immane
6332049 dobbiamo intensificare ed in modo rilevante il nostro impegno per raggiungere la riduzione della fame proclamata dal vertice dellalimentazione se vi la volont politica possiamo riuscirci
6332050 asked me to let you know that he will not be returning to philadelphia when his term as governor is over
6332051 it seems with city council banning trans fat in philadelphia the governor feels there really is no reason for him
6332052 its not like i killed somebody i never did anything like that
6332053 why attack me that got news media in courtroom that paints a picture like im a monster
6332054 that video is contrary to any notion as to how people should approach dealing with law enforcement
6332055 i was reading a script and holding a camera and basically laughing through the whole dvd
6332056 if im wrong for reading a script then all of hollywood is wrong
6332057 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
6332058 we dont have the details yet to know if these cases are in jeopardy so i cant speak on that publicly yet
6332059 i was there 12 years and never had any issues
6332060 thats good personnel in there and they should not be knocked for everything i think the criticism is blown out of proportion
6332061 its a uniformly standard practice of laboratories doing dna testing
6332062 fewer than 15 known incidents of staff contamination over seven years isnt the kind of thing that holds up lab operations
6332063 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6332064 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6332065 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6332066 at this stage were waiting for formal identification procedures to take place before we take the matter any further
6332067 it may have been snagged it may have been under water for a period of time and with the recent rain has just been brought to the surface its probable hes washed down from further up
6332068 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6332069 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6332070 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6332071 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6332072 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6332073 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6332074 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6332075 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6332076 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6332077 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6332078 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6332079 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6332080 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6332081 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6332082 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6332083 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6332084 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6332085 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6332086 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6332087 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6332088 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6332089 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6332090 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6332091 ad aprire questa settima edizione il 4 settembre il ritorno di raffinati artisti dal talento straordinario fondatori della compagnia franco canadese
6332092 ole si la feura doliera vos ya estar as encamada
6332093 bueno por lo menos me voy a cambiar los aretes me pongo unos m s bonitos y m s grandes que distraigan la atenci n de esta cara de sobreviviente del holocausto que me cargo hoy
6332094 hoy es un d a de inmensa tristeza para madrid y todos los espa oles
6332095 hoy es un d a de profunda tristeza y desgarro para madrid
6332096 this storm is turning into a serious catastrophic flooding event particularly in southern brevard county
6332097 a liberal government will reinstate all those programs and canadians will have a true structural vision of what culture should be for our country
6332098 the conservatives are spending a lot on the creation side but the whole point with trade routes in the first place was whats the point in creating all this content if it isnt seen with a small amount of money we were able to maximize what we were already spending which was not insignificant
6332099 you would have an embassy presence and a calendar of events in the major capitals around the world and in just about every country something would be happening culturally for canada by canadians
6332100 the canada council shouldnt have to replicate every embassy and thats what trade routes did otherwise when the canada council goes knocking on the door of the minister of foreign affairs in paris theyre not going to get too far
6332101 it does seem like we shoot ourselves in the foot weve spent years building up a canadian presence abroad and there are industries and countries that are poised to actually see returns on that it would be nice to have a dialogue to know exactly what the thinking is because it seems shortsighted
6332102 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
6332103 all complaints should be immediately examined in accordance with the law
6332104 a smart look at politics pop culture and all the days top stories
6332105 its a political trip its not like a mayors conference its a party conference
6332106 as long as theyre doing their jobs and are not involved in politics its more than appropriate
6332107 i think it was clear to just about everybody but the mayor that this was an expense that should be paid by his campaign funds
6332108 its clearly a political event hes going for political reasons hes bringing people to enhance his image for political reasons
6332109 i tend to eat on my own and pay for my own meals
6332110 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6332111 this is a planning took where all things are going
6332112 im not saying brandon is a saint but i cant see him taking an officer in uniform
6332113 when i heard gunshots my high wore off very quickly
6332114 how many libertarians does it take to screw in a lightbulb
6332115 none they sit back and let the free market take care of it
6332116 but i have a good feeling that any day now tom knox former mayoral candidate and millionaire is going to adopt me
6332117 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6332118 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6332119 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6332120 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6332121 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6332122 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6332123 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6332124 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6332125 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6332126 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6332127 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6332128 we dont know why that will be part of the investigation
6332129 anytime they compromise the skin of the fruit it becomes illegal
6332130 we issue peddlers licenses but they are only allowed to sell whole uncut fruit
6332131 and we have mobile food dispenser licenses for prepared foods but they require that the food has been prepared in a licensed kitchen first
6332132 the spanish team which obtained the silver medal and the italian team which was ranked fourth as well as the race committee filed various protests which were all rejected by the isaf international jury
6332133 the two nocs request the cas to annul the isaf international jury decisions to declare that the danish team was not entitled to take part in the gold medal race to disqualify the danish team and to re allocate the olympic medals to the spanish team gold medal to the german team silver medal and to the italian team bronze medal
6332134 cas has promised to send the documents to us today
6332135 sieben soldaten haben mich vergewaltigt und dabei schwer verletzt jetzt l uft wegen eines risses zwischen blase und vagina st ndig urin aus meinem k rper
6332136 die installation zeigt in erschreckender weise welchen grausamkeiten frauen in vielen krisen und kriegsgebieten wehrlos ausgesetzt sind damit d rfen wir uns nicht abfinden wir m ssen weltweit politischen druck auf die verantwortlichen aus ben damit diese menschenrechtsverletzungen endlich ein ende haben
6332137 ich lebe in einem sicheren und reichen erste welt land und es geht mir gut doch f r viele frauen und m dchen sind kriegsvergewaltigungen immer noch traurige realit t daher will ich ihnen eine stimme geben deswegen unterst tze ich medica mondiale
6332138 es ist wichtig dass sich medica mondiale um frauen k mmert die im krieg opfer von vergewaltigungen geworden sind ich unterst tze diese arbeit und w rde mich freuen wenn sie dabei w ren
6332139 frauen in kriegs und krisengebieten brauchen sicherheit vor gewalt und unterst tzung um mit ihren erlebnissen weiterleben zu k nnen aber sie brauchen unbedingt auch gerechtigkeit die chance auf genugtuung weil das ihr leiden ffentlich anerkennt und offiziell deutlich macht dass nicht sie die verantwortung f r eine vergewaltigung tragen wie das leider in vielen gesellschaften geschieht sondern m nner wie karad ic
6332140 i also want to thank the fact that youre here tonight despite the weather tropical storm fay is set a challenge for this convention but your members were wise enough to hang around i do want to thank the officials of the state of florida for working hard to make sure people were ready to address the storm
6332141 theres not going to be an xbox 720 or a ps4 ill make that bet
6332142 the investment they made in creating the xbox 360 and the ps3 is so vast in the scale of billions that no amount of games that they sell in the consoles lifetime will ever make them profitable
6332143 they may be profitable on a quarterly basis today but theyll never recover the losses they put into those platforms nintendo is the only one making any money and they are the ones with the cheap console
6332144 the market will be dominated by online community based games by 2020 the pc will be the dominant platform
6332145 it will be monetised by microcurrency advertising and subscriptions and you probably wont see another generation of consoles because there will not be the economics to justify the investment
6332146 when they are old enough theyll decide to live with me
6332147 when they turn 18 theyll come over to my house
6332148 your father loves you and misses you and hes not seeing you because i wont allow it
6332149 i was not at the scene when the incident took place
6332150 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6332151 vision of what the future holds for the next five to ten years
6332152 may inform the development of conservative party policy in this area
6332153 the review will be published as an independent review and then it will be for the conservative party to decide whether to adopt some or all of the policy recommendations
6332154 the letter has been circulated to all royal colleges academic units anyone who has expressed an interest and that includes the readers of e health insider
6332155 in particular we are aware of the benefits to be gained from patient centred records
6332156 we believe that such records appropriately designed properly implemented and made available to those providing health and where feasible social care would enable the improvement and efficient management of patient and service user outcomes
6332157 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6332158 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6332159 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6332160 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6332161 there were a lot of people who respected each other on both sides of the issue unfortunately it had a sad ending
6332162 but with a reconstituted board and some new members hopefully we can put the hospital system and the medical school back on track
6332163 deteriorated to a point where the future of both institutions is jeopardized
6332164 the governor has made appointments that he believes will serve the long term interests of the medical system and the doctors researchers students and support staff that have made the university of maryland medical system what it is today
6332165 when you pass that decision to someone in annapolis i dont think thats the best process
6332166 if you look at the history of medical systems across the country a huge number of failures come from a lack of independence on how you allocate capital
6332167 i feel southern cooking is the most interesting and probably truest american cuisine in terms of freedom from european influences
6332168 a fair or proper equivalent in money commodities etc for something sold or exchanged
6332169 consumers want to feel that their dinner experience is a good value regardless of the price point
6332170 the goal is to give these young dancers a positive experience
6332171 they get to work with the best piano accompanists they are taught choreography from a living choreographer and they receive personal coaching in the classics in short they learn the life skills crucial to a dancer about to begin a professional career the interpretation of choreography through the collaboration between music and movement
6332172 over the years weve seen the participants become taller and more athletic
6332173 weve seen the doors of the profession open for them but important things happen on a personal level as well we watch these young people being so supportive of each other and making friends for life
6332174 he just knew how to talk to people and he treated people with compassion
6332175 finally i got a phone call on monday from alease that said jermaine hadnt come home all weekend and this went on for 12 days
6332176 i just kept looking and looking and looking and i couldnt find him
6332177 when they pulled the body out of the river everything just went woosh
6332178 i guess its just a mothers instinct and a feeling that i knew it was my child
6332179 he was not injured in any way so it did not appear that he had been beaten
6332180 he was not shot stabbed or strangled or anything like that
6332181 he said he was trying to clean himself back up again
6332182 nobody had talked to him nobody had seen him on the streets anywhere
6332183 ive just been stressed and depressed every day trying to figure out what happened and why and who did it
6332184 thats one of the theories that they robbed him for his coat
6332185 at this point based on the stories that weve heard he was most likely robbed on that bridge and he was either jumped or was pushed in as a result of that robbery
6332186 i just want to come to a closure because 11 and a half years is too long for people to know what happened and not to come forth or tell anything
6332187 words cant even say how much i miss my brother said dave pope jermaines only brother
6332188 i mean that was my heart i think about him every day i think about how things would be if he were still here
6332189 all i can do is pray im sure god has a plan and this may be the right time
6332190 we have a gut feeling that some of those leads are going to pan out for us
6332191 we hope that we can bring it to a conclusion and hopefully arrest someone in this case
6332192 jermaine has not rested this whole time and hes not going to rest until its solved
6332193 when students have positive caring nurturing and supportive relationships with their teachers classroom problems decrease
6332194 african americans have an attitude that says when you respect me i will respect you
6332195 the less we know about each other the more we make up

6332236 we have no information about the whereabouts of the truckers and the conductors of the vehicle torched by the mob even we have no information about the other two trucks
6332237 at least 50 kashmiri trucks which were on way to kashmir from delhi are stuck on the highway since early tuesday morning we were stopped by police and asked to wait for orders they allowed the vehicles from punjab and jammu but arrested us a group of rioters attacked us and injured 20 truckers and conductors late afternoon

6332242 the policemen only acted after seeing the rioters trying to lynch the drivers

6332288 using language that is obscene offensive or of a seriously insulting nature to another player umpire referee team official or spectator
6332289 i accept that in international cricket there is a lot of passion but that does not excuse players talking back to umpires in an aggressive manner as happened in this case
6332290 that is unacceptable and i hope this decision and the fine imposed demonstrates that fact
6332291 its brilliant its great news for us and all the players and were looking forward to the tournament
6332292 its a good way for us to develop our game its also a chance for us to develop the game in scotland

6332356 proper management of data quality is even more critical in the context of application interoperability because open source considerably lowers the barriers of entry many organizations will be able to reap the benefits

6332376 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6332377 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6332378 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6332379 why is it beyond the wit of our country to be able to provide the resources and encouragement in supporting australians who are unemployed to go to areas where they can get seasonal work

6332416 desafortunadamente cuando mejor jug bamos ellos hicieron el gol eso an micamente nos cost much simo nos cost remontar pero al final los tres puntos son importantes es ganar en casa es empezar con el pie derecho y en este tipo de eliminatorias es muy valioso

6332437 imports are surging in value which shows that high crude oil prices continue to hurt companies revenues and are leading to an outflow of income from japan
6332438 i dont think theres any doubt the major major issue is water and can be as important as oil so the compact that is in effect obviously needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties i think that theres a movement amongst the governors to try if not quote renegotiate certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth of greater demands on a scarcer resource
6332439 the compact is the only protection colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu
6332440 i wonder if he is running for president of the united states or for something in arizona when he makes those statements

6332518 i was delirious but the stretcher at the end was a bit mad i just wanted to lie down and have a sleep
6332519 are you better off than you were four years ago are you better off than you were eight years ago
6332520 well then why the heck would you want to do the same thing
6332521 youd think that things are so bad that the economys in such bad shape that we might not even have to campaign
6332522 but the truth is that john mccain is a decorated war hero and the republican party hasnt been very good at governing but theyre very good at running negative ads
6332523 hes making these decisions not because he doesnt love america but because he doesnt think it matters whether america wins or loses
6332524 let me be clear that i do not advocate renegotiation of the compact

6332530 i have one race to go i have to refocus again to get one more gold medal
6332531 i dont want to say anything too serious because my coach might want me to run 400 meters
6332532 anything is possible if i put my mind to it im not worried about that now dont hold your breath i dont think ill be going up to the 400 anytime soon
6332533 the 200 has been my love since i was 15
6332534 i was the youngest ever to win world juniors it means a lot to me its dear to my heart the 200 means more to me than the 100
6332535 i wont compare myself to michael phelps to win eight gold medals thats great im on the track and hes in the water you cant compare the two
6332536 theres nothing on the roads before the race was run
6332537 he ran 52 flat for the 400 on a grass track
6332538 i got up at 12 my masseuse brought me nuggets of course im serious i didnt want to go to the cafeteria i went straight to the track and my masseuse brought me more nuggets
6332539 i thought he robbed us of another great performance in the 100 because i thought he could run 9 50
6332540 im so pleased i thought if he runs if he truly runs this is his olympic games its magical none of us thought world record i thought 19 55 19 52
6332541 i assume his first 100 had to be faster than michael
6332542 a 6 5 sprinter with cat like feet and the turnover to match the smaller guys if he has the same tempo and takes nine foot strides its ridiculous you just cant match it
6332543 hes bad he broke the 100 meter record the 200 meter record
6332544 im serious hes bad the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6332545 the only reason the project was turned down was through visual impact so we have addresses that directly
6332546 the buildings have been reduced in height by around three metres which is a significant drop in height

6332550 now that the president is out of the picture there can be no more dilly dallying
6332551 but the legislature is a collection of competing political forces that for most of their history have engaged in zero sum games

6332557 voted down a bill to protect live born survivors of abortion even after the panel had amended the bill to contain verbatim language copied from a federal bill passed by congress without objection in 2002 explicitly foreclosing any impact on abortion
6332558 inasmuch as youve done it unto the least of these you have also done it unto me
6332559 i happen to be in the kingdom of god my kingdom is not of this world and sometimes when people dont understand that they want you to be on their political bandwagon
6332560 though this milestone is imminent it is difficult to believe that it has already occurred
6332561 no other source claims to have confirmed this event and in fact the ofcom statements do not really say it either
6332562 the fact that mccain is a westerner from a nearby state will be offset by the democratic mood of the nation thereby making the race really competitive in the west
6332563 if obamas able to win in these states it will have more to do with national trends against the republican party manifesting themselves than with political and demographic changes on the ground
6332564 that national shift has to be great enough to upset the historical pattern of these states tending to vote republican for president
6332565 this has been a difficult year for most of us in many different ways
6332566 the votes going to be tight theres no denying that
6332567 i really think there are enough people who i dont want to say fear barack obama but just dont know him and will end up voting for mccain
6332568 hes focused about the workers and what he wants for our future
6332569 the markets will remain more or less range bound we will have to wait for some incremental news which would give the markets some trigger
6332570 in the next 6 12 months inflation would drop because of a decline in commodities prices so going forward i think the markets would look up in the medium term
6332571 they say they hate coming here because there is nothing to do but there is a lot to do now and there is going to be a lot more
6332572 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

6332594 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6332595 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6332596 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6332597 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now

6332604 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6332605 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6332606 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent
6332607 and hopefully voters will give us a chance to improve facilities by voting in favor of a bond issue
6332608 there are still a couple of issues that were wrestling with but that 135 million figure is correct as of the end of wednesday afternoon
6332609 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6332610 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6332611 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6332612 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product

6332619 there are no cars on the road during bolts races
6332620 its like a ghost town everybody is in front of the tv or in a bar or something every single baby from the youngest to the oldest theyre saying run man run we love our heroes
6332621 its euphoria in jamaica right now its like magic its crazy everywhere we put up big screens in the squares and in the districts people are watching from the streets of kingston to trelawny parish they are all over its unbelievable
6332622 people are justified to ask questions i can only answer as true as i can usain is clean he is a phenomenon someone like him comes along once a century
6332623 the thing that impacts a cards value more than anything else is a mans performance on the field
6332624 people want to remember where they were when they saw him do these things it was a transcendent moment for them
6332625 when you lose big games like that youre angry at yourself because when you wear the u s jersey a lot is expected youre supposed to win gold medals to miss out on even an opportunity to do that was very disappointing
6332626 its what fuels us i know not all of this team was there but everybody else watched it on tv weve already watched film on that game and i think were a much better team now sometimes losses turn out to be the biggest wins because you can learn more and they can motivate you
6332627 you can see that people are all about winning its never been about the stat sheet or whos got what
6332628 and i told them in our very first meeting that after winning three gold medals i cant remember who led what in any statistics
6332629 i can only take so much i needed to recharge my batteries
6332630 i thought he was the right man for the job at the right time
6332631 im doing it because i love baseball and i love working with very talented young players and putting them together in a winning cause
6332632 three things in human life are important the first is to be kind the second is to be kind and the third is to be kind
6332633 to pay lay people albeit briefly trained as stop smoking counsellors for spending a few sessions with smokers is an astonishing way to spend public money
6332634 this was all driven by the need to meet targets and it is a feature of the target driven culture of the governments of this country that it can lead to the distortion of proper functions and can lead as in this case to the opportunity for fraud
6332635 i have been a successful businessman in my life i have had the porsche the gold rolex watch and a home in chelsea now all i want to do is help the community
6332636 i know the jury and i and anyone else listening to this case would have been appalled at the cavalier way in which the taxpayers money was dealt with by the kensington and chelsea primary care trust
6332637 the fraud was allowed to continue with the result a large sum of public money designated for health care was lost
6332638 theres a disconnect between the antiquated laws and carpooling companies who are trying to help environmental goals
6332639 were a heavily regulated industry theres a tremendous amount of cost involved to operate a public vehicle operation
6332640 weve encouraged drivers to do it for free but people want to get money back for gas
6332641 for me it gets the creative juices going the mega stage is my notre dame my cathedral i plan to worship there regularly
6332642 we know were going to go through a tough time for a while
6332643 even when times are tough the film industry does tend to get through hard times were very confident well get our share
6332644 five years ago where we stand today was essentially a wasteland
6332645 five years from today filmport will be the epicentre of the creative economy of toronto and will have put us very clearly in our rightful place on the world stage
6332646 theyre not violent assaults theres no physical contact or grabbing per se
6332647 its contacts of fluids on clothing hes using the chaos of rush hour as cover the victims end up feeling dirty from the whole situation
6332648 we believe that a major factor in the funds historical valuation premium was its high distribution yield and that the recent erosion of that premium was due to the uncertainty over its distribution policy
6332649 as a low dividend paying growth corporation we expect it will be more difficult to attract the same premium as many investors do not value future growth potential as highly as current income
6332650 conversion may expand the funds investor base and could provide increased access to the debt and equity markets through a listing on the new york stock exchange but both could have been accomplished without cutting the distribution dividend rate our concern is that the distribution cut will increase the trusts cost of capital and make it more difficult to complete accretive acquisitions

6332655 amir will be ready for a world title in three or fights
6332656 at that point he will beat one of the world champions but i still wouldnt put him in with the likes of manny pacquiao wbc champion
6332657 but in a year to 18 months time he will be ready for anybody
6332658 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts
6332659 the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6332660 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media
6332661 above all though i am so sad that this together with the other allegations made have been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives
6332662 i knew we werent going to bottle it and we didnt its been a killer four years and it feels great to put it behind us
6332663 its unbelievable and its so special to do it with this fella simpson
6332664 i knew we werent going to bottle it and we didnt
6332665 its an easy thing to say but youve then got to go and do it
6332666 its no good saying youre frightened of losing because you wont enjoy playing
6332667 this is what weve got to do weve got to give them that confidence and say get the ball dont be frightened of making a mistake our players have to want the ball and keep it because if you dont get it you will run twice as far as the team who are holding the ball
6332668 theyre so confident in their own team and they feel good in their own system
6332669 is the champions league and the premier league more important to them than internationals and thats not a criticism that is saying its massive so therefore you go to play for england because you to want to play for england because were patriotic
6332670 weve got to try and make it easier but i dont know how they do that im talking about a fixture list for a start weve just had the first game of the season and now we are into the time where i would think every manager is saying not the first week of the season surely not
6332671 i was thinking that guys fast i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6332672 i had received information about a specific drug supplier wada received this persons name address and phone number who was allegedly working with elite track athletes
6332673 he takes one stride and i have to take 21 2 to keep up
6332674 its ridiculous when michael johnson did it it didnt look that easy how fast can a human being go
6332675 it is poetry in motion hes a gazelle and he has to get to 26 27 before he hits his proverbial prime

6332711 i became interested in the ways people cheat when our hospital started drug testing
6332712 i went home and called some 800 numbers i found online and found i could buy anything i wanted to falsify a test as long as i gave them my credit card number
6332713 some people think if you spend all this money and some of these products cost a lot they will work
6332714 employees know they will be tested employers tell them their places are drug free
6332715 medical defense and airline industries have been testing aggressively for years
6332716 but now its common in other industries too including construction utilities and education thanks to increased awareness of substance abuse employers not only screen employees but also do random testing after people are hired
6332717 the craziest one ive seen so far is a guy who used a catheter to put urine from a drug free friend into his own bladder before taking a urine test

6332729 she really pioneered the teaching of cpr to our residents with very little support
6332730 we kept track of the impact of her training along with actual cardiac arrests in the hospital and over time she demonstrated that survival rates were getting better
6332731 it takes a lot of individuals and resources to bring simulation in the training of doctors
6332732 if we put our heads together we can develop new modules and then evaluate their effectiveness in learning
6332733 it became very frustrating because this was happening too frequently
6332734 i started to interview people and collect data on resuscitation and i saw that we were asking too much from the first responders
6332735 instead of administering basic cpr they would prepare the room for advanced life support like getting the epinephrine and the defibrillator ready
6332736 this critical gap for all simulation research is the challenge to relate what happens in simulations to what happens in real situations
6332737 if providers learn and do well with simulated patients does that really mean better outcomes for actual patients
6332738 once students make mistakes they have less of a chance making them the second time around which may include real patients
6332739 by that point even cheering on my friends was painful
6332740 dara torres making the u s womens swim team at age 41 proved to all of us what determination is
6332741 age is still an obstacle but she has opened up a whole new world for older athletes
6332742 i knew i didnt want to end up like my parents had so i thought i can swim i can run i can ride a bike
6332743 im what i like to call a back of the pack er
6332744 winning is not what this is about for me its about being healthy of body heart and mind
6332745 melissa is coming back from the ultimate insult to her body and nearly starting from square one
6332746 the key is commitment swim bike run and youre done she has that part down
6332747 she has been a very active and very positive member
6332748 its something you can control when you have no control over other events in your life
6332749 its a joyful activity it makes me grin and it makes me feel very alive
6332750 how can any woman train for a triathlon during menopause
6332751 there will be lots of tears shed at the finish line because the i never thought i could do this emotion comes out then
6332752 this event takes you out of your comfort zone and transforms you in just one day its a coming out party where women prove to themselves and each other just what they can do
6332753 he is seeking to enforce a discretionary duty that is vested in county policymakers
6332754 it is my firm belief that the failure of the howard county department of inspections to enforce the code is detrimental to the health and welfare of the citizens of this county
6332755 all it does is require the county executive to do his duty
6332756 she had every reason to not do something but she always found ways to overcome her discomfort
6332757 we had talked about what would happen if the chemo didnt work and the possibility of her dying
6332758 this drug trial seemed very promising not as a cure but as a way to get anna more time
6332759 now she has touched the lives of the workers painting that casket you just know they have a great story to tell
6332760 when you think of anna you think of the most amazing person ever
6332761 even when she was having a crummy day she put it all aside and was happy to be with her friends
6332762 we were never shocked by her strength and goodness but we never took it for granted either
6332763 her life was like a stone being dropped in a pond and the ripples she created continue to affect more and more people even now that shes gone
6332764 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
6332765 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
6332766 after looking at all the treatment plans the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6332767 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing
6332768 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
6332769 she is dealing with a lot right now but it is a discussion that needs to take place
6332770 the difference here is that she has cancer she is not simply at risk for cancer
6332771 she needs to deal with what she is dealing with right now which is the breast cancer
6332772 your site is amazing i love photography too hopefully i can learn a thing or two from you

6332778 amir will be ready for a world title in three or fights
6332779 at that point he will beat one of the world champions but i still wouldnt put him in with the likes of manny pacquiao wbc champion
6332780 but in a year to 18 months time he will be ready for anybody
6332781 marche de mieux en mieux mais nous sommes limit s dans nos projets par le b timent qui nous abrite
6332782 this is a great opportunity to publicise the great shops hale has and the fresh local produce available
6332783 i knew we werent going to bottle it and we didnt its been a killer four years and it feels great to put it behind us
6332784 its unbelievable and its so special to do it with this fella simpson
6332785 i knew we werent going to bottle it and we didnt
6332786 my focus over the next 48 hours is to prepare my three boxers for their semi final bouts
6332787 the allegations made in the media about the conduct of athletes on the british boxing programme are on the whole unfounded
6332788 i feel extremely disillusioned that i have learnt of the suspension of one of my boxers from the media
6332789 above all though i am so sad that this together with the other allegations made have been raised to distract and unsettle me the coaching team and more importantly my boxers ahead of the most important bouts of their lives
6332790 we need not be afraid to touch to feel to show emotion the easiest thing in the world is to be what you are what you feel the hardest thing to be is what other people want you to be
6332791 its an easy thing to say but youve then got to go and do it
6332792 its no good saying youre frightened of losing because you wont enjoy playing
6332793 this is what weve got to do weve got to give them that confidence and say get the ball dont be frightened of making a mistake our players have to want the ball and keep it because if you dont get it you will run twice as far as the team who are holding the ball
6332794 theyre so confident in their own team and they feel good in their own system
6332795 is the champions league and the premier league more important to them than internationals and thats not a criticism that is saying its massive so therefore you go to play for england because you to want to play for england because were patriotic
6332796 weve got to try and make it easier but i dont know how they do that im talking about a fixture list for a start weve just had the first game of the season and now we are into the time where i would think every manager is saying not the first week of the season surely not
6332797 duncan was horrified his character has casual sex ends up getting crabs and is seen scratching himself in the corner shop
6332798 how can this possibly be suitable for a 7pm audience
6332799 duncan is a top actor and it is terrible that he has had to go through this crackpot charade
6332800 some people are so unhappy they are seriously thinking of throwing in the towel
6332801 it is not the happy place it used to be they have got rid of good people
6332802 doesnt seem to know what she wants at first it was a return to family values whatever they are
6332803 i wouldnt like to try to explain to children why douglas is fiddling about with his nether regions
6332804 motor automobila bio je jako glasan tko zna koliko je brzo vozio njih dvojica i li su do mjesne crkve gdje se mladi godinama okupljaju u ve ernjim satima pretjecao je kolonu i jednostavno ih pokupio
6332805 if you guess wrong and go to the wrong place first you waste more time and it costs you extra in co pays and fees
6332806 independently we all were getting a little uncomfortable with the level of service that was being provided to the patients in the emergency room
6332807 if you try to get all the lines in there you would lose the deer
6332808 i had to work that out so you could see the deer if things arent clear enough for people to figure out on a glance you lose them
6332809 its always twitter this twitter that and once you start you just cant stop
6332810 originally a lot of people hear about twitter and just dont get it but if you try it and work on it for a little bit you get it and it becomes addictive
6332811 when the quake hit at 11 42 a m the associate press first update came nine minutes later
6332812 the first twitter update came at 11 42 the same time the earthquake hit
6332813 people were able to keep connected with other users and see who was affected by the quake faster than with traditional media
6332814 the social media part of it is good because we can meet and talk to so many other people that we couldnt even think about encountering before
6332815 there are dangers to that but generally you find really nice people and have good relationships with them
6332816 i also use it as a way to gain information and get things done i can ask twitter some crazy ridiculous question and get three different answers from five different people in minutes
6332817 if its something stupid like going shopping im not going to post that but if its something interesting id post that
6332818 weve seen plenty of businesses use twitter to see what users are saying about their company
6332819 its a new and different way of finding information from customers
6332820 that is until the next big technological phenomenon is released
6332821 i like to be part of technology because there is no stopping it
6332822 and for families trying to cut back on spending some of the services theyre cutting we actually offer for free
6332823 we have seen more movie rentals this year and were continuing to keep up with patron requests to keep those numbers up
6332824 why would someone rent a movie elsewhere when we offer free dvd loans for a seven day period
6332825 were in here very often looking for books music movies and using the computers
6332826 theyve got a lot of good childrens programs that the kids like
6332827 theres always fluctuation but for the most part our program attendance is increasing
6332828 we find more and more babysitters and nannies are bringing children they watch to the events here
6332829 at some point in the summer this table is full of vacation requests
6332830 weve continued adding programs and software to keep up with demand
6332831 as demand for computers increased so did the demand for programs on them
6332832 for people without computers or who may not have money to buy expensive programs like microsoft office they can come to the library and work here
6332833 a lot of our patrons will come in with their laptops and log on that way
6332834 its just one more of the free services we offer
6332835 anyone using one of our computers can use it for as long as they need to provided they leave before the library closes
6332836 if its sunday afternoon during the school year when a computer is hard to come by well ask around to see if anyone isnt doing something important on a computer if youre playing a game we need that computer
6332837 not every family uses the internet enough to justify paying 50 a month for it so if youre a casual user or just checking your e mail save that money and use our services at no cost
6332838 we have a lot of older people who come in and tell us that their children keep telling them to go online to get information
6332839 so were teaching them to use the internet theyre looking for an e mail account to pull pictures of their grandchildren
6332840 were always surprised at the number of people that dont know were here and were free
6332841 the library card provides you access to a wealth of information and its free
6332842 books are still our no 1 most sought after item in the library
6332843 its your job as public officials to defend our laws
6332844 do not abandon the appeal until beaver hall tells you what they are going to build
6332845 this does not have to do with any other property in sewickley
6332846 its what was there before and we feel that we are entitled to the same non conformities
6332847 para starcraft ii quer amos maximizar la compatibilidad con sistemas menos potentes para asegurarnos de no perjudicar la jugabilidad y ofrecerlo a la mayor base de jugadores posibles pero al mismo tiempo quer amos utilizar el potencial m ximo del hardware disponible para asegurarnos de que el juego tenga un aspecto competitivo esto significa que soportar un amplio rango de hardware desde ati radeon 9800 o nvidia geforce fx hasta ati radeon hd 4800 y nvidia geforce g200

6332852 the church has been so good to them all these years
6332853 im country where i grew up i was told to be polite to everybody
6332854 it is one of the flaws of no child left behind the expectation that a child who has severe learning problems should make the same kind of growth and overall achievement as someone who does not have those difficulties
6332855 nonetheless were concerned about that we want our special education students to achieve at high levels
6332856 we made some significant improvements at all grade levels this year
6332857 we have made a concerted effort here to have more of an intentional intense focus on curriculum and instruction
6332858 sometimes schools maintain a focus thats too broad and try to have concurrent multiple initiatives
6332859 weve decided that we needed to focus on good old fashioned teaching and learning
6332860 kindermusik is a internationally known award winning program for early childhood development
6332861 it stimulates learning skills theres nothing like it in the area we saw a gap and wanted to fill it
6332862 parents learn more about their childs unique development process and the shared learning experience creates a unique bond as the child associates learning with fun musical play
6332863 because activities in class are so child focused parents can easily extend these activities at home and continue the classroom experience
6332864 she has a very good track record for teaching children
6332865 if someone is thinking about adopting we would love for that to happen
6332866 it means a lot to be able to allow the humane society to come in and hopefully find homes for the animals in their shelter
6332867 so we always get someone who is looking to add a pet to their family and weve had many success stories
6332868 its an entire veterinarian visit for a very reasonable price
6332869 they told me that dogs without collars dont get a walk
6332870 i felt so terrible for those dogs to be in a shelter without a home and not even get a walk is very sad
6332871 they work very hard trying to give animals good homes and dont always receive a lot of attention for it
6332872 were trying to do our part in helping all animals get a good and loving home
6332873 its so rural its just lovely if we ever moved we would never find this again
6332874 we are only 15 minutes away from sewickley its easy its so close to the city too but when you come home you have that absolute peace
6332875 some of the older people in the borough remember being disgusted when that development went though
6332876 whenever one of us goes out we call the other ones to see if they need anything
6332877 so many kids in sewickley hills now theyve all grown up
6332878 i thought where else would you find a police chief who would do that and if youre out walking and the police ride by they will stop and talk to you i love it
6332879 as you go into the older section thats where the farms begin acres of acres have retained that rural character but ive noticed more people selling off pieces of land for homes
6332880 its funny about sewickley hills you can live next to a high powered lawyer or executive and on the other side of you there still is farm land where people grow food for their family we really run a gamet
6332881 i hate to see the woods disappearing you always see people tearing down the woods to put in parking lots but no one ever tears down the parking lots to put in woods
6332882 i would like to see some of it stay country
6332883 we had to open all the windows to let the breeze come in
6332884 but you cant fight progress you have to accept it
6332885 when the little kids grow up we want them to be able to say we had this and we had that but we still had that rural place and didnt live in the city in cut out box homes we still maintained the country
6332886 sewickley hills is the last place i can think of where you are 20 minutes from an international airport but you can ride a horse on your property
6332887 i actually live where people go to escape and be on vacation
6332888 durante a opera o morreram mais de 30 rebeldes e foi destru do um importante paiol com morteiros e explosivos
6332889 bike elockers can accommodate many more customers than the old style keyed lockers that were rented by customers on an annual basis
6332890 those keyed lockers were restrictive because when they were not in use by the renter they were empty and not accessible to others
6332891 the racks were almost always full youd think that bart would have more places to lock up a persons bicycle
6332892 wholesale fuel prices are 100 higher than they were a year ago despite any recent easing in world oil prices and are forecast to continue to rise so a significant electricity price increase is inevitable
6332893 nie energy looks to buy electricity a year in advance to give price stability and insulate customers as much as possible from increases in wholesale fuel costs
6332894 we cant control world fuel prices but what we can do is encourage more of our customers to take advantage of one of our discount schemes such as keypad or direct debit to help offset increasing energy costs
6332895 we can confirm we have now entered a period of formal consultation with the utility regulator the consumer council for northern ireland and the department for enterprise trade and investment deti in relation to the regulated tariffs for phoenix supplys domestic and small industrial and commercial customers
6332896 while wholesale gas costs have continued to rise to levels beyond those at the time of our previous tariff review the outcome of the consultation process is not something we can speculate on
6332897 my wife is leaving me and i must sell my collection to pay my bills

6332901 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust
6332902 and when he the holy spirit is come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of judgment
6332903 and this is life eternal that they might know thee the only true god and jesus christ whom you have sent
6332904 you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain
6332905 because you are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world will hate you
6332906 as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby
6332907 looking unto jesus the author and finisher of your faith
6332908 my brethren count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience
6332909 and he healed all that were sick that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by isaiah the prophet saying himself took our infirmities and bare our sicknesses
6332910 that no man should be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed thereunto
6332911 if god be for me who can be against me
6332912 blessed be god even the father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and the god of all comfort who comforts us in all our tribulation that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble by the comfort wherewith we ourselves are comforted of god
6332913 and the lord shall deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom
6332914 a glorious high throne from the beginning of time for us humans is the place of our sanctuary
6332915 walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god
6332916 i press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of god in christ jesus

6332920 blogs make you go out there meet people get to know them and fall in love
6332921 its an easy thing to say but youve then got to go and do it
6332922 its no good saying youre frightened of losing because you wont enjoy playing

6332931 amir will be ready for a world title in three or fights
6332932 at that point he will beat one of the world champions but i still wouldnt put him in with the likes of manny pacquiao wbc champion
6332933 but in a year to 18 months time he will be ready for anybody

6332940 were going to try to keep good communication with him during the game and give him an opportunity to play
6332941 i think its a good thing thats a positive thing
6332942 you want continuity there granted theyve played together a long time but they need to get in there and do it now and thats what they are going to do
6332943 were going to give tony an opportunity there and see how he does if we like what we see then well give him a little bit more if we dont then well move on to something else
6332944 we have enough of a gauge where we feel he can start the game there and well see how he does
6332945 we feel comfortable enough with that and well give him an opportunity to get in there and bang it a little bit and see what he can do
6332946 im hearing every day about homes going into foreclosure sometimes i hear it every hour its affecting people from all walks of life
6332947 a lot of them just dont know what they are going to do
6332948 it comes with the announcement of layoffs at one company and people begin to fear whether that will happen to them
6332949 that fear is heightened if you already have a family member or child who is ill
6332950 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6332951 people need a say in how their land is used
6332952 i dont like bailouts but i dont want to see the state going into a deep depression either
6332953 the government shouldnt be involved in bailouts but we need to research it so it doesnt catastrophically hurt people we dont need to put additional burdens on people
6332954 i havent seen anyone come forward with the number and potential
6332955 i also want to see a plan for protecting the environment
6332956 it needs to be done in an environmentally responsible manner he said adding that the drilling rigs will be
6332957 regulation is not the answer a lot of green solutions are out there
6332958 access to healthcare is a major issue in north carolina we have to get our arms around this as a society for the good of the people

6332962 if you listen to the people who call me you may change your mind that its an appropriate role for the government to assist with affordable housing the government does have a role to play

6332970 as we look back on it we see that there were just some serious failures in the management of risks
6332971 according to medical staff at vafc david sommeil has been the victim of a heart problem bringing about a loss of consciousness
6332972 there is it seems to me a cardinal error in the modern insistence on the biographical and historical that is to say the external factuality of the avatar the incidents of his outward life what matters is the spiritual reality the power the influence that come with him or that he brought down by his action and his existence first of all what matters in a spiritual mans life is not what he did or what he was outside to the view of the men of his time that is what historicity or biography comes to does it not but what he was and did within it is only that that gives any value to his outer life at all it is the inner life that gives to the outer any power it may have and the inner life of a spiritual man is something vast and full and at least in the great figures so crowded and teeming with significant things that no biographer or historian could ever hope to seize it all or tell it whatever is significant in the outward life is so because it is symbolical of what has been realised within himself and one may go on and say that the inner life also is only significant as an expression a living representation of the movement of the divinity behind it
6332973 first of all what matters in a spiritual mans life
6332974 if we go by him would amount to her telling us lies
6332975 yogananda clearly stated it himself and his yogananda statement would be a lie if he wasnt god manifest upon earth
6332976 to understand the significance of circumstances actions and events in the life of such a person must therefore necessarily require us to rise to the same consciousness or atleast grow towards it
6332977 fuel prices have a direct effect on the type of vehicle people choose to buy and when they choose to buy
6332978 with sports utility vehicles theres probably a delayed reaction compared to passenger cars
6332979 certainly the slump in car sales in july wasnt just the result of a slowing economy as the increase in the luxury car tax caused buyers to bring forward purchases into june
6332980 but no doubt the gloomy mood of consumers also had a lot to do with the fact that car sales slumped in the latest month
6332981 mind you plants cant run away from bugs and other pests they need to deal with them one of the things they do is to release volatile substances into the air so as to attract predators of the bugs
6332982 genetic engineering modification gm of green leaf volatile production holds significant potential towards formulating environmentally friendly pest control strategies it also has important implications for manipulating food flavour
6332983 for example the aroma of virgin olive oil stems from the volatiles synthesized by olives by modifying the activity of enzymes that generate these substances it may be possible to alter the flavour of the resulting oils
6332984 our work shows how you can convert one enzyme to another and more importantly provides the needed information for modifying the glv production in plants

6332988 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6332989 it really is a case of hidden nature revealing itself to the world after remaining in splendid isolation for so long and demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6332990 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken one hundred years to get from the balustrade to the house so were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden
6332991 if the iron reacts with water then it will be locked away with other minerals and wont reach the core as metallic iron
6332992 if we look at the star we will know the iron silicate ratio and some of the chemistry that was present while these planets were forming
6332993 people dont consume as much calcium as nutritionists would like and one reason for this is that foods high in calcium dont taste good to many people
6332994 by understanding how calcium is detected in the mouth we can either make it easier to consume by reducing its bad taste or even make pharmacological agents that make it taste better
6332995 most mice dislike calcium but we found a very unusual strain that drinks it avidly by comparing the genes of this strain with other strains we were able to identify the two calcium taste genes
6332996 it remains to be seen if what we have discovered in mice the existence of two calcium taste genes holds true for humans we know people have the sweet taste gene tas1r3 and the gene involved with the calcium sensing receptor casr we dont know if we have the same forms of genes as the mice have but it seems pretty likely they have the same function
6332997 our results appear to demonstrate that vigabatrin induced satiety in these animals
6332998 given the growing obesity epidemic we felt that examining vigabatrins therapeutic efficacy for obesity was particularly relevant
6332999 the fact that these results occurred in genetically obese animals offers hope that this drug could potentially treat severe obesity
6333000 sonics revenue for 2009 is expected to be greater than 15 per cent above the 2008 figure
6333001 earnings per share growth is expected to be greater than 10 per cent depending on foreign exchange and interest rate movements and excluding any acquisitions other than those already announced
6333002 we will continue to pursue a growth path via both organic and acquisitional growth
6333003 were flagging that the year 2009 has started well and july and the best part of august have been very strong and thats across hospitals and pathology
6333004 notwithstanding the challenges of a tougher economic environment change in coles will gain momentum as work continues to fix the basics
6333005 the changes wont suddenly be obvious on a particular day or date but the results of progress made to date and the strategies being planned will deliver value to our shareholders and our customers
6333006 more customers into our stores and having them buy more product
6333007 the results are pleasing given a tightening economy and the varanus gas outage which curtailed our western australian energy and chemicals operations in june
6333008 fuel prices have a direct effect on the type of vehicle people choose to buy and when they choose to buy she said
6333009 with sports utility vehicles theres probably a delayed reaction compared to passenger cars
6333010 certainly the slump in car sales in july wasnt just the result of a slowing economy as the increase in the luxury car tax caused buyers to bring forward purchases into june he said
6333011 but no doubt the gloomy mood of consumers also had a lot to do with the fact that car sales slumped in the latest month

6333024 i prefer the east coast where its 100 degrees and humid right now and in the winter i love the snow and the blizzards and all that im crazy to be here i dont really understand why ive come here
6333025 hes been through the ups and the downs i wouldnt call it mellowing i think its just sort of evening out a little bit i think hes a little more patient with things
6333026 i realized that if i was going to take on this challenge id need to have a second in command who when i get assassinated could take over right away
6333027 im very confident in dave hes not only a friend but hes an absolutely loyal person with a lot of integrity which is rare in this business
6333028 in having two duties as head coach and general manager thats a lot of responsibility and i know a lot of my successes in coaching have been because ive had very good players but also because ive had a guy next to me i could depend on
6333029 if this game is taken away from me tomorrow i could just say boy ive had experiences that no one else has ever had
6333030 ive experienced the highs and lows in this game ive sat with presidents in the white house i met prime ministers and leaders all over the world ive coached in world cups i feel like this game has been more than fair to me

6333047 uk water footprint the impact of the uks food and fibre consumption on global water resources
6333048 only 38 per cent of the uks total water use comes from its own rivers lakes and groundwater reserves
6333049 the rest is taken from water bodies in many countries across the world to irrigate and process food and fibre crops that people in britain subsequently consume
6333050 whats particularly worrying is that huge amounts of these products are grown in drier areas of the world where water resources are either already stressed or very likely to become so in the near future
6333051 most people arent even aware that it takes massive amounts of water to grow the food and fibres we consume on top of what is used for drinking and washing and watering the lawn
6333052 therefore it is essential that business and government identify the areas that could potentially suffer water crises and develop solutions so the environment is not overexploited to the point that people and wildlife lose out
6333053 the significance of our study is that it identifies smurf1 as the signalling partner through which tnf does damage in ra related bone loss
6333054 that has enabled researchers to begin designing small molecule drugs to shut down the action of smurf 1 and its relatives

6333070 in every generation there is a chosen one one girl in all the world one born with the strength and skill to hunt the vampires
6333071 for this small colony of snails to remain undiscovered for more than 100 years despite thousands of people visiting cliveden every year is remarkable
6333072 it really is a case of hidden nature revealing itself to the world after remaining in splendid isolation for so long and demonstrates how important our built structures can be for wildlife discoveries like this are rare and its a chance for us to celebrate the amazing nature of wildlife
6333073 although the cliveden snail hitched a ride to the uk accidentally it doesnt appear to be a threat to our native wildlife as it has taken one hundred years to get from the balustrade to the house so were now working to ensure that it has a secure future at cliveden
6333074 its amazing that something which was thought to exist theoretically in mathematical physics could actually be found in an alloy which was simply formed by melting together a few common elements
6333075 it might be possible to see similar effects in devices made using materials and methods found in laser pointers this would put what weve seen firmly in the realm of that which can easily be achieved using current technologies
6333076 we are looking forward to investigating whether we can see these effects using thin layers of the same materials deposited directly on the silicon wafers these wafers are the same as those used by mass market electronics manufacturers as the basis for integrated circuits
6333077 with the end of moores law in sight mechanisms for controlling and understanding possible new information bits such as spins in solids are actively being sought after
6333078 the stresses in question are those that would be experienced in a natural disaster such as an earthquake or hurricane a terrorist attack or a sudden bereavement
6333079 its a very striking confirmation of something that has been suspected for quite some time the placenta is very sensitive to stress hormones in the mother these hormones were probably amplified during the time of the war
6333080 a developing foetus requires some exposure to maternal stress hormones as it normalizes their stress functioning but women experiencing anxiety or excessive stress would do well to address it before a planned pregnancy and to have good social support systems

6333083 the national security agency has said that based on our present technology we have about a 20 year window of security that means if we sent up a satellite today it would take somebody about 20 years to crack the code quantum computers will let you develop a code that would be impossible to crack with a conventional computer

6333104 no one knows who i am i live here on less than a dollar a month
6333105 i live like a recluse no one knows i exist
6333106 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related
6333107 it was very brief we spoke for just a few minutes
6333108 the government does need to focus on what it is going to do to stop these militants and weve had that conversation very recently when the pakistani prime minister was in washington to meet with president bush
6333109 we all have an interest in fighting terrorism and the militants because the militants are not just after the united states or afghanistan these are the people who after all assassinated benazir bhutto these are the people who have launched attacks throughout pakistan
6333110 we didnt always agree with mr musharraf for instance we didnt agree with the state of emergency several months ago but president musharraf served well as an ally in the war on terror
6333111 we want to help them in terms of social development educational reform all of the things that they want to do
6333112 i dont know but i think they must be leaning toward it
6333113 i would hope theres a reason i didnt go and that its because they want me to be here
6333114 alans been very consistent and his ability to pitch nearly every day has been invaluable in times when our bullpen has been overworked as a group but we wont make those types of contractual decisions until after the season
6333115 granted theyve changed gears in the direction theyre going but i think i can still help them on the field and off the field i havent had the greatest season but im healthy and my arm is still good and over the course of my career if ive had a bad year dont bet against me the next season
6333116 that was a good spot for me to come into and have success
6333117 the biggest thing was location i threw almost every pitch right where i wanted to it was a real good feeling
6333118 i think the stuff we do in between starts has allowed him to get to this point and his arm is feeling good
6333119 its really hard to put into words because weve been down and when were down it seems like were down
6333120 its not for lack of effort what we have right now is a learning process
6333121 sometimes we dont have what it takes to get back into games were not having success late in games not getting big hits
6333122 if i wasnt wearing long sleeves i felt like my arm would have been at the backstop
6333123 and try to put some life back into my arm
6333124 i was definitely harder on myself in early august wanting to get back out there
6333125 i think that the relationship between people that are great is they have a common thread of knowing how to beat their competitors and they know how to constantly be in shape and in top form
6333126 if thats the case id know everything about how to beat michael
6333127 hed also know everything to beat me wed have to tie
6333128 at this stage were waiting for formal identification procedures to take place before we take the matter any further
6333129 it may have been snagged it may have been under water for a period of time and with the recent rain has just been brought to the surface its probable hes washed down from further up
6333130 theyll get mad at you if you dont push the envelope
6333131 there was a delay because i didnt know where the ball was
6333132 usually when theres a lack of hustle its not in the ninth inning down by one whoever is saying that doesnt know about baseball that doesnt bother me one bit
6333133 it looked like he was out of whack from the beginning a lot of times when you get jammed youre not sure where you hit it i remember paul oneill used to hit balls and hed have no idea where he hit them wed be screaming for him to run
6333134 i made a really wide turn around first thats what im guilty of
6333135 my only regret is that i wish i would have picked up the ball right away and had a better turn that guy just made an unbelievable play
6333136 if you look at our numbers its no secret that we havent really done what we need to do with men on base
6333137 if we have a two run deficit i dont try for second if were not in a tie game in anaheim i dont try to steal third there are a lot of factors most notably the scoreboard which dictates how you play the game
6333138 you take more calculated risks rather than being passive because ive always found that in baseball fortune always favors the bold if you sit back and wait for the game to come to you it wont
6333139 one month back rate was around rupees 13 800 and it has come down now our season has also started those who are committed to purchase especially for marriage they have started to purchase gold not ornaments right now some people who have not purchased in last six months seeing the rates have come down they have started purchasing ornaments also
6333140 new trends are coming out as well as prices are getting lower so i think people are coming out and buying new fashion ornaments
6333141 trucks have drinking water food material and tents infact we have tried to include everything that was asked for by the victims
6333142 i was a big fan he was with the packers they had just won a few nfc championships and he was in his mvp seasons he was at the top of his game i was fired up to see him
6333143 i cant remember if i helped him get in or what
6333144 it lets us go about our business and focus on football that is all we want to do
6333145 they got a good quarterback and some excitement over there with him and kind of get out of the shadows so to speak
6333146 i give them a tremendous amount of credit and respect
6333147 but that is over and done with and obviously it is a new year a lot of things have changed
6333148 when you are struggling in the bullpen which we have done periodically
6333149 i feel confident we have the guys here to get the job done
6333150 over the times ive been here whether it was this time or before as an assistant coach it was always great to have the energy from the fans
6333151 it gets a little bit long during training camp at times and there are some days when the coffee is just not getting it done having the fans there and having kids here having their passion here its always been great
6333152 just being able to spend time with them is pretty unique
6333153 considering the fact i was going on three hours sleep i felt pretty good
6333154 in that particular situation it gives us a chance to freshen up tatis that would be a big plus for us in that sense when he does come back we dont have to rely on him playing every single day
6333155 depends on how he feels its almost like hes coming out of spring training
6333156 i feel its better i played a good game im waiting for tony bernazard or omar to call me
6333157 it was just a bad all around game ive had two or three games this year where ive just been awful
6333158 he never did give up a ball hit hard until he gave up the home run but we threw the ball away in the first inning just created something sloppy and they ended up with five runs it wouldve been very easy to have a zero put up in that inning

6333166 he had a major league deal somewhere else but he chose to take a minor league deal with us
6333167 i feel comfortable the guys we have here will get the job done
6333168 we dont have to rely on him playing every single day
6333169 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the uk where we can do that
6333170 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children
6333171 mike is evolving into one of the bright young pitching stars in the national league no question about it
6333172 from where he came from early in the season we were questioning whether or not to have him on the staff questioning whether or not to keep him in the rotation and hes pretty much been a huge part of the success weve had here and thats a tribute to him
6333173 there was never any issue with his mechanics or anything of that type he just needed to cross that line and have some success
6333174 mike has evolved into one of the bright young pitching stars in the national league
6333175 theres no question about it and i think hell continue to mature and develop with each outing hes been very impressive from where he came early in the season where we were questioning whether or not to have him on the staff whether or not to keep him in the rotation and hes pretty much been a huge part of the success that weve had here
6333176 but the years not over im just going to continue to work and see what happens
6333177 our inside guys are good and our outside guys are good weve got a good mixture of youth and experience
6333178 the coaches and players are starting to understand what we have personnel wise weve got a great secondary great coverage justin will be a good addition on the d line and ray mcdonald is showing hes a solid player its going to culminate in a lot of sacks
6333179 if i could go back and do it over id wait till it was 100 percent
6333180 i wasnt able to make the plays i wanted to make i dont want to write it off that i was injured but my expectations were a lot higher for last year
6333181 lets not make too much about the green bay game its preseason it was a great evaluation and thats it nobodys arrived and we all know that
6333182 i was happy with the effort but there were a lot of mistakes made we need to get a lot further
6333183 it was a blessing to play on the same defensive front as him
6333184 hes playing with good leverage and hes got very good quickness
6333185 they are making it look a lot easier than it is
6333186 i was looking for something in the middle of the plate and jurrjens threw me a pretty good changeup and i took it he came back with a fastball and i was able to punch one up the middle
6333187 i respect him as a player i respect him as a person and hes got a family i know how this business works and he has to provide for his family and i would never do anything to take away from that ability i just couldnt live with myself thats just not the type of person i am
6333188 its our job to go out and prove people wrong
6333189 i believe in this team and i know everybody else does
6333190 for me personally experience is just the confidence to know that nothing is insurmountable people think youre out you almost want to prove them wrong more
6333191 we were able to get a lead in the first inning
6333192 when we need him to come up clutch he always does it
6333193 im quite curious to see how far he can go because he has the demeanor
6333194 there are different kinds of coaches there are coaches who are always on their players always whipping they tend to be short term guys then there is the type that are more laid back but know how to kick when they have to kick they tend to last a lot longer gordys got to find his own niche
6333195 im extremely excited about the chance to be able to coach anaheims top farm team and certainly here in iowa
6333196 i know coming in here there is a real excitement that anaheim has moved their affiliation here certainly based on the success that theyve had in the past with their minor league affiliates hopefully that bodes well for all of us as far as the development of anaheims prospects but also for putting a real competitive team on the ice here
6333197 i definitely have a familiarity with the players and more importantly with the anaheim way of doing things
6333198 theyve kind of developed a culture within their organization that they are going to play a real strong physical brand of hockey that is entertaining for fans and is a real in your face style of hockey
6333199 son now you wont have to compete against black kids
6333200 today the days of being cut off from the rest of the world while in the air become history
6333201 as ive said were looking at guys who are not having the best years
6333202 there was a major league offer but hes chosen to go with us
6333203 how he would be used if brought up would be up to manager jerry manuel
6333204 i wouldnt know him if he walked into the room
6333205 any time you get critical outs it sets the tone for the rest of the team
6333206 with an eye on the clock the white house continues to drag its feet and do everything possible to postpone public access to the records of this presidency
6333207 a backup system isnt designed to be a 100 percent complete inventory of all e mails
6333208 its designed to make a copy of data at a specific point in time
6333209 data is backed up on a daily weekly and monthly basis as part of a disaster recovery strategy to ensure to protect the organization from data loss
6333210 generally when the scope of the work is expected to fluctuate by a factor of nearly 10 i can only take you so seriously
6333211 contractors cannot accurately plan for or staff based on such an estimate
6333212 we will continue to work with members of congress and the national archives and will communicate the results of our accounting effort at an appropriate time
6333213 were just trying to get our team ready for the season thats what everybodys trying to do
6333214 well its different with different guys depending on their backgrounds
6333215 some guys take longer to learn your system i dont think theres any set way to go about it at all
6333216 if you want to do a jets story i cant help you with the jets go to the jets if you want to do a jets story
6333217 well prepare our team the way we have to do and get ready for kansas city in the opener
6333218 our focus isnt on what everyone else is doing its about what were doing well have to be good enough in a different area to meet the challenge both personnel wise and scheme wise
6333219 i have one race to go i have to refocus again to get one more gold medal
6333220 i dont want to say anything too serious because my coach might want me to run 400 meters
6333221 anything is possible if i put my mind to it im not worried about that now dont hold your breath i dont think ill be going up to the 400 anytime soon
6333222 the 200 has been my love since i was 15
6333223 i was the youngest ever to win world juniors it means a lot to me its dear to my heart the 200 means more to me than the 100
6333224 i wont compare myself to michael phelps to win eight gold medals thats great im on the track and hes in the water you cant compare the two
6333225 theres nothing on the roads before the race was run
6333226 he ran 52 flat for the 400 on a grass track
6333227 i got up at 12 my masseuse brought me nuggets of course im serious i didnt want to go to the cafeteria i went straight to the track and my masseuse brought me more nuggets
6333228 i thought he robbed us of another great performance in the 100 because i thought he could run 9 50
6333229 im so pleased i thought if he runs if he truly runs this is his olympic games its magical none of us thought world record i thought 19 55 19 52
6333230 i assume his first 100 had to be faster than michael
6333231 a 6 5 sprinter with cat like feet and the turnover to match the smaller guys if he has the same tempo and takes nine foot strides its ridiculous you just cant match it
6333232 hes bad he broke the 100 meter record the 200 meter record
6333233 im serious hes bad the guy came out and made this the best olympics of my lifetime
6333234 everybody knows about it no matter how good their practice is
6333235 it was classic cliche it was at berkeley bowl and we had just met with someone from greenpeace
6333236 i said to robyn have you thought about how nice it would be to have a space in beijing that was completely dedicated to yoga
6333237 its a place you can go where you can get away from the craziness of beijing
6333238 people come and go a lot in beijing but this communitys been quite steady
6333239 its a yoga thing you meet your edge and you pull back
6333240 it builds your personal flexibility with situations that are beyond your control
6333241 this is the one thing that both jets and giants fans would agree on the first time in history
6333242 im not going to flip my psl like a condo
6333243 this is not the way we expect loyal fans should be treated
6333244 hes been through everything and he can help me out when i get nervous and talk to him
6333245 has not been determined as of yet but it is known that they suffered from extensive water smoke and heat damage
6333246 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6333247 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that
6333248 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6333249 bolt won two races phelps won eight two eight hello
6333250 it was the most impressive athletic feat ive seen in my life
6333251 it is poetry in motion hes not like a beast running hes a gazelle
6333252 and im not going to fault bolt for his style hes fun and i dont think any of his competitors are resentful of it hes a jovial fun loving guy hes having a good time which our sport sorely needs and hes seizing the moment
6333253 this is what i do for a living so ive got to really focus on what i want
6333254 we cant arrange long term care here so we try to do the best we can in the country of origin
6333255 its important to make sure that hospitals arent permitted to dump patients on an international level when they cant do it on a local level
6333256 hospitals dont have the financial resources to meet all of the acute care needs of patients without insurance let alone take on all the chronic care needs that present with patients like this
6333257 the second year in a system is always a little bit easier
6333258 i am familiar with my teammates familiar with the offense i am familiar with the organization the guys they brought in are great guys we all get along well on and off the field its just an easier transition the second year
6333259 the reps he gets in practice and theres been a lot of reps some have him doing other things whether its on the passing game screens protections all those reps count too
6333260 hes not a guy that just carries the ball hes got to do all the other things as well
6333261 they work on things you really need to work on i get a lot work in practice
6333262 this is my ninth year in the league i know how to play the game
6333263 we just wanted to improve our game some and be able to come out and be more explosive and be all around defensive tackles
6333264 not just play on running downs first and second down but have more of an impact on pash rush and everything
6333265 thats a testament especially to a guy like fred a veteran whos already accomplished so much and made a lot of money and done everything you want to do in this league
6333266 for him to still have that kind of drive just shows you what kind of competitor he is
6333267 you do so much with the all star games and the combines and stuff you never really get your legs under you last year we changed the defense so i wasnt completely comfortable
6333268 but this year being able to control my offseason with all the work to be fresh and having such a great knowledge of coach steve spagnuolos defense i just feel like im in the best shape physically and mentally since i can remember
6333269 we just won a super bowl and we are not satisfied with our play
6333270 theres always room for improvement no matter how good you did in the game how good you did during the regular season theres always room to get better and improve and thats what we are working on man
6333271 some people maybe dont want to take a gamble on me with my past
6333272 thankfully brian cashman gave me a call im trying to help this team make the playoffs
6333273 im just happy that the yankees gave me a chance
6333274 but albany i guess thats a good place to vacation
6333275 hopefully we can get all the receivers back and get them healthy just so we can get into the flow of things
6333276 im sure coach coughlin wants me out there every day
6333277 im just happy its not the regular season thats all im saying
6333278 nothing takes the place of those reps in practice when the defense is out there 7 on 7
6333279 hopefully ill be good within a week getting used to everything
6333280 im sorry i didnt get a chance to write before im having a great time
6333281 we dont know why that will be part of the investigation
6333282 when you play so nicely like this i think you deserve a big hug special treat extra privilege
6333283 if you dont settle down ill have to ask you to leave the room and return when you can stay here quietly
6333284 the shepherd doesnt leave his flock when the wolf comes
6333285 the ways of hashem are always good you know yaely about this we do not question
6333286 you are part of a good strong chain you know
6333287 she has died the good woman mrs lia waldman daughter of the nagybaner rav may her soul be entwined in the bouquet of life
6333288 left and right all americans know that freedom is better that slavery that love is better than hate kindness better than cruelty tolerance better than bigotry we dont always know how we know these things and yet mysteriously we know them nonetheless
6333289 the true complexity arises when we must defend these values in a world that does not universally embrace them when we reach the place where we must be intolerant in order to defend tolerance or unkind in order to defend kindness or hateful in order to defend what we love
6333290 whoever is kind to the cruel will end up being cruel to the kind
6333291 members of the antiwar movement wound up being involved in the betrayal of far eastern nations in a genocide and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there do they understand their responsibility today or do they prefer not to hear
6333292 a country is not just what it does it is also what it tolerates
6333293 nu stiu sa scriu si ce as mai scrie mai bine mi aplec inima sa si lase amprenta aici pe h rtie
6333294 traiesc cu sentimentul ca pot triumfa in multe domenii si ca pot deveni un om marcant al istoriei ce o vor citi nepotii mei insa lenea ma impinge sa traiesc viata unui simplu muritor dar am de gand sa schimb asta
6333295 its the time where we need to get guys back
6333296 weve steadily lost lost lost guys and now its time for them to come back back back
6333297 it went well in spots we have a lot of things to clean up were still in training camp mode a little but there are some positive things to build on
6333298 it gave me a lot of energy to see them mens 200 run that fast i knew the track was going to be fast we had just come out to the track i looked at the board and saw the world record time i knew those guys were going to run fast
6333299 i took it in for a few minutes and then blocked it out
6333300 im glad to know hes from jamaica and that hes supernatural
6333301 well i was kind of expecting it ive dreamed about it a million times i wanted to be the victorious one in this race i can see myself crossing the finish line
6333302 tons and tons of bait oh we got the humpbacks feeding on anchovy we even got spots of krill and some baby squid it looks good down here
6333303 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6333304 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6333305 i am so happy i cannot express my feelings in words
6333306 while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6333307 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6333308 i was crying because i was remembering back when we were both on the afghan refugee tae kwon do team in iran
6333309 there are literally so many benefits that it sells itself
6333310 when you tell a commercial property owner or a homeowner that this mulch will last eight years you see a light bulb go on
6333311 i think i read somewhere that hes faster than me
6333312 probably right and im one of the fastest guys in the nba
6333313 yeah he said good game good luck in the future you have a bright future
6333314 comments from a guy like that its quite an honor
6333315 thats why im so lucky to be able to participate in this its the best basketball tournament in the world
6333316 ill take it back to college and try to teach those guys what ive learned and hopefully we can do something in the college level hopefully it does a lot for the st marys program
6333317 for the past two weeks we tried to ignore the pressure to defend our gold medal but the world has gotten so much better we played them on their home field advantage and we stepped up and we won and it was beautiful
6333318 weve played in the rain before and its just something that were able to do unless theres lightning
6333319 its fun and thats what makes our game so enjoyable you can play no matter what the conditions are i think its harder being a fan sitting in the rain than being a player
6333320 its just another reason why we play in bathing suits
6333321 i hope we keep going i feel like we have unfinished business
6333322 we knew all year it might come down to us and a chinese final and thats what you want to see
6333323 to come up against these young girls its amazing weve been playing against tian for a number of years and to see her on the other side of the net in the finals its been great
6333324 we just respect them and were humbled by this i cant even think about what london will be like
6333325 i think i read somewhere that hes faster than me
6333326 probably right and im one of the fastest guys in the nba
6333327 yeah he said good game good luck in the future you have a bright future
6333328 comments from a guy like that its quite an honor
6333329 thats why im so lucky to be able to participate in this its the best basketball tournament in the world
6333330 ill take it back to college and try to teach those guys what ive learned and hopefully we can do something in the college level hopefully it does a lot for the st marys program
6333331 i didnt want it to happen like the 1 500
6333332 i was why not go all the way i ran good today im very pleased my legs responded very well im very confident
6333333 after the trials i lost a few weeks of training im good now we have a real good medical staff with usa track amp field
6333334 hes obviously not happy with what happened it doesnt matter if i win six games or 20 games if we have success as a team thats the biggest thing thats whats important to us weve had a good run lately except for the stretch in houston and we bounced back from that so keep it going
6333335 i get to come back to work tomorrow and start over
6333336 tonights win is in large part because of the way matty went out and threw the ball and competed
6333337 its really hard to put into words because weve been down and when were down it seems like were down
6333338 its not for lack of effort what we have right now is a learning process
6333339 sometimes we dont have what it takes to get back into games were not having success late in games not getting big hits
6333340 if i wasnt wearing long sleeves i felt like my arm would have been at the backstop
6333341 and try to put some life back into my arm
6333342 i was definitely harder on myself in early august wanting to get back out there
6333343 i dont know but i think they must be leaning toward it
6333344 i would hope theres a reason i didnt go and that its because they want me to be here
6333345 alans been very consistent and his ability to pitch nearly every day has been invaluable in times when our bullpen has been overworked as a group but we wont make those types of contractual decisions until after the season
6333346 granted theyve changed gears in the direction theyre going but i think i can still help them on the field and off the field i havent had the greatest season but im healthy and my arm is still good and over the course of my career if ive had a bad year dont bet against me the next season
6333347 that was a good spot for me to come into and have success
6333348 the biggest thing was location i threw almost every pitch right where i wanted to it was a real good feeling
6333349 i think the stuff we do in between starts has allowed him to get to this point and his arm is feeling good
6333350 what makes us rich as a society is what we know and what we can do anything that stands in the way of the dissemination of knowledge is a real problem
6333351 ive watched sammy throughout the years tying him its ok i guess
6333352 everybody else does im more concerned about getting hits and getting on base you get hits and home runs happen but it is good to get the first one at home
6333353 im country where i grew up i was told to be polite to everybody
6333354 i feel good that game is behind me and i feel very fortunate they gave me another shot
6333355 we started doing rice but we didnt do very much mostly cotton soybeans and corn youll see me wearing cotton shorts around im a big fan of cotton
6333356 thats where a lot of hard nosed players come from
6333357 i feel great i knew there was nothing seriously wrong with it
6333358 we need him to get back on the mound to be honest he could use a break you hate to have it happen this way
6333359 it was bang bang it was by hundredths of a second but i could do it
6333360 with this certain starting product devise a mechanism to create this ending product
6333361 the groups position as a global leader in nickel and palladium its no 4 position as a platinum producer and its significant role in the production of copper cobalt rhodium and other metals
6333362 from its large high grade reserve base which supports massive production product diversity and low costs
6333363 has retained comfortable credit metrics thanks to very strong free operating cash flow of 6 3 billion as a result of exceptionally high metals prices in the course of the year as well as a prudent decision to sell 1 8 billion in treasury shares
6333364 are the main rating constraint so far these disagreements have had only a limited impacted on norilsks financial policy in our view norilsk is unlikely to merge with united company rusal or any other entity such as metalloinvest at least over the short term
6333365 other rating constraints include the cyclical nature of the mining industry and institutional risks in russia where norilsks core assets are based
6333366 norilsk is well positioned to address country risk with 92 of metal revenues coming from exports a fair degree of autonomy in energy and logistics and improving international diversity following recent acquisitions
6333367 in addition norilsk has a track record of managing russian political risk the group has attracted government funding for a railway at the chita project and appointed former minister vladimir strzhalkovsky as ceo in august 2008
6333368 healthy supported by high cash flow generation and considerable cash reserves
6333369 at the same date cash reserves had increased to almost 6 billion due to high cash flow generation the company also has about 400 million in treasury stock on its balance sheet and more than 2 billion in available credit lines
6333370 this provide good flexibility to pay the remaining 0 8 billion of a 1 6 billion dividend declared on the groups 2007 income
6333371 even though lower metal prices and growing capital expenditure are likely to reduce free operating cash flow from the record levels of 2007
6333372 we expect norilsk to maintain a competitive cost position amid rising global industry costs thanks to ongoing efficiency improvement and a fair degree of infrastructural autonomy
6333373 the uncertainty about the groups shareholding structure is constraining the possibility of a rating rise which would otherwise hinge on continuation of norilsks solid operating and financial performance and the benefits of its on going investments
6333374 on the date that the decision was made to close the hedge book the mark to market of the book had fallen to approximately a48 m us41 85 m
6333375 the company is confident that the broken hill operations can be sustained to maintain a level of continuity of production and one that is financially viable at current metal prices for at least the next two to three years without significant compromise to the longer term life of mine
6333376 should metal prices increase in the future we will be in a strong position to ramp up production and to utilise the full potential of the broken hill concentrator with ore sources from the southern operations potosi the north mine and flying doctor
6333377 to provide the most cost effective retention of expertise and asset management
6333378 god onze redder die wil dat alle mensen worden gered en de waarheid leren kennen
6333379 wij kennen die goede vrijdag die voor christenen onlosmakelijk verbonden is met het kruis maar ook de niet christen de athe st weet van die dag dat is te zeggen dat hij weet heeft van het onrecht van het nooit aflatende lijden van verspilling van het wrede raadsel van het einde dat alles heeft de geschiedenis van het mensdom gestempeld en dat is nog steeds bepalend voor ons leven van alledag wij hebben weet van lijden liefdeloosheid en eenzaamheid die onlosmakelijk verbonden zijn met onze historie en onze persoonlijke levensloop maar wij hebben ook weet van de paaszondag voor christenen is die dag een teken van opstanding van rechtvaardigheid van liefde waardoor de dood is overwonnen nu nog is dat teken zowel zeker als betwijfeld zowel duidelijk als onbegrijpelijk die zondag wordt gekenmerkt door het woord hoop er is geen ander woord dat zo opbouwend is maar wij zijn bezit aan de lange reis van de zaterdag
6333380 media transforms experiences even thought itself the ability to probe deeply into research questions for example into atomized products suitable for the logistical processing that has expanded the markets for other goods
6333381 in their research the authors found that for brands to affect behavior they need to be associated with behavior that the subjects already found desirable so the secret to avoiding having brands manipulate us perhaps is to aspire to be no one
6333382 any attempts to present ideas to the public all take on commercial overtones
6333383 the problem with hipsters is not their fashion following phoniness its their smug abdication of responsibility in favor of an egocentric apathy hipsters are conservatives posturing as progressives often professing to be liberals while their practice refutes the claim
6333384 the aggressiveness of advertising forces hipsters into aggressive countermoves quick shifts in allegiance to avoid seeming like marketings dupes eventually collaborating with the forces of marketing or conceiving of yourself as a brand becomes an even more sophisticated strategy for evading marketings manipulation becoming collaborators becomes a kind of advanced subversive strategy
6333385 the thirty six dramatic situations is a descriptive list which was created by georges polti to categorize every dramatic situation that might occur in a story or performance
6333386 yes we do have a tendency to over correct in the corporate world
6333387 what happens to contemporary culture when we run out of these semiotic
6333388 a lot of creativity and cultural innovation in our world was predicated on a contest between the center and the margin mainstream and avant garde middle class and artist class age and youth privilege and risk tedium and imagination orthodoxy and departure but things have changed
6333389 hes put up the wall to ensure that he always has the wide ocean view because youll never be able to rent this
6333390 wherever we go it has been misty may and kerri walsh from day one said walsh who played on the u
6333391 to be by her side she makes me a better person a better player we have something special
6333392 i can say yes this has got to top it
6333393 the rain makes it better we felt like warriors out there
6333394 i hope we dont stop after we have babies i hope we keep going walsh 30 said
6333395 the world has gotten so much better at beach volleyball walsh said
6333396 the teams are so much better than they were four years ago
6333397 obviously the pole belongs to the city and we can take code enforcement action on that if we need to
6333398 issues are important but you also have to look at character
6333399 our leaders used to be known for the integrity honest abe or george washington
6333400 does the private life of a leader matter absolutely it matters because what you do affects everybody else even in your private life
6333401 i guess the better question to ask is will either john mccain or obama do anything about abortion
6333402 on several key issues i am in complete disagreement with sen obama
6333403 but i am very interested in what he has to say
6333404 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him
6333405 some humility in how we approach the issue of confronting evil you know a lot of evil has been perpetrated based on the claim that we were trying to confront evil
6333406 some of the richest people ive ever known are the most unhappy i think that rich is defined by should be defined by a home a good job and education and the ability to hand our children a more prosperous and safer world than the one that we inherited
6333407 i could not vote for an atheist because an atheist says i dont need god and nobody is self sufficient enough to be a president by themselves
6333408 help us restore function to the disabled and fight disease can also be used to bring in the brave new world in which what it means to be human made in the image of god is fundamentally lost
6333409 blending human nature and machine nature through such means as the implanting of brain chips for memory skills or communication could compound both the intelligence and the wealth of a small segment of society
6333410 to a new feudalism in which power of all kinds is concentrated in the hands of enhanced persons
6333411 at the heart of the agenda for the 21st century lies the need to build a policy framework in which ethical principles set the ground rules for our use of these new powers
6333412 lazy hands make a man poor but diligent hands bring wealth
6333413 any enterprise is built by wise planning becomes strong through common sense and profits wonderfully by keeping abreast of the facts
6333414 what do i want my kids to know about money
6333415 in some ways the use of money proves our love for god more conclusively than depth of knowledge length of prayers or prominence of service these things can be feigned but the use of our possessions shows us up for what we actually are
6333416 but whoever has the worlds goods and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against him how does the love of god abide in him little children let us not love with word or with tongue but in deed and truth

6333420 historical commons did not necessarily pursue equity and were focused especially on the attempt to find an equilibrium between human pressures and the provision capabilities of the natural resources whereas after the liberal revolution 18th 19th centuries the commons became synonymous with equitable uses the idea of equity represents indeed the core of the renewed vision of the community that emerged in the last century and still dominates todays communitarian worldviews herv s h vgl beitrag von j m lana berasain zum allmendmangement im ebrotal welche gleichheits und gerechtigkeitsvorstellungen der heutigen commonsdebatte zu grunde liegen dar ber wird noch viel zu diskutieren sein was in der commonsforschung europas fehlt forschungen zur fischerei dieser wahren

6333422 ive been doing a lot of program api design work lately in my favorite medium a sommaire
6333423 weve got to reflect and see the papers of the meeting to get a real understanding of what has been said
6333424 clearly this isnt the outcome the project would have wanted everybody the council the school and the trustees are going to have to go away from this meeting and consider how we can deliver a landmark school for newbury
6333425 my great fear is that we would have to come back to this committee with another redesigned school we would come back to you with what i have seen up and down the country from tyneside to the south coast which is a shed

6333624 theyve gone out and announced theyre going to set the benchmark so theyre the ones putting pressure on themselves
6333625 theyre probably capable of backing it up because theyve recruited possibly the best out of the whole league with the quality and experience theyve bought
6333626 but i just hope they put their best team out against us so we can look to exploit any of the weaknesses theyve got left in them if there are any
6333627 if i cop a bit of niggle theyre probably going to get a bit back but theres no hard feelings its just all part of the game and im looking forward to playing against a very good friend of mine like iain fyfe and the other guys that are still there from when i was there

6333643 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6333644 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6333645 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6333646 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6333647 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it

6333675 good value for the number of cool things you get tinker around with and improve your system
6333676 macpilot keeps getting better with each release and it seems to be growing exponentially faster than some of the other similar products keep up the great work
6333677 i really like mac pilot great product every time i used it there was always something new i discovered could be done with the software a truly swiss army knife utility
6333678 this utility and what else does one need anymore just keeps getting better and better ive stopped using everything else i once bought
6333679 macpilot offers so many features all in one application no need to pay for other apps when this one can do so many things i especially like the advanced customization features
6333680 this does so many things that it is likely there is something on the list that will help you
6333681 this looks like it does a lot more than cocktail or onyx each program has its niche area so i guess i can use all three together nicely
6333682 its amazing how many useful options are in the screenshot alone hard to believe that apple leaves so much out in order to simplify the user experience
6333683 i use this app regularly all options and functions to tweak my system are available from one easy interface it really isnt as intimidating as it looks once you get down to taking a look at it
6333684 ive tried other apps like macpilot but nothing compares to or gets updated as much as good ol mp
6333685 i think its the best tool for the job great interface easy to handle tons of functions at your mouse click
6333686 as an old windows user i need cut feature great little app
6333687 macpilot was one of the first applications i bought when i made the switch
6333688 im not sure id use macpilot to enable hidden features in leopard but i certainly would use it for optimizing my system
6333689 this software does come in handy to tweak os x
6333690 ive always been an onyx user since they took so long to get up to speed with leopard i switched to macpilot no regrets just the finder tweaks alone make this app worth the money of course i also like the safari tweaks too
6333691 looks like a rather essential corner cutter to me tons of options to tweak the basic mac os interface
6333692 looking forward to getting under the hood of my macpro system this tool looks very useful for a tuneup
6333693 this app rocks it has almost every tweak in it that you will ever need to make modifications to the os without having to touch plist files
6333694 macpilots interface seems a bit daunting at first due to the amount of options that it makes available to you but for most of us its easier and better than remembering an obscure terminal command
6333695 this could be extremely useful i tend to script these things myself would be nice to have it automated
6333696 congrats on your new macpilot its a really nice app
6333697 i think macpilot is a good application to optimize the mac it is helpful to check and repair the system
6333698 i find macpilot to have several features in it that make it worth its license purchasing as you would be purchasing seperate applications to gain what macpilot has to offer e
6333699 its definitely nice to have everything in one program instead of having to use 3 or 4
6333700 i am quite new to mac macpilot seems to be a very good utility useful and simple to use
6333701 the one thing i really like about macpilot is that it has a very easy ui time stretched people like myself really appreciate an app thats easy and quick to use despite the fact that there may be other apps out there that do similar things macpilot is well set out is a no brainer and is simply quicker to use
6333702 thanks for a great little program that lets me do things i didnt even know i wanted to do
6333703 the unique options are hidden features in mail safari and address book as well as control of logs and caches
6333704 the perfect swiss army knife for the mac dont run your mac without macpilot
6333705 the developer must be glowing blue white by now amazing collection of features kudos

6333714 locking both low income pupils and vocational education into second class status
6333715 what is particularly striking about the entire approach in the gcse game is just how anti education it is
6333716 the value of participating in a course is insignificant compared to the grade the pupil gains at the end of the course thats why lower performers are being encouraged to do pointless vocational courses

6333723 with sports utility vehicles theres probably a delayed reaction compared to passenger cars
6333724 certainly the slump in car sales in july wasnt just the result of a slowing economy as the increase in the luxury car tax caused buyers to bring forward purchases into june
6333725 but no doubt the gloomy mood of consumers also had a lot to do with the fact that car sales slumped in the latest month

6333748 gov john baldacci said monday he would propose lowering maines personal income taxes in the january session of the maine legislature but how much depends on the state budget now being developed
6333749 we have been debating tax relief and tax reform for quite some time
6333750 and i think that now is the time for action
6333751 a tough talking gov john baldacci vowed wednesday to make tax relief his top priority for the 2005 legislative session saying he will keep the legislature in session as long as it takes to get the job done
6333752 weve got to get rid of the albatross on maines back which is this tax burden
6333753 gov john baldacci said this week that lowering the state income tax is a priority heading into the next legislative session

6333759 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 metres i understand the joy he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man

6333772 not just in the midcoast but beyond they had the biggest economic impact in maine since its hard to imagine
6333773 before mbna there was a concern for years about the old decaying mill
6333774 in 1992 the town was struggling with what to do and the progress was very slow
6333775 mbna changed the landscape over night they moved so fast
6333776 mbna in coming in and developing facilities improved a lot of real estate significantly in town
6333777 most big national companies that come in would just hire national service companies to do the work for them
6333778 they hired locals to do things they made it a point to do business locally and they challenged local businesses and contractors to step it up 300 percent
6333779 i thought we needed a shot of that we were asked to achieve things we had never done before
6333780 before mbna came to our community belfast camden and rockland practically shut down for the winter
6333781 people now look at belfast as more than a chicken factory town
6333782 without mbna putting up the front money it wouldnt have been possible
6333783 ive never seen anything else like it before or since
6333784 communities have rallied before caught the attention of corporate giants and preserved what they had
6333785 belfast has earned a great reputation with mbna to bank of america we are unknown we need to become known
6333786 we have an aging population and health sciences is a growth area in our stagnant economy
6333787 i have the good sense to be willing to say thank you to them long after they left
6333788 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6333789 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6333790 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6333791 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6333792 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference

6333796 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6333797 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6333798 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6333799 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now

6333802 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6333803 that hairline difference between nuance and what appears to be flip flopping is hurting him with liberal voters
6333804 conservatives were supposed to be the bigger problem for mccain
6333805 obama still has work to do on his base at this point mccain seems to be doing a better job with his
6333806 there were no wild swings there isnt one group that is radically different than last month or even two months ago it was just a steady decline for obama across the board
6333807 were flagging that the year 2009 has started well and july and the best part of august have been very strong and thats across hospitals and pathology

6333814 est claro que la inflaci n de momento no se est moderando no hay m s que ver las cifras de ipc que se conocieron la semana pasada y los r cords en los precios industriales en alemania y estados unidos nosotros pensamos que vamos a ver una inflaci n bastante elevada en los pr ximos seis meses y algo m s moderada en 2009
6333815 hay que tener en cuenta que estos productos est n ligados a la inflaci n pero tambi n a la evoluci n de los bonos en un contexto en el que existen expectativas de que los bancos centrales mantengan los tipos e incluso de que los bajen y en el que la renta variable es tan inestable la renta fija deber a comportarse bien
6333816 razonable no ya a corto plazo sino sobre todo a medio plazo invertir en bonos ligados a inflaci n
6333817 invertir al menos dos terceras partes de su patrimonio en una cartera diversificada de valores de renta fija indexados a la inflaci n con diversos vencimientos emitidos por gobiernos sus entes u organismos y por empresas

6333834 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
6333835 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
6333836 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
6333837 we just dont have as much money as we used to
6333838 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
6333839 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
6333840 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
6333841 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
6333842 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
6333843 we are not staying home with our children by default
6333844 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
6333845 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
6333846 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
6333847 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
6333848 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
6333849 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
6333850 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
6333851 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
6333852 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals

6333858 early in the season his average wasnt there but he was hitting home runs and swinging the bat well with men in scoring position
6333859 he was still being productive although his numbers may not have looked as good but this last month or six weeks hes been pretty awesome
6333860 its not a pleasant situation because you know how valuable he is
6333861 and we dont have a whole lot of depth on our bench right now
6333862 nicky made a very good play and castro sold it he deked the guy
6333863 we learned that last year because we were the recipient of them doing that to us so whats good for the goose is good for the gander
6333864 he didnt catch it so why should i care if he had a shot or not
6333865 i didnt even see him i knew it was over the wall so i just kept jogging
6333866 i hope people wake up and emotionally engage in issues
6333867 its about the issues that everyones talking about but theres a lot of hope
6333868 at this moment in my life writing about anything else would be uninteresting and impossible because i feel such urgency
6333869 there was healthy competition among artists to create art that was commercial and political at the same time
6333870 our music now is not representing the times at least not socially and politically or maybe were just distracted
6333871 these musicians speak to millions of people every day so for them to use their voices to inspire people is a key part of our program
6333872 bon je vais aller mater le catalogue la redoute huit
6333873 it used to be the term stay at home mother was an oxymoron because you had to get out of the house for your sanity
6333874 to the mall the playground playdates to target just to go somewhere
6333875 if youre a stay at home mother youd better have a darned good reason to go somewhere you wonder where can i stop by on my way home from another errand
6333876 we just dont have as much money as we used to
6333877 i was famous for running here and there to get ingredients
6333878 if i was missing something id run out and get it i dont do that anymore i sit down and plan meals two weeks ahead then buy everything at once
6333879 ive always wanted to be a stay at home mom
6333880 if your supposition is that the prospects arent good anyway
6333881 i know tons and tons of mothers who choose to stay home whatever the economic difficulties
6333882 we are not staying home with our children by default
6333883 stay at home moms are very good at being frugal
6333884 often theyre the ones in charge of household finances but when youre worried that the one paycheck wont come its that much more frightening
6333885 there are times when i think if i were back at work i could afford this or that
6333886 but i dont think it would pan out in the end
6333887 we had a date night for a while once a week but it petered out
6333888 maybe it was my birthday in may last year not this year
6333889 to find a job that pays something decent i would still have to drive an hour each way at 4 30 a gallon
6333890 i go to five places in one day with three kids its horrible
6333891 how can we justify eating out when we could go to a store and buy enough for a couple days worth of meals
6333892 theres just no time to regroup none left for ourselves
6333893 ive watched sammy throughout the years tying him its ok i guess
6333894 one of the crucial pieces of feedback obtained from the survey was that when making the decision to hire access equipment the key factor was the reliability of the equipment at site to this end lavendon access services will continue to differentiate themselves from other powered access providers and benefit customers by striving to improve the current high levels of reliability
6333895 through following the 5s procedures sort set standardise shine and sustain each depot will find that improved organisation will lead to improved health amp safety working areas and better all round performance the 5s programme is tried and tested by other major companies such as boeing and hewlett packard and as results so far have been so positive it is an initiative we are certainly set to continue
6333896 i dont think we were disrespectful or ignorant of him i do understand that now hes on the dl so i called him
6333897 i dont want to see a kid go on the dl anyway not if i have something to do with it but i dont want them to go on the dl anyway
6333898 he just was concerned and he wanted to make sure he didnt have anything to do with it
6333899 but that was just another step in the process being a lefty specialist and only getting 40 whatever innings the last few years and then all of the sudden having 50 already its just that on top of everything else
6333900 its a little bit more of a pressure situation but the eighth inning is the same as the ninth inning i think
6333901 its a long season and everybody has their ups and downs and its just one of those things youve got to work through and hopefully get better at and hopefully i think it just makes you a better person after what you go through
6333902 very exciting im still trying to figure out how to control my emotions
6333903 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6333904 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector
6333905 marriage marks the end of many short follies being one long stupidity
6333906 when a woman steals your husband there is no better revenge than to let her keep him

6333910 call into work late wednesday morning because it was a lineup that couldnt be missed
6333911 i think indian stocks are starting to find bottom around that 13 000 14 000 level the big problem for india is inflation which remains in the system and that is prompting speculation of further interest rate increases from reserve bank of india
6333912 but we are saying we are doing a lot of exciting things now so i would expect people to be cautious about selling
6333913 these instances get attention because they cut against the grain the trend is overwhelmingly in the other direction
6333914 its very possible for a well meaning manager to shove the employee out of the corporate jet without a parachute
6333915 problems with cross selling inappropriate products such as annuities or long term care insurance policies to seniors who take out reverse mortgages have caused enough concern that a provision was added to the housing and economic recovery act of 2008 restricting such practices
6333916 financial companies must also institute firewalls to prevent the cross selling of reverse mortgages with other financial products loan limits for reverse mortgages were raised and more funding was provided for counseling consumers seeking reverse mortgages
6333917 our records compliance and reuse was declining every year to deliver to our expanded customer base of 36 000 users using the old system our records team would have to grow from 42 staff to over 700
6333918 our backups used to run from friday night into saturday afternoon there was no information lifecycle management and it was keen to delete information from the network but found it difficult knowing what could be deleted
6333919 the records management unit no longer owns and administers the system records staff are now end users who perform all document and file creation
6333920 grant me the serenity to accept the things i cannot change courage to change the things i can and wisdom to know the difference
6333921 id rather be hated for who i am then loved for who im not
6333922 dont take your life to seriously nobody makes it out alive anyways
6333923 remember youll never be as young as you are right now
6333924 do not wait for the last judgment it takes place every day
6333925 well have four perhaps five generations of family members there
6333926 i had an old chevy it wasnt running very fast
6333927 i had to wait for him a couple of years
6333928 i had to light the fire in the morning and be the janitor and the teacher
6333929 i got the horse to run but when we got to school he wouldnt stop so the first snowbank we came to i slid off
6333930 my cousin invited me to hemet for the ramona pageant
6333931 i asked my cousin to fix me up with one of the indian dancers
6333932 i hocked a camera to make the down payment on a ring
6333933 i sat on the edge of the bed and asked them

6333938 the australian communications and media authority acma has strong concerns about the broadcast in australia of programmes that contain terrorist related content
6333939 we treat them like any other broadcasters who request to use indosats transponder theres no special issue here our review shows that they al manar are meeting the criteria as our customers so its a pure business deal
6333940 al manar is similar to al jazeera bbc and cnn they are television broadcasters
6333941 we are also monitoring its contents and its good to have a balance of news from america and the west
6333942 we can issue a notice to an overseas based service provider we would confront that situation when we are confronted with it i cant really discuss a hypothetical situation
6333943 the television station al manar backed by the terrorist organisation hezbollah goes beyond the acceptable limits of free speech
6333944 the accusations that are directed at the station that it advocates suicide bombings i think if it does that it does it in the context of using whatever means are available in order to defend their territory

6333948 in the early stages several events have seen a fairly low seat occupancy because of their unfavorable timing either too early or too late
6333949 quite a number of sport events are performed in almost full venues
6333950 i was very happy when i won the medal i ran fast
6333951 then they told me they sent a protest in and i lost my medal
6333952 it is a pity for a big country like the us to make such a small statement
6333953 if i stepped on the line they would do it the same time they did it with spearmon so thats why i still dont understand
6333954 i am more bullish than bearish i think the market has too quickly discounted geopolitical risks and was too concerned with demand destruction we should be trending back towards 120 125 a barrel
6333955 we see the big picture of demand destruction in the u s but there is also a lot of bullish news that is driving the market
6333956 there are still tropical storms forming in the atlantic and the hurricane season will last until november
6333957 we got a point the last time we played chelsea and im looking forward to playing against them again who knows we might get all three this time
6333958 we have to get behind him and support him because he is a tremendous force and has tremendous importance for the team
6333959 what happened in the transfer period did not always reflect his deep desire and overall i am positive he will recover
6333960 there are things he stretched but mostly he told the truth
6333961 offal is vile filth which i will eat under no circumstances

6333964 the selectivity and politicizing of its activities were in danger of bringing the entire un system into disrepute

6333966 they can become a pc tech or maybe a help desk person but this is not going to catapult them into the top reaches of the it hierarchy
6333967 the more complex the subject matter the higher the upside
6333968 is this person a success how much of this persons success is due to the training
6333969 some schools will shine in that area and others wont
6333970 try to figure out realistically what will make you comfortable and happy
6333971 picking the wrong field is probably more dangerous than picking the wrong school

6333975 it is very good news that silva and villa will be staying here instead of being sold
6333976 to hold it here and feed it and then somehow get it to antarctica where it would learn to feed on krill is simply impossible
6333977 and i think it is often the kindest the most humane thing to do is to euthanize the animal and prevent it just suffering a very long protracted starvation and death
6333978 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6333979 i was not at the scene when the incident took place
6333980 approximately 200 civilians were seen fleeing the area including women and children
6333981 i have won at championships but an olympic medal is more difficult because all the competitors are here i was in good condition
6333982 the weather had no influence on me it was better than a sunny and hot day
6333983 i didnt want to waste my energy so i gave it 50 per cent
6333984 in these circumstances its normal that things arent so easy

6334087 when you dig a hole you always end up with more material at the end thats known as swell or bulking
6334088 the materials are laid down over thousands of years by nature and even when we return it as wet slurry which is one of the better ways to return materials to compact it doesnt return back to the same volume
6334089 the life of a mining operation can take 10 15 years so from where you start and finish is a long way apart
6334090 swell is one of the big things we have to deal with its a timing issue
6334091 simply do not accept crls assertions about excess sand and not being able to deal with swell all of a sudden after 42 years of mining without having to export sand
6334092 it is true sand swells temporarily so if you put it all back in future years it wont all fit back in the dunes you have taken away but the sand does subside over time back to its original density of dunes
6334093 but dealing with swell is not a timing issue it is inherent in the mining process you displace sand you increase the volume
6334094 the environmental authority ea which crl has formally committed itself to obliges the company to replace the landscape it destroys through mining end of story
6334095 the rehabilitated landform will not be the same as the pre mine topography
6334096 it will still be constructed to criteria that are consistent with the geomorphology of the surrounding area and therefore will keep in character with the island as per the approved landform criteria
6334097 regardless of the projects success we will be able to meet the rehabilitation criteria requirements for our mine however with this project approved we would be able to return a greater percentage of the disturbed land closer to its natural topography
6334098 thats a very conveniently made statement which would be laudable if it were true
6334099 the point is they are not reinstating the landscape as per what was there before
6334100 now mining deeper than ever and thereby displacing vastly greater amounts of sand
6334101 we think if they werent mining so deep as deep as three or four metres below sea level and displacing so much sand then they wouldnt have a problem putting the topography back to reform the landscape
6334102 tip the so called excess sand into the end of mine void
6334103 at the end of every mine there is a great big hole left with all the dug out material having been thrown out behind the mine path and with nothing left at hand to fill in the void
6334104 enterprise mine will end in a great void at precisely the point where the two stockpiles are located because the mine path bends back on itself
6334105 therefore it would be a simple matter for crl to tip the so called excess sand into the end of mine void that will be adjacent to the opts but the company says that would be too expensive
6334106 its easy for environmentalists to make comments like that but they dont have to justify the economics thats the benefit of being an action group i guess
6334107 really its so simple it might be hard to grasp on a sand island there is no such thing as excess sand
6334108 one of the critical concerns is the aquifer which stores groundwater under the island which is itself composed of sand
6334109 it isnt a water body it isnt a hollow with a lake underneath it is water thats embedded in and around the sand
6334110 how can we know the impacts of taking away so much sand on these different environmental systems
6334111 while ecosystems are resilient and variable until we understand better the range of changes that the various biota plants mammals amphibia reptilia birds fish and invertebrates will tolerate it is difficult to be more certain about what changes the islands ecosystems will tolerate
6334112 all of the biota in the groundwater dependent ecosystems is dependent either directly or indirectly on the present naturally variable hydrological regime
6334113 we can mine in the aquifer but we monitor very closely so we dont raise or lower it too much outside of natural range
6334114 the mining lease has to be renewed because we have an obligation to complete rehabilitation and if we dont complete rehabilitation we cant relinquish that land to np
6334115 stradbroke to date has been exploited rather than protected and wed like to see that turned around
6334116 we think np status is a good idea and will continue to work with state government to slowly implement and progressively hand over areas from our leases
6334117 it seems this county is so caught up in its own agenda it cannot look at the real issues

6334143 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

6334153 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6334154 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6334155 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6334156 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6334157 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6334158 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6334159 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6334160 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6334161 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6334162 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6334171 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6334172 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6334173 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
6334174 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
6334175 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
6334176 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
6334177 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
6334178 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6334179 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6334180 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6334181 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6334182 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6334183 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6334184 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6334185 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6334186 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
6334187 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
6334188 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6334189 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6334190 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6334191 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6334192 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6334193 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6334194 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6334195 arques fokussiert 2008 angesichts schwieriger rahmenbedingungen auf eine verbesserung der bilanzstruktur und des cashflows in diesem zusammenhang sind wir im ersten halbjahr bereits deutlich vorangekommen weiterhin f hren wir nat rlich viel versprechende gespr che bei einigen akquisitions und exit kandidaten
6334196 con pasar a la final me dar a con un canto en los dientes
6334197 dont say that you want to give but go ahead and give youll never catch up with a mere hope
6334198 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
6334199 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6334200 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6334201 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6334202 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6334203 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6334204 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6334205 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
6334206 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
6334207 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
6334208 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
6334209 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6334210 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6334211 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
6334212 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

6334221 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6334222 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6334223 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6334224 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6334225 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6334226 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6334227 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6334228 who are open to doing something on the production side
6334229 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6334230 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6334231 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6334232 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6334233 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6334234 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6334235 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6334236 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6334237 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6334238 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6334239 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6334240 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6334241 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6334242 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6334243 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6334244 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6334245 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6334246 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6334247 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6334248 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6334249 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6334250 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6334251 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

6334263 to win this award for the fourth consecutive year is a fantastic achievement proving yet again that emirates significant investment in the inflight entertainment product is appreciated by our customers

6334265 the standards of inflight entertainment have improved considerably across the airline industry in recent years and passengers simply expect their chosen airline to provide avod programming so product differentiation becomes more difficult to achieve for the world leaders in this section

6334280 the polyketal microparticles we developed are simply a vehicle to get the drugs inside the body to the diseased area as quickly as possible
6334281 the major advantage is that they degrade into biocompatible compounds that dont accumulate in a patients tissue or cause additional inflammation
6334282 we think these microparticles are going to be fantastic for oral drug delivery because they can survive the stomach conditions before they release their contents in the intestines
6334283 patients with acute liver failure need drugs as soon as possible or else theyll die
6334284 weve tailored the polyketals hydrolysis rates to deliver the drug in one or two days

6334290 i am not too disappointed because the result is fair in the second half we were also under pressure from norway
6334291 it was difficult for him to see with the rain
6334292 at half time i told our players to be careful for the spectators i felt it was right to play on
6334293 before i came the team had lost games and some players didnt want to come back but now the senior players are happy and that is good for morale its important for us to have belief
6334294 but the skills that ive got i should beat him every day right
6334295 its 4 1 but two of those have been in ireland
6334296 i think it was 10 9 in a four nations semi final and 23 20 in the
6334297 but i gave away 14 points too didnt want to do that in this one
6334298 so the tactics were perfect tie in the fella close him down and he played straight into my hands soon as the bell went he came straight at me it was perfect because im pretty strong in the zone
6334299 if anyone steps in and trades with me theres probably only going to be one winner
6334300 last time he fought degale he boxed him and degale was expecting a fight but darren boxed him hes well capable of doing both
6334301 i had no life so i started to question what i was doing because all my eggs were in one basket
6334302 i was in with secondary school children some who hadnt even done transition year so they were only fifteen and i had to wear the uniform ive only one picture that my mom took and i wouldnt let her take it anywhere
6334303 after being in hospital and not thinking that i would see properly again this is childs play
6334304 and he was the perfect guy my supposed nemesis but i didnt fear him
6334305 because it was redemption the world championship was a low point for me and probably for irish boxing at the time we underperformed and everyone was writing us off writing off the high performance
6334306 rhodium is used most often for this kind of catalyst and it costs around 9 000 an ounce our catalyst costs around 9 a kg
6334307 there are many practical issues that need to be resolved before we can use hydrogen as fuel how to make it how to transport it how to create the infrastructure for people to fill their cars with it
6334308 our research lends itself to whats called a distributed production strategy instead of making hydrogen from biofuel at a centralized facility and transporting it to gas stations we could use our catalyst inside reactors that are actually located at the gas stations
6334309 so we wouldnt have to transport or store the hydrogen we could store the biofuel and make hydrogen on the spot
6334310 precious metals have high catalytic activity and in most cases high stability but theyre also very expensive so our goal from the outset was to come up with a precious metal free catalyst
6334311 whenever a process works at a lower temperature that brings energy savings and cost savings
6334312 also if the catalyst is highly active and can achieve high hydrogen yields we dont need as much of it that will bring down the size of the reactor and its cost

6334324 reproductive dysfunctions include a range of menstrual disorders sexual dysfunctions and pregnancy complications that include spontaneous abortion or miscarriage
6334325 teenagers who drink tend to have disruptions in their menstrual cycle as well as unplanned pregnancies
6334326 higher rates of reproductive dysfunction in adult women may reflect the cumulative effects of longer exposure to alcohol for older women than for female adolescents
6334327 to our knowledge this is the first study to examine alcohols effects on reproductive onset across reproductive development most previous research has examined risks to teens or adults but not both our findings highlight a risk associated with ad in women that is not widely recognized a risk that has assumed increasing importance given the increased rates of alcohol misuse by women and particularly young women

6334371 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6334372 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car

6334382 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6334383 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6334384 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6334385 why is it beyond the wit of our country to be able to provide the resources and encouragement in supporting australians who are unemployed to go to areas where they can get seasonal work

6334463 because of john mccain corruption was exposed and people like jack abramoff went to jail

6334711 e lo stesso di quando giocava in brasile buon segno
6334712 molto perch avrei voluto esserci a pechino dunga mi aveva chiamato ma mourinho non mi ha lasciato andare perch ha chiesto di avere la rosa al completo fin dal primo giorno di ritiro ho obbedito ma in effetti stata dura le olimpiadi sono lunico titolo che ancora manca in brasile cera grande attesa purtroppo finita ancora male daltronde brasile argentina una di quelle gare senza pronostico pu finire in ogni modo
6334713 tipico in brasile in campionato ci sono squadre che cambiano pi tecnici durante la stessa stagione basta una gara storta per mettere tutto in discussione io credo che dunga stia facendo invece benissimo ha gi vinto una coppa america e in generale ha perso pochissimo
6334714 il metodo di lavoro diverso con silvino pi vario a livello di esercizi quasi mai si fa la stessa cosa con giulio prima di iniziare lallenamento sapevamo esattamente cosa avremmo fatto il primo mi ricorda molto i tempi brasiliani ma confronti non ne faccio anche perch vengo da due grandi stagioni sotto la guida di nuciari
6334715 siamo molto solidi questo vero e pensare che abbiamo fuori quasi tutta la difesa certo abbiamo scoperto di avere in cambiasso unarma in pi lui davvero eccezionale ma io naturalmente spero che i nostri centrali rientrino al pi presto comunque anche lanno scorso prendevamo pochi gol la nostra era sempre la miglior difesa

6334717 difetti ne ho ma non li rivelo altrimenti gli attaccanti ne approfittano per quanto riguarda il discorso dei pregi porto nel cuore la gara di napoli feci una sciocchezza clamorosa dopo pochi secondi ma da quel momento in poi parai tutto compreso un rigore perdemmo ma personalmente fu comunque una serata da ricordare perch la qualit pi grande di un portiere quella di saper reagire con glaciale freddezza anche alla pi ridicola delle papere

6334893 in terms of car set up we need to remember that like monaco the track will be green and dusty on the opening day of practice
6334894 that sometimes tempts you into playing with set up more than you would like so you need to resist that temptation and let the track come to the car
6334895 the most important thing is to be thorough methodical and iterative
6334896 although we arrive at a new race track having undertaken a huge amount of research and armed with an enormous amount of data the reality is its really only the starting point for our engineering team
6334897 we begin practice the way we would at any other circuit but in this instance we need to pay particular attention both to driver feedback and the data generated from the car
6334898 the important thing is not to react too hastily its vital you dont end up going down the wrong path because you only have a limited amount of time to tune the set up before qualifying
6334899 anybody whos studied onboard footage of the circuit will be mindful of the proximity of the concrete barriers in certain areas

6334905 thats something that really engages the people and fans far more than at a purpose built circuit out of town
6334906 we are targeting 9 per cent growth getting up to 10 per cent it may look ambitious with the global economic slowdown but in the medium term it is achievable
6334907 i am sure we will be able to handle that
6334908 we needed to win before we went to premadasa for the remainder of the series there was lot of pressure on us but zaheer did the job for us we would have loved to win comfortably but nevertheless we would take this
6334909 we didnt want to put pressure on anyone and even called off the team meeting you can discuss 1 000 things and that itself can put pressure on you we just allowed everyone to mentally prepare for the game
6334910 promoting myself up the order worked but credit should go to badri subramaniam badrinath he batted well on debut he hadnt played muralitharan and mendis before and its good to see him doing so well
6334911 its good to have a break ahead of the next game if we had lost here we would have been really down
6334912 you need to be consistent my responsibility is to provide early breakthroughs i just bowled within myself it was important to keep in the right areas and i thought all the bowlers did well to restrict sri lanka
6334913 this is a wicket that we are not used to its very fresh wicket that makes batting a bit difficult but its a good wicket and has a good bounce you need to survive against the new ball
6334914 at one stage it was nicely set up after reducing them for 75 for five we could have won the game but that partnership for the sixth wicket was crucial that took the game away from us

6334930 despite fierce opposition from moscow the united states and poland signed a long stalled agreement on wednesday to place an american missile defence base on polish territory
6334931 the kremlin has levelled sustained criticism against the american plan characterising it as a hostile act near the russian border but american officials insist that the system will defend against threats from countries like iran and would not target russia
6334932 missile defence of course is aimed at no one said the secretary of state condoleezza rice who signed the agreement in warsaw with her polish counterpart the foreign minister radek sikorski it is in our defence that we do this
6334933 ms rice also spoke of the deepening friendship between the united states and poland
6334934 even before the agreement was reached the bush administration had proposed spending 712 million in the coming fiscal year to start digging silos in poland installing a related radar system in the czech republic another former soviet satellite that is now a nato member and buying initial parts for the first interceptor missiles
6334935 but democrats are now questioning all that spending as premature
6334936 go ahead and move on with research and development said representative ellen o tauscher the democrat of california who is chairwoman of the house subcommittee that oversees the missile defence programme
6334937 russia has warned that a us polish missile defence deal creates a new arms race in europe and beyond
6334938 a foreign ministry statement said that moscow will be forced to react and not only through diplomatic demarches it did not elaborate
6334939 the russian foreign ministry said the planned missile shield was aimed at weakening moscow describing it as part of us efforts to change the strategic balance of power in its favour
6334940 it said the shield was one of the instruments in an extremely dangerous bundle of us military projects involving the one sided development of a global anti missile system
6334941 cooperation with nato is crucial and russia will behave in a pragmatic manner following the alliances decision to freeze regular contact with moscow russias envoy to nato told
6334942 under us pressure nato agreed on tuesday to freeze contacts with russia until moscow had withdrawn its troops from georgia in line with a peace deal
6334943 we will carefully analyse this situation there wont be any aggressive action from anyone on our side we will behave in a pragmatic manner there will definitely not be a cold war dmitry rogozin said in a telephone interview
6334944 in recent days secretary of state condoleezza rice and president bush have been promising to isolate russia some american politicians have threatened to expel it from the group of 8 industrialised nations to abolish the nato russia council and to keep russia out of the world trade organisation
6334945 these are empty threats for some time now russians have been wondering if our opinion counts for nothing in those institutions do we really need them just to sit at the nicely set dinner table and listen to lectures
6334946 indeed russia has long been told to simply accept the facts
6334947 there is much talk now in the united states about rethinking relations with russia one thing that should definitely be rethought the habit of talking to russia in a condescending way without regard for its positions and interests
6334948 anti russian fervour threatens to hit fever pitch in washington this week
6334949 let no one be deceived putin has drawn a dangerous new line
6334950 theres really only one lever left invite russia to join nato
6334951 this is not a new idea once upon a time it was openly entertained in diplomatic circles east and west in late 1991 the final days of the ussr boris yeltsin stunned a nato meeting by sending a letter with this unilateral declaration today we are raising a question of russias membership in nato a long term political aim yeltsin called it then as he threw down the gauntlet before the west nato ministers as tom friedman reported for the new york times at the time were too taken aback to give any coherent response in the ensuing years as yeltsin with characteristic bravura continued to raise the prospect the west kept fumbling for a reply
6334952 there was no big problem on the world stage that we could effectively address
6334953 no said the clinton foreign policy team were going to cram nato expansion down the russians throats because moscow is weak and by the way theyll get used to it

6334980 i think overall we expected more from the game but there are some positives and some negatives and we will sit down and analyse them
6334981 maybe we should have won the game with the team we had there tonight
6334982 now there are two weeks to go to reassess the game before the qualifying game against andorra
6334983 hopefully we can build on that and take the positives but things under capello will take time to get right
6334984 the crowd were frustrated and the players fully understand that and we know we have to put on a better show
6334985 you just go to the state fair as if its the grand prize because you dont just compete with the people in your county youre competing against the whole state of maryland its really enjoyable
6334986 i think the fair now teaches kids about agriculture because they dont know as much about farming as they did when i was growing up
6334987 its local producers involved with maryland food and its pretty neat kind of a unique place
6334988 the university of maryland is bringing cattle in which is something they havent done in many years theyre doing a promotion for their dairy and other things that they have going on
6334989 theres the birthing center and the petting zoo so kids can see these animals and its just a learning experience for them
6334990 ive been coming to the fair since i was born
6334991 its kind of the end of the summer to me i enjoy seeing the people and what theyve done throughout the year
6334992 oluline on nii ettev tja ja tarbija kui ka ettev tjate omavaheline koost
6334993 im happy with the draw because the reaction of the team to the last minute was important and good
6334994 i think also in the first half we played good football with style we created a lot of chances to score goals and the team played together better with different style
6334995 only one thing i didnt like in the first half sometimes when the czechs countered we suffered this is a problem and we have to do something about
6334996 in the second half we lost the style and position and the czechs are a very good team
6334997 i asked to play against them for this reason they are not easy to beat
6334998 when a team plays the counter attack it is not easy to score a goal
6334999 i think this night we took another step im happy i saw things i have doubts about
6335000 if youre not doing r amp b youre not black enough
6335001 but im hopeful the world is changing but theres still so few black women who made a big enough impact in rock were still overlooked and still fighting for a place
6335002 rock is just rocking whatever country blues r amp b at high voltage but i missed that southern rock sound you know that old lynyrd skynyrd sound
6335003 having complete and 100 percent control over something is the thing
6335004 i didnt allow somebody to lead me down a path i took more chances i made the album i wanted to hear
6335005 being on the road with the last album so much i learned a lot about what i wanted to do on my next record
6335006 i was opening for people like robert cray etta james you cant help but absorb something
6335007 everybody is a rare child it says i can be anything i wanna be im free
6335008 i thought that was part of the history the murders which took place in this city it needs to be told it needs to be seen it makes things more real

6335013 our goal is to have an experienced lasik surgeon within 100 miles of any spinal cord injury patient in the u s to provide this service

6335017 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6335018 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6335019 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6335020 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6335021 why is it beyond the wit of our country to be able to provide the resources and encouragement in supporting australians who are unemployed to go to areas where they can get seasonal work
6335022 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6335023 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour

6335054 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors
6335055 the bca believes the government is moving in the right direction in responding to climate change but an emissions reduction scheme must recognise business reality if it is to encourage the investment required to reduce emissions and maintain a healthy economy
6335056 if we design a scheme that makes businesses unviable the end result will be relocation of vital export earning industries to other countries this will cost australian jobs without any reduction in global emissions
6335057 we have to be very conscious that any decision to shield one sector or increase the protection to one sector will inevitably place greater costs on other parts of the community and other parts of the economy

6335126 you cant say it any other way hes something youve never seen before
6335127 when you lose big games like that youre angry at yourself because when you wear the u s jersey a lot is expected youre supposed to win gold medals to miss out on even an opportunity to do that was very disappointing
6335128 its what fuels us i know not all of this team was there but everybody else watched it on tv weve already watched film on that game and i think were a much better team now sometimes losses turn out to be the biggest wins because you can learn more and they can motivate you
6335129 you can see that people are all about winning its never been about the stat sheet or whos got what
6335130 and i told them in our very first meeting that after winning three gold medals i cant remember who led what in any statistics
6335131 were in the process and if i say anything more than that i guarantee you theres
6335132 i dont know how low you people are going to go to suggest that barack obama would be in
6335133 believes it is proper to kill a baby that has survived an abortion
6335134 you must always wish for others before yourself never yourself first and always say thank you because your wish will come true
6335135 walk through the deep and lively woods make sure all is in order the trees are green and strong the rabbits are fed and happy the birds are singing songs for the day
6335136 then you must go to the well please fetch my water for the day and make your wishes and remember you must always wish for others before yourself never yourself first and always say thank you because your wish will come true
6335137 i wish for the old woman to be healthy again
6335138 you have wished for another and you have wished for me to be healed
6335139 because you have healed an old woman out of the kindness of your own dear heart i have a gift for you
6335140 the old woman of the forest led julianna down a path to a small stream
6335141 this stream is what feeds the well the well is what feeds us do you know what feeds the stream julianna
6335142 the rain from the sky fills it and the ground holds it so that we may drink
6335143 take this stone with you it is a wishing stone when you find you are lost or in need think of this stream and make a wish and remember to say thank you because your wish will come true
6335144 i was caught in patch of thorns but i tore myself free
6335145 my name is mathilda but im known as the old woman of the forest to most that pass here
6335146 in this box i do expect to see by the suns early dawn a fairy winking at me she should be sweet she should be fair and more than not she should fly through the air i wish i may as i wish i might turn this mix into a fairy tonight
6335147 please please lift this cover oh is there anyone there
6335148 all i know is im here and thank you so much for opening that cover
6335149 just so you know as a fairy there are certain things that i must do
6335150 first i must be able to fly out of the house at night when the moon rises so a window must be open at all times just a crack mind you also ill need the company of other fairies because a fairy dancing by herself in the moonlight just isnt as fun as dancing with three or four others
6335151 i must be put to good use a fairy with idle hands is quite restless and can get mischievous the most interesting work for a fairy to do is to almost be seen by someone making their way thru the woods please do ask me to do such things so that i may love to work
6335152 heres your tea little fairy and i do have a job for you after you finish your tea please find me some lady bugs for my garden they keep the aphids away you know
6335153 i brought you the lady bugs just as you asked old woman of the forest arent they just perfect
6335154 if you wanted me to come to your garden fairy you could have just asked here i was minding my own business and you come flying along and grab me by my leg i was in the middle of something you know honestly fairies can be so inconsiderate
6335155 i had no idea my request for ladybugs would have caused such a disruption i have some aphids in my garden and i had asked the fairy to bring me some ladybugs such as you to help rid my garden of them
6335156 where are they i mean wheres your garden can we go there now
6335157 if you had said aphids we would have come gladly
6335158 if terria wins the bid the very first thing i will do is contact telstra chairman donald mcgauchie or telstra ceo sol trujillo and offer them an equity shareholding in our company
6335159 the only reason i would do that is because we want the network to service the whole of the industry on equal terms and i think telstra investing as an equity owner would give the assurance that the network was being operated fairly
6335160 under our bid the major equity owner would be the commonwealth government we will then fund the build with a mix of equity investment and debt after that it will just be a matter of working out what the most efficient capital structure is
6335161 terria would give telstra as big a share as they wanted so long as they wont be able to control the consortium
6335162 telstra would be like any other equity owner in the consortium who has an interest in making sure the network was properly run but not able to influence the outcomes in their favour or to a disadvantage to the other equity holders
6335163 if the business case of this 8 shelf company terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board
6335164 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6335165 telstra invests in networks like next g and next ip while terria invests in airport billboards telstra has made absolutely clear that if it builds the nbn it will provide open and equivalent access to everyone
6335166 the nbn project marks the biggest infrastructure investment in the countrys history it has enormous potential to benefit the nation if it enhances competition but if it shuts down competition which it could to do then it has enormous potential to be a disaster
6335167 we believe particularly because there is so much taxpayer money in this project that the first areas to be serviced should be those that are currently underserviced
6335168 they were working me in so i didnt take it too seriously until coach john harbaugh called me three days ago and told me they were moving me then i saw no 46 so i took it real serious after that
6335169 a lot more offense as far as the shifts motions where to line up at the pass routes and stuff like that
6335170 so its a lot different from the defensive playbook but im in the offensive playbook trying to get it down the best that i can its a day by day process
6335171 hes a rangy athlete that can run and from the blocking perspective we suspect he can do it because he comes off the ball so well on defense he uses his hat and hands and can push a tight end around so maybe well flip that around and see how it goes
6335172 hes expected to play in the opener but until we see him out there doing it i dont think we know for sure
6335173 he needs reps with the starters he needs them against a defense in a third preseason game where theyre game planning him a little bit well see how he does
6335174 i say that because i am confident in what i can do and what i will do
6335175 im very very thankful for the situation and opportunity and grateful for everything thats to come
6335176 the thinking is kyle has had 42 starts and we have a good idea of what he is and what hes been
6335177 right now i would suspect that troy is going to get every opportunity to play a lot
6335178 but if were getting a feel for something and we want to try something else we always have the option to do that in a preseason game but our plan is for troy to play with the starters and we might bring joe in at the end
6335179 obviously you put a little more weight on certain guys over other guys who have been around the door is open if they have a thought or insight wed love to hear it
6335180 were glad to have students from so many great schools participate in this inaugural poll

6335198 thank you sir what is it exactly why is it so great
6335199 just take it to fertile soil and make a wish be good to your parents and sleep a good nights sleep in the morning you will find this small red bean will have made your wish come true
6335200 well just make sure you plant it far enough from the house in case it falls over
6335201 i wish for the greatest tree to climb that there ever was i wish it to be the tallest tree there ever was and i wish for it to be so strong that it will never fall over
6335202 you can say its going to click on this date but its going to click when its going to click
6335203 i dont think i really had any expectation about it
6335204 i hate to say it is what it is because thats an old cliche but it kind of is
6335205 guys are going to be learning the offense for years to come in reality
6335206 from a teaching perspective thats the way youve got to look at it well game plan the stuff they know the best and run the stuff we master the most but theyre not going to be with this offense the way we want them for a while yet
6335207 im tired and i dont expect ill get my cart much farther down this rock ridden road by myself
6335208 i mean excuse me sir i can help you if you like i can walk with you to the city walls and pick up whatever falls off
6335209 i just might take you up on it child but first sit down with me for moment so that i may rest my weary bones
6335210 how old do you think i am i havent always been so old i was once young like you
6335211 no im much older much much older than 100 years old ive been around for a very long time but ive never forgotten that i was once very young
6335212 my name is giovanni and i used to be a performer
6335213 i used to swing on a trapeze and fly through the air why i could flip from one trapeze to another it kept me quite strong you know i could easily carry this cart into town to sell my apples without a second thought
6335214 ive never really ever been away from my house my father works in the city every day from sun up to sun down my mother is always gathering firewood and carrying it on her back for the others that live down the road
6335215 time is a funny thing nero right now youve got a lot of it im not sure what you do to keep yourself busy there in your home i imagine that soon youll be carrying firewood just like your mother not long after i suspect you may work in the city from sun up to sun down before all of that take this book look at these pictures they old but theyre drawn very well try to do what they do in these pages it tells you how to do handstands and flips it tells you how to become strong much stronger than youll ever get carrying fire wood take this book ill come by here every now and again to see how youre doing now if youll help me push this cart to the city
6335216 youve really been practicing you know theres a circus inside the city you have become quite good just from looking at the book you could become even better with the instruction of a proper instructor you never know they just might let you in and a life of performance can lead you to a life full of joy and comfort youll be stronger livelier and healthier than you would be otherwise come to the center of the city where the circus theater is tomorrow i will meet you there
6335217 my son nero has been learning the tricks of the circus hes become quite good we would like to see if he may get better by studying here
6335218 giovanni you have perfect timing i know you said we werent taking anymore students but have you just seen this boy fly about as good as a monkey he is truly very good surely we should consider taking him as a student
6335219 trading since the end of june has been solid nevertheless the group is mindful of the likelihood that trading in some of its markets may become still more challenging over the coming months
6335220 to realign its cost base in those markets where medium term demand is expected to remain subdued whilst also keeping market developments under close watch to promptly implement additional pre prepared contingency measures should these become appropriate

6335228 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6335229 some of the reports weve had out today have been slightly negative despite some coming out with higher profit theyre indicating forward earnings are coming under pressure
6335230 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6335231 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6335232 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6335233 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6335234 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6335235 why is it beyond the wit of our country to be able to provide the resources and encouragement in supporting australians who are unemployed to go to areas where they can get seasonal work
6335236 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6335237 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6335238 weve been able to resolve all of the outstanding issues between us
6335239 this allows us to go forward and build the much needed public housing
6335240 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6335241 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6335242 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important

6335247 at first i was concerned that he would miss summer workouts
6335248 i thought that he was one of our leaders on and off the field i thought that he needed to be there but after talking to him ive changed my opinion i definitely thought this was a positive experience for him
6335249 the basic training and football training were pretty much the same the difference is that physical training is all day and all night it was very hard mentally and that was the part that was a bit harder than football

6335265 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses
6335266 if you desire the spirit of god you must be in the body of christ
6335267 this is more powerful than the discoth que it is really beautiful here because i can do something for others
6335268 always be prepared to make a defense to any one who calls you to account for the hope that is in you
6335269 follow me carry the cross with me and walk in my footsteps
6335270 in the cross and through the cross we are saved
6335271 it is easy for you to say so because you are healthy but i am suffering my passion
6335272 holy father how can we live the gifts of the holy spirit in practice here in our country and in our daily lives in such a way that our relatives friends and acquaintances feel and experience his power and how can we exercise our mission as christs witnesses
6335273 that faith today is a force that is present a force that can give people the right orientation this is why there was a moment in which we truly felt the breath of the holy spirit who sweeps away prejudices who makes people understand that yes here we find what closely affects us this is the direction in which we must go and in this way we can live in this way the future unfolds
6335274 it is far more difficult in practice to perceive the action of the holy spirit
6335275 in the end it is the lord who helps us but we must be available as instruments
6335276 i would say simply no one can give what he does not personally possess in other words we cannot pass on the holy spirit effectively or make him perceptible to others unless we ourselves are close to him
6335277 within the radius of the holy spirits breath in contact with him only if we are continually touched within by the holy spirit if he dwells in us will it be possible for us to pass him on to others
6335278 we in a certain sense must ask christ to breathe on us always so that his breath will become alive and strong and work upon the world this means that we must keep close to christ
6335279 as if we were to find ourselves strolling in the garden of the holy spirit we talk to him and he talks to us
6335280 and then naturally this listening walking in the environment of the word must be transformed into a response a response in prayer in contact with christ
6335281 god has access to us all the time we are in continuous contact with christ and we are continuously receiving the breath of the holy spirit
6335282 if we do this if we are not too lazy undisciplined or sluggish then something happens to us the day acquires a form and in it our life itself acquires a form and this light will shine from us without us having to give it much thought
6335283 human virtues show that faith is truly present that we are truly with christ and i believe that we should pay great attention to this also regarding ourselves to develop an authentic humanity in ourselves because faith involves the complete fulfillment of the human being of humanity
6335284 we should pay attention to carrying out human tasks well and correctly also in our profession in respect for our neighbor in being concerned about our neighbor which is the best way to be concerned about ourselves
6335285 in act existing for our neighbor is the best way of existing for ourselves
6335286 in recent decades the doctrine of creation had almost disappeared from theology it was almost imperceptible
6335287 we are now aware of the damage that this has caused if we do not proclaim god in his full grandeur as creator and as redeemer we also diminish the value of the redemption
6335288 it is he the creator himself who did and can enter into history and operate in it precisely because he is the god of the whole and not only of a part if we recognize this it will obviously follow that the redemption being christian and simply christian faith also means responsibility always and everywhere with regard to creation
6335289 as long as the earth was seen as gods creation the task of subduing it was never intended as an order to enslave it but rather as the task of being guardians of creation and developing its gifts of actively collaborating in gods work ourselves in the evolution that he ordered in the world so that the gifts of creation might be appreciated rather than trampled upon and destroyed
6335290 the brutal consumption of creation begins where god is not where matter is henceforth only material for us where we ourselves are the ultimate demand where the whole is merely our property and we consume it for ourselves alone
6335291 and the wasting of creation begins when we no longer recognize any need superior to our own but see only ourselves
6335292 i think therefore that true and effective initiatives to prevent the waste and destruction of creation can be implemented and developed understood and lived only where creation is considered as beginning with god

6335323 this gives jamaicans a new picture to hold in their hands and look at for a moment and say to themselves you know we can do better
6335324 the whole country feels right now as if good things are happening to us for a change
6335325 they did this because they dont want us to come back
6335326 i stayed to defend our house they destroyed everything they burned our house and killed and stole our cattle

6335328 i am going to mark it for settlement of the balance i am going to mark it final
6335329 put your big girl panties on and deal with it
6335330 i think given the spirit of the mou memorandum of understanding which up front stated that within the spirit of the agreement no party was going to convene parliament or formulate a cabinet before an agreement is signed moving to swear in parliament is in part a breach of the memorandum of understanding however we need to make a qualification there that the contestation in the talks right now is not about the swearing in of parliament is in dispute but i think the most critical point which zanu pf and president robert mugabe moves beyond that he would be crossing the rules is assembling the cabinet
6335331 assembling cabinet will actually be vesting authority in institutions and i think that will amount to be in total breach of the negotiating process and by extension it will undermine the talks
6335332 the opposition has no problem in the opening of parliament insofar as the swearing in of parliament comes in from the results of the march 29 elections which by and large the mdc has actually stated that it reflects the will of the people what the bone of contention is based on the march 29 elections which leads to the swearing in of parliament the assembly of cabinet put mugabe in a position where he uses the june 27 results that he would use for vesting himself as the president to assemble a cabinet and that is where the dispute is and that is where it will undermine the talks and the spirit of the mou
6335333 when you read the mou it states that before the agreement is signed parliament and cabinet should not be sworn in and the cabinet should not be assembled but i think the mou was based not only on an understanding but also on an assumption by the facilitator that by then they would have rapped up the deal and there would have been a concrete deal on the table and all the parties would have signed up to it so i think this issues have been long drawn and it is a long haul and there is no signature appended to this process by all the parties it actually brings into question the issue of a breach of the memorandum of understanding which says parliament and cabinet shouldnt have been assembled
6335334 i think the move is meaningless for the simple reason that what he can only get from there is that is how the issues of the speaker of our parliament is going to be nominated i think that is where the only leverage is but the battleground is the cabinet
6335335 the edinburgh military tattoo is one of the summer highlights a spectacular show that sees edinburgh castle transformed into a dazzling stage set thats why im delighted that next year it will be widening access and enabling more scots across the country to be a part of the experience

6335359 the us is teaching that apples are really oranges liberal means close minded first off i am an artist and a single parent i find many in the creative fields are liberals that talk about wanting diversity yet live in their white community near by a multi cultural neighbor and send their kids to private schools they dont even socialize with poor ethnic people but they support crossing our borders illegally they may eat their food and have an impressive amount of foreign stamps in their passport but living in a diversified community is an oxymoron it is all frustrating that so many americans want to give away the freedom and rights of country to the masses that have little respect for this country they may live here illegally and wanted to be here but the disrespect is common and so is the american that is not sticking to values that this country was founded
6335360 knife fight in mt angel oregon five sent to hospital mexican gang involved hardly any coverage in the media
6335361 lets just say that i was myself very tolerant just a couple of years or so back but by now my patience is wearing thin to say at least today i wish i had never even heard about islam or muslims in fact im so sick and tired of these a holes that are using the system against us thus making whole nations to rot from within gladly supported by pc politicians and media we the peoples of europe are now second rate citizens in our own countries never let them grow as strong in your country as they have here if that happens they will rob you all blind by suing the crap out of you as we all now they can make a lot more money on suing in the states than here in europe and they will do it if they get the chance i wouldnt be too surprised if you will have to save us from ourselves yet another time quite frankly i dont think you have much choice if they take over certain countries then they will suddenly have a lot of nukes and france and uk are among the countries most infested with these lunatics

6335379 it will be over 10 years since ive stepped foot back in canberra
6335380 the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us
6335381 its important that we get together now to prepare for what will possibly be our toughest qualifier for the world cup because we go into the unknown against uzbekistan
6335382 we have been caught by surprise as to how quickly our situation has become public it is with regret that i confirm todays media reports are correct and that liz and i have decided to separate
6335383 given the personal nature of the matter i ask that you please respect our privacy as we attempt to deal with this sensitive situation
6335384 we have an incredibly successful era under stuart and there is a little bit of a similarity there
6335385 i think we are hopefully making the right steps to get back to where we were when he was coaching
6335386 i think freddie has taken stuarts coaching on board and freddie has got his own style as well
6335387 it is a bit of a contrast in styles there but certainly both of them have got the same principles and the same work ethic as well so theres a lot of similarities there
6335388 every time you play a team coached by ricky stuart you know you are in for a tough game and certainly thats the way they play their football
6335389 i dont think theyve had a game where they havent turned up to play this year and thats the way the teams he coaches prepare and thats the way youve got to prepare if you want to be able to hold them
6335390 all of us want to cement a top four spot with a three point buffer ahead of brisbane
6335391 its important in that respect but we certainly feel it is two different competitions
6335392 we have an understanding that he bennett has a job to do and i have a job to do and personal feelings about each other dont come into it
6335393 once wayne signed with st george he always had to plan for st george
6335394 id hate to think though that his main focus wasnt on making sure that the side was playing well and in good form
6335395 this year is still our main focus and weve both still got a job to do
6335396 we wouldnt be doing the right thing by the players if that wasnt the case
6335397 wayne bennett obviously has things he has to plan with st george and were doing the same for the brisbane broncos
6335398 its a difficult situation but darius has made his decision we know about it now and we have to move on
6335399 if anyone wants to doubt israels signing here they just need to go and look at a few of his games and what he can do
6335400 hes young and hes a wonderful player and hes got a long long career ahead of him
6335401 we needed that area of our game fixed up and he can certainly fill the void for us
6335402 we have lost some good players but weve also signed some good players and we think weve got a couple of good young players in our under 20s who can come through next year which well find out in the next few months
6335403 we all know what were capable of its just a matter of whether we want to play that way
6335404 weve made a few excuses for ourselves because weve been missing players but at the end of the day we didnt have the right attitude last week
6335405 weve got all our players back now so there cant be any excuses this week
6335406 we all knew after the game on friday night against the dragons that our attitude wasnt there
6335407 time will tell whether everyones changed their attitude but theres been a bit of soul searching this week
6335408 we need to win our remaining three games and win them with some sore of authority
6335409 the big arm guard he only has to notice that and his confidence is going to be a little bit rocked
6335410 any halfback who is a main ball player is going to get tested and were no different
6335411 our big wide running forwards head for those guys and our plays revolve around engaging those players hell get tested
6335412 every time i play theres always forwards out to get me
6335413 i think i overcame a lot of demons last week taking the field
6335414 im little more confident that i can get through the full 80 and i wouldnt be playing if i didnt think that
6335415 im sure the broncos will be targeting me a little in defence but thats to be expected
6335416 hes got a varied kicking game which weve talked about and weve got a plan to handle that
6335417 theres certain players that we need to be aware that are around the area hes going to kick to so i think weve got that covered

6335426 our previous work produced important data but it involved short term acute interventions
6335427 this study will be the first long term investigation into whether nutritional supplements and aerobic exercise benefit normal but sedentary older people
6335428 obviously were keeping an open mind that it may or may not work we hope that it does work though because these would both be safe and widely applicable interventions that could help us in keeping older people healthy fit and independent

6335434 theyre huge size 19 already and his wingspan is 7 1
6335435 hes very explosive for his size for me thats the correlation to his fathers game
6335436 i dont think it really kicked in for shawn jr that he had a famous father
6335437 that was the first time i remember seeing him since i was 3 years old
6335438 we got to talk to him after the game before he got on the bus for like 15 minutes
6335439 i got a message saying im your brother and i was like oh ok
6335440 and i feel its better late than never that hes going to try to be part of things
6335441 ive been wanting to wear 40 for a while now

6335444 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
6335445 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6335446 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer
6335447 do i think homeless people are bad no but theyre here because its easy and because we werent enforcing public order crimes weve received a mandate from the citizens to clean up the city and take back the neighborhoods so here we go
6335448 the ones that were usually out here giving us problems are in jail right now
6335449 i cant rest i understand some of it i dont like people begging me if youre not bothering nobody why do you have to move where do you want me to go
6335450 honestly i dont see how this has much to do with your election
6335451 the bottom line is they had sold these coffins to people and they were imitations of an american made casket and so they got a restraining order to stop doing that
6335452 should have been aware of this going on and here hes actively marketing foreign products undermining american made products
6335453 the product the chinese are offering us now its a quality product
6335454 you put a chinese casket next to a york casket or one of these other manufacturers you cant tell the difference

6335494 when he was in power he did not do anything when he is not in power now he makes 1 001 promises to the people this is just playing politics

6335498 oh im not pregnant i just had a lot of carbs for breakfast its just what do they call it a breakfast pouch
6335499 this is a tripartite negotiating framework you cannot get an agreement where only two parties agree
6335500 the political impasse will only be broken when we have an agreement that reflects the will of the people as expressed in the march election
6335501 we are indeed convinced that it is possible to conclude these negotiations quite quickly
6335502 if you can keep your head when all about you
6335503 we have seen zanu pfs strategy of divide and rule in the past and this time it will not work not this time
6335504 if what president mbeki said to reporters after the talks in harare is anything to go by then we have a big problem within the party because there is no way we could be associated with a decision that favours mugabe
6335505 the position on the talks that we had as a party is similar to that of the morgan tsvangirai formation and if what mbeki says is correct then arthur mutambara will have to explain to the national council why he acted in the manner alleged
6335506 people are angry at that decision and they are shocked with mutambaras position because the people of this region matabeleland have said they do not want mugabe as a leader
6335507 the move by mutambara to support mugabes bid to remain in power is shocking to people from matabeleland
6335508 the decision by mutambara to back mugabe is disgusting and the people of matabeleland which mutambara claim to represent through the 10 parliamentary seats won in the region have always said since 1980 that they are tired of mugabe we therefore are prepared to cause by elections in our constituencies by leaving the party in order to defend the will of the people
6335509 working with mugabe in any form replicates the 1987 agreement which led to the submergence of one political party by another and people from matabeleland will frown on any attempt by their leaders to work with mugabe without the march 29 victors
6335510 the mdc mutambara faction is now serving the purpose they were called for in the talks which is to play a script that was written before the talks
6335511 when hitler attacked the jews i was not a jew therefore i was not concerned and when hitler attacked the catholics i was not a catholic and therefore i was not concerned and when hitler attacked the unions and the industrialists i was not a member of the unions and i was not concerned then hitler attacked me and the protestant church and there was nobody left to be concerned
6335512 what am i shall i say a rational animal no for then i would have to inquire what an animal is and what rationality is
6335513 i spoke with her it was a private conversation but were exchanging numbers and weve put all our previous troubles in the past

6335522 im pretty confident in the way it feels right now
6335523 and its going to feel better by the time the first game comes its not like tomorrows game time so ive still got a little bit of time to let it heal more but i feel fine right now
6335524 were thrilled to death were real excited about his progress and he couldnt be playing better
6335525 last year setting the bench press record was step one in having a good year
6335526 this year same thing because mentally it let me know that im stronger than i was last year and i want to be better than i was last year so that was step one for this year to being better
6335527 stay strong stay positive dont get down i have my teammates here that was a tremendous support system for me keeping me motivated and positive through all this i knew that id been through cancer a broken legll heal with time it was far from the worst thing ive ever been through
6335528 laron is solid and so is brent so well just get both of those guys ready to go
6335529 i would feel comfortable with either one of those two guys i wouldnt panic with either one of those guys out there
6335530 thats not a problem going that late theyve been working with safety darcel mcbath and the first unit or the second unit for a while the calls are still the same were not going to miss anything in continuity with the first group of guys
6335531 when we were giving them the same number of reps hed outperform graham about a third of the time
6335532 ive gotten better at some things and theres a lot of things i need to get better at overall i think ive had an average camp i need to have a great one
6335533 i dont know if hes quite as accurate as graham hes got a stronger arm but i dont know if hes quite as accurate he may well be next year at this time theres a little better people around graham but i think taylors done really well
6335534 i became interested in the ways people cheat when our hospital started drug testing
6335535 i went home and called some 800 numbers i found online and found i could buy anything i wanted to falsify a test as long as i gave them my credit card number
6335536 some people think if you spend all this money and some of these products cost a lot they will work
6335537 employees know they will be tested employers tell them their places are drug free
6335538 medical defense and airline industries have been testing aggressively for years
6335539 but now its common in other industries too including construction utilities and education thanks to increased awareness of substance abuse employers not only screen employees but also do random testing after people are hired
6335540 the craziest one ive seen so far is a guy who used a catheter to put urine from a drug free friend into his own bladder before taking a urine test

6335543 without doubt there is frustration with the way the issue has been managed and the length of time it has taken to be resolved with the icc
6335544 there is certainly no frustration with new zealand cricket our guys understand the predicament new zealand cricket are in
6335545 they have signed up for contracts they have obligations and they need to work through this issue with other members of the icc board as best as they can and i know they are trying to do that

6335548 we have a pretty hard hitting message about dino rossi about what hes done in the past what his record is and what we think that translates into in terms of policy on issues that people care about
6335549 the conservatives have been very aggressive in using every medium available to them to get their message out the progressive community sees how effective they can be in doing that and feel that our voice needs to be heard as well
6335550 the contributions that evergreen progress has received thus far are contributions that were earned through someones sweat and effort
6335551 the construction workers the nurses the teachers the home health care workers the people who have contributed to this work really hard for their money and those are the contributions that we have received
6335552 i dont think their voice is any less important to hear in this election than the voice of big developers rich individuals big business or other people who are contributing to dino rossi
6335553 at the same time as she is sitting and negotiating with these folks she is accepting campaign contributions and they are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on her behalf
6335554 its pretty convenient for dino rossi to say i dont think nurses should have a voice in this election or i dont think construction workers should have a voice hes saying that because he doesnt agree with what they have to say
6335555 we support rossi because he is aligned with us philosophically he is pro small business
6335556 its different when seiu and wfse are cutting checks for hundreds of thousands of dollars and they are sitting down and negotiating pay raises for their members
6335557 i dont deal with the campaign so i dont know what they are doing im just trying to negotiate a contract i dont know what they are contributing to the campaign
6335558 i am just trying to negotiate a contract that is fair to both sides
6335559 they have a lot to lose if gregoire is not re elected we fully expected them to bring out the big guns and spend every penny they can
6335560 i dont think that is a tactic that we invented thats a common role that independent groups play
6335561 we point out the record and critique it and the candidate is free to focus on selling themselves to voters and explaining why they should be elected
6335562 its an unfortunate consequence of the changes the legislature made to the civil service laws in 2002
6335563 it sets up a built in appearance of conflict of interest every four years during the gubernatorial races just one of many reasons why the legislature should reassert its control over state employment contracts and bring them back into the public light of day through the legislative process
6335564 we have supported chris gregoire for re election and the political process that we are always in but the bargaining process is separate and there is absolutely no quid pro quo
6335565 this governor is a very tough negotiator she listens but she is a very tough negotiator and we dont expect that by supporting this governor that the contract will reflect that support
6335566 i blew my mind and i blew the worlds mind
6335567 guys that tall should not be able to start like that he used every ounce of energy he wanted that record
6335568 ive been saying all season that the 200 means a lot more to me than the 100 meters
6335569 this world record means a lot to me because ive been dreaming of this since i was yea high i know it means a lot to my country also i talked to the prime minister and he told me everything in jamaica is blocked off because everybody is in the streets he told me ive written history and im proud of that
6335570 its something you cant explain and he has it im just proud to be part of the race hopefully 50 years from now my grandkids will actually make fun of me saying oh you got beat by usain bolt for him to break that record is just crazy that was the best world record out there still standing it definitely means hes the best sprinter ever im just happy to be part of history
6335571 when you see someone of that size run that quickly doing something physiologically that weve never seen before then we are going to get incredible times
6335572 he has incredible leg speed and a long stride that combination is deadly
6335573 its mathematics every step hes that much farther ahead you can do stride for stride but if hes landing farther hes going to continue to get farther and farther in front
6335574 you wont see another one like that for another 50 years
6335575 i dont want to say anything too serious because my coach may just want me to run the 400 meters
6335576 anything is possible if i put my mind to it like i did this season to work really hard to come out here and do my best
6335577 a lot of people are hoping ill go to the 400 personally im telling you guys dont hold your breath i dont think ill be going to the 400 meters any time soon
6335578 a coach would normally threaten him that if he dont run fast in the 100 you will run in the 400
6335579 so he makes sure he runs fast in the 100
6335580 he promised six years from now he will run the 400 when he gets tired of running the 100 and the 200 hell move up
6335581 i got up at 12 and my masseuse brought me nuggets because i didnt want to go to the cafeteria
6335582 i came to the track and my masseuse brought me more nuggets i just had two because my coach was saying i shouldnt have too much nuggets
6335583 one of his greatest assets is not to take anything too seriously
6335584 if this guy worked his tail off every day on his knees throwing up like i was in practice then he deserves to dance
6335585 if he feels good about the times hes doing dance you dance and you laugh and you have a good time when you know youve put in the work if he put in the work let him celebrate if you think its disrespectful work harder so you can be the one dancing it dont bother me i love it
6335586 i just wanted to kind of be rid of it
6335587 so this was the choice i made and it was a tough one
6335588 after looking at all the treatment plans the one that was going to work for me was to have a bilateral mastectomy
6335589 i didnt want to go back to the doctors every four months for testing
6335590 absolutely 100 percent clear and clean it did not spread they got everything out so im definitely not going to die from breast cancer
6335591 she is dealing with a lot right now but it is a discussion that needs to take place
6335592 the difference here is that she has cancer she is not simply at risk for cancer
6335593 she needs to deal with what she is dealing with right now which is the breast cancer

6335605 most sunday mornings at buckhead church in downtown atlanta one person is conspicuously absent the senior pastor
6335606 as the wall street journal noted earlier this summer american megachurch pastors are starting up video based branches overseas to spread their faith and their faces to places where evangelical christianity is just taking hold using starbucks as their model for rapid expansion
6335607 but here at home where houses of worship are already as plentiful as suburban strip centers the same strategy of high tech franchising is emerging despite objections from many christians that its the wrong way to reach new converts
6335608 radosh is so impressed by some christian rock christian literature and the christian desire to participate as equals in american pop culture that he wants to see this segment of the subculture adopted by the larger one
6335609 the greatest lesson in the book is not in what radosh says with words but what he teaches by way of his tremendous example if christians treated american pop culture with the same respectful criticism and discerning openness that radosh employed when examining the evangelical universe neither rejecting nor accepting everything these two cultures could have a productive encounter krystal lewis and kelly clarkson could teach each other some new rhythms dan rupple and david letterman could slip each other some new jokes dan brown and jerry b jenkins could swap some writing tips
6335610 aside from ireland every instance of christianity spreading and absorbing a culture in europe after the fall of rome was initiated from the top and down
6335611 many protestants even contend that christianization of the european peasantry was not completed until after the reformation but there were strong incentives to become a pious christian in europe after 1000 when christianity and civilization and elite status went hand in hand and paganism was tantamount to barbarism
6335612 those were old quotes he doesnt feel that way anymore i just talked with david the other day over breakfast at the beverly hills hotel and explained to him in great detail what we had planned for the show and he said he liked it and gave his approval
6335613 i came in and wanted to revamp i went back and watched the original series the first season and asked whats the mythology where are we going and how do we create this 25 years later its been all about taking the concept to the next level
6335614 despite macroeconomic uncertainties we expect higher commodity prices to hold we anticipate a very strong performance from the group in the second half of 2008
6335615 although we achieved a good control of costs in the first half we expect cost pressures to prevail through the second half of 2008 and into 2009
6335616 but by an infinite expectation of the dawn which does not forsake us in our soundest sleep
6335617 in proportion to the number of things which he can afford to let alone
6335618 i have only a finite number of words in me
6335619 i cant remember the last time i used a notebook
6335620 this feels more like a blog post rosie a good blog but a lame article
6335621 il nome e il cognome non sono elementi sufficienti per attribuire la nazionalit

6335623 sokolov wells saw the englishman outplay his formidable opponent but agree a draw in a position where he stood substantially better but had little time on the clock
6335624 peter wells gained a dangerous looking attack against smeets king but used a huge amount of time on the clock a massive time scramble saw peter finally lose the thread at move 34 and when his flag fell three moves later he was already losing on the board as well
6335625 peter wells played the sharpest game of the day against cherniaev and should certainly have won against the latters extremely optimistic play however the clock was again peters great enemy and he repeated moves in a position where he was objectively winning
6335626 feck me alexander now im going to end up on some blog with an eejit 1000 elo points my inferior telling me how i should play chess
6335627 white maintained the initiative but went astray around move 25 and when he offered the draw a couple of moves later it was doubtful whether he really had enough for his two pawn deficit however peters clock was doing its usual nasty things to him
6335628 we are checking whether mortars were fired by terrorists or pakistani soldiers
6335629 i decided to find a better way to react to frivolous lawsuits than just being reactive
6335630 if you think of the litigation cycle as a sandwich
6335631 then were the two pieces of bread and the medical malpractice attorney is the meat in the middle before a case ever gets started you first try to prevent it and then set up an infrastructure to enable viable countersuits down the road
6335632 theres no basis for suing someone for suing you if they have a legitimate complaint
6335633 if an attorney brings a suit without basis he can be sanctioned by the courts but that rarely happens
6335634 but now the fish have uzis were arming the fish
6335635 then north carolina is a pretty good place to be
6335636 medical justice is just another option for physicians trying to navigate a rough malpractice environment
6335637 its hard to tell from their website what they can do and cant do
6335638 in north carolina they cant do a countersuit against a plaintiff or a plaintiffs lawyer sometimes physicians after the case is over and theyve been sued will make a case against the expert but thats something thats relatively new within the last five years
6335639 rating a doctor is harder than rating a toaster or a car because patients comes in all flavors
6335640 the risk you run is getting doctors who try to game the system by choosing only patients who are healthy and easy to treat
6335641 if they figured that out they ought to patent it and can it and bottle it and sell it because it would be very valuable
6335642 profile of the chemical odours linked to skin cancer may lead to a day when diagnoses can be made by waving a scanner over the skin researchers told the annual conference of the american chemical society in philadelphia pennsylvania
6335643 researchers have speculated that tumours give off different odours but were the first to identify and quantify the compounds involved in skin cancer odours said chemist michelle gallagher who conducted the study at the monell chemical senses centre in philadelphia pennsylvania
6335644 a different profile of chemicals above tumour sites relative to healthy skin the same chemicals are present but at skin cancer sites some chemicals are increased while others are decreased compared to healthy individuals
6335645 odour profile of all three forms of skin cancer including squamous cell cancer and melanoma the deadliest form
6335646 open doors to potential new approaches to skin cancer diagnosis based on the profile of skin odours hopefully leading to more rapid and non invasive detection and diagnosis
6335647 we originally planned for the project to last for a term
6335648 it started off as a simple thing and then grew from there we never realised it would become this big
6335649 its about keeping it simple and having a common message repeated in a myriad of ways to suit the target audiences
6335650 children can pass it on to their parents and get them to change their habits
6335651 prevent governments from calling snap elections for short term political advantage
6335652 over the next few weeks whether or not we can have a productive fall session of parliament or whether in fact the government needs a new mandate
6335653 i never thought pamba would actually make it this far in the competition but we are thrilled she has
6335654 she has an incurable disease contracted from proto theca a type of algae found in puddles grass and ponds which is extremely rare and is always fatal
6335655 but not only has she lived far longer than anyone dared hope she also puts up with horrible treatment while staying happy and cheerful she really is a joy
6335656 it really is awful dogs suffer terrible diarrhoea often blindness and eventually organ failure usually followed by death within a few months of diagnosis
6335657 but pamba is a fighter she has had this disease for two and half years but she is not blind and she is very much alive she is a heroine
6335658 its not important that pamba wins she is already a winner to me
6335659 whatever concerns anyone may have had that this might become some clever way to undermine the rights protected under roe v wade have i think been addressed
6335660 unless someone attempts to disrupt this effort by dragging the abortion debate back into it i have little doubt that it will be passed without much controversy
6335661 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point prior to being born alive as defined in this section
6335662 i told the proponents that the bill simply wasnt ever going to get through as long as there was suspicion that it was a back door way to get at roe v wade or criminalize abortion in illinois
6335663 i told the proponents just give us some extra language that will establish a comfort level for the pro choice community
6335664 they said it wasnt acceptable they said the feds didnt need those kinds of words why did we need it
6335665 it wasnt necessary the bill would have passed without it pro abort legislators needed a reason to support it in the face of mounting pressure and added those 2 redundancies to save face
6335666 obama held born alive on march 6 2003 from even being voted on in committee it is also important to note from the docket that on march 13 2003 obama stopped the senate sponsor from adding the lately discussed clarification paragraph from the federal baipa to make the bills absolutely identical
6335667 obama as chairman of the committee that vetted illinois version in 2003 refused to allow an amendment rendering both concluding paragraphs identical he also refused to call the bill and killed it
6335668 illinois prosecutors and officials with the ill dept of public health are hereby enjoined from initiating any prosecution including but not limited to criminal proceedings or imposing any sanction for violation of or enforcing in any way any of certain defined the provisions of the illinois abortion law of 1975 against any physician offering or performing abortions or pregnancy terminations
6335669 given that the bottom line is that the bill has only passed when its critics are satisfied that its utterly meaningless this doesnt seem like a particularly substantive debate over whether or not he wants to kill living infants
6335670 we dont pass on the entire burden onto the consumers every time the atf prices go up so it is highly unlikely that we will reduce the airfares this month but it also depends on the quantum of atf price reduction
6335671 even if atf prices are reduced we will hold on to the current fares for a month if the prices come down next month also then we will reduce the fares
6335672 a scheme for strengthening non formal pds through state civil supplies corporations and consumers marketing federations is proposed to enable these agencies to effectively intervene in the market by increasing availability of commodities during periods of price increases
6335673 these measures are aimed at increasing domestic availability and a consequent reduction in prices through improved supply management
6335674 fiscal measures may however gradually lead to increase in fiscal deficit which in turn may create inflationary tendencies
6335675 the need for reducing high fiscal deficit which initially arose to prevent crowding out investment has become all the more important to control present inflation
6335676 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6335677 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6335678 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6335679 i was so proud of myself because now everyone has had the opportunity to say goodbye properly
6335680 i feel like i have said everything too and if i died tomorrow it would be sad but there would be no regrets
6335681 every parent thinks their son or daughter is special and we are no different adrian touched all who knew him were very proud of all his achievements in tragically such a short time
6335682 determined to get over this disease and reclaim my normal life as quickly as possible
6335683 i have a confession to make with a few exceptions i generally loathe blogs whos really interested in a pet cat someone buying new shoes or top tips on how to plant potatoes
6335684 i just hope my blogs dont fall into the unacceptable category of really bloody boring
6335685 ive been preparing for this eventuality now for the best part of 18 months ive led a decent life seen a lot of the world and been in a job ive enjoyed as for dying how can anyone be scared of something that is going to happen to every single one of us
6335686 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
6335687 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6335688 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6335689 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6335690 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6335691 during the operation more than 30 militants were killed and a large cache of mortar rounds and ied improvised explosive device materials were destroyed by the commandos
6335692 information gathered following a recent attack by militants on international security assistance forces isaf in that area
6335693 i hope this medal can be a message of peace in afghanistan
6335694 when i heard the national anthem i was truly emotional and i got goosebumps
6335695 ive been waiting for this day for a long time
6335696 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6335697 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6335698 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6335699 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6335700 why is it beyond the wit of our country to be able to provide the resources and encouragement in supporting australians who are unemployed to go to areas where they can get seasonal work
6335701 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6335702 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6335703 the only significant european bound route for caspian sea oil and gas that does not go through russia
6335704 weve been able to resolve all of the outstanding issues between us
6335705 this allows us to go forward and build the much needed public housing
6335706 its important that glitter comes back here and that hes carefully risk assessed here in the uk where we can do that
6335707 its important that we stop him traveling overseas again where he is a known risk of abusing children

6335723 various stages of negotiations with all u s based carriers
6335724 you are absolutely on point about giving passengers a reason to smile as a number are around me this afternoon
6335725 the purser on this flight just came up to tell me about the happy reactions she has been getting from passengers i get the feeling she doesnt get that too often
6335726 we support most corporate vpns virtual private networks so that passengers can utilize the service in full compliance with their business security requirements in addition we are also working with isps that serve corporations ipass is one that weve announced so that passengers who are required to gain access through that enhanced security service can also use gogo
6335727 we considered a number of different options when we looked at this technology
6335728 the reason we went with aircell is that they offer the most robust option out there the equipment is lightweight equipment so from a fuel perspective were not concerned there
6335729 we think that the satellite based connectivity for us is a more robust experience for our customers
6335730 we believe its more consistent than air to ground we want to test it to see what the customer experience is before we install it on all our aircraft
6335731 the huge issue has been the cost of putting the systems into the planes
6335732 its made it very difficult to have a reasonable expectation to earn money off the system
6335733 i think an awful lot of people will find it attractive twelve dollars for a five hour flight is nothing if it provides sufficiently fast service for people who like to surf the web and arent driven crazy by slow speeds the business traveler doesnt surf the web they want to send and receive e mails its pretty straightforward and you dont need tremendous connectivity to do that
6335734 as we do with other content we provide onboard we trust that our customers will use good judgment and that will prevail
6335735 our flight attendants are pretty well trained to deal with and handle situations where someone is displaying inappropriate content
6335736 why does this agency think its okay to keep playing russian roulette with childrens lives

6335744 it seems that the hagues are everyones favourite flight companions this summer
6335745 william hagues books on the other williams pitt and wilberforce have dominated our annual mps summer reading survey and this mirrors the sales we see in our stores hague is now one of our bestselling historians
6335746 part of my reason for going into medicine was to work overseas
6335747 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination
6335748 it can potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6335749 there is little evidence available about the effectiveness of the alexander technique so this research is welcome
6335750 the alexander technique is something we do recommend and the feedback we have got is good
6335751 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6335752 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6335753 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6335754 there is still much to be done to ensure teenagers have as good a chance of survival as any other age group and are recognised as a distinct group with particular needs
6335755 our findings may someday allow doctors to screen for and diagnose skin cancers at very early stages
6335756 you will need to be able to copy the look and style of both authors signatures
6335757 theres so much of the metal around they take advantage of it
6335758 there are recyclers out there accepting items or they wouldnt be stealing them
6335759 a lot of people have talked about this in theory for some time but it was fascinating to actually identify the chemicals
6335760 our hope is that by changing the sequence we can get sensors that respond differently to chemicals they are exposed to
6335761 out of dozens and dozens of other signals that are floating around
6335762 doesnt know in advance what it is going to encounter
6335763 currently the hospitals use a standard test to work out how far the cancer has progressed and then they use this to determine the treatment the patient should receive
6335764 however we are potentially able to more accurately predict who would benefit from chemotherapy
6335765 chemotherapy can be very useful but can have a number of side effects so we only want to use it where we think theres a good chance it will help this test will help us determine that
6335766 there is a desperate need for more effective treatments for bowel cancer the problem is identifying which cancers need which treatments this discovery may show us the way to do that and help save a lot of lives
6335767 recently we discovered that grapefruit and these other fruit juices substantially decrease the oral absorption of certain drugs undergoing intestinal uptake transport
6335768 the concern is loss of benefit of medications essential for the treatment of serious medical conditions
6335769 this is just the tip of the iceberg im sure well find more and more drugs that are affected this way
6335770 the effect on grapefruit juice on some medicines is well established and where this applies it is clearly detailed in patient information leaflets
6335771 pharmacists will usually draw this matter to patients attention when dispensing their medicines this new research showing that apple and orange juice may enhance or reduce the effects of some medicines is interesting but it is only one study
6335772 usually further research is needed to establish that these interactions are significant
6335773 we and our readers were surprised to learn that the source of the funding of the charitable foundation was in fact a large corporation that could have an interest in the study results
6335774 it is important to ask whether a study on clinical outcomes in lung cancer should be directly underwritten in part by the tobacco industry
6335775 it had not been a practice at the time to ask people about the pedigree of their sources

6335779 not only were positive results more likely to be published but studies that were not positive in our opinion were often published in a way that conveyed a positive outcome
6335780 it tells you where they placed their bets before they saw the data
6335781 selective publication can lead doctors to make inappropriate prescribing decisions that may not be in the best interest of their patients and thus the public health
6335782 theres an expectation that if you get a positive result thats what youre supposed to do and if you get a negative result you have failed
6335783 with the proliferation of journals virtually anything can get published somewhere maybe not in the
6335784 we are taught that the medical literature is the holy grail
6335785 drug companies routinely bury studies showing their drugs dont work
6335786 its now or never if it keeps spreading its going to become such a problem that were never going to be able to get a handle on it
6335787 if someone is spraying to control soybean rust and they have kudzu close at hand it could allow that rust to come back to their field
6335788 all and every one is a suspect till proven otherwise

6335790 now isnt this better than sitting at a table a girl hasnt got but two sides to her at the table
6335791 helping small businesses improving local schools expanding job opportunities for ohioans and ensuring that more of them have access to health care
6335792 it wasnt enough for her just to break barriers in her own life
6335793 she was also determined to bring opportunity to all those who had been overlooked and left behind and in stephanie they had a fearless friend and unyielding advocate
6335794 she was so much a part of the community it is hard to imagine
6335795 she dedicated her life in public service to helping others and will continue to do so through organ donations
6335796 was a strong courageous and compassionate advocate for the poor and vulnerable
6335797 a passionate representative who worked tirelessly to make cleveland a better place for her constituents
6335798 my dear dear friend for more than 20 years dating back to our days as county prosecutors

6335800 connect leadership of the caribbean with african american members of congress just as the jewish members of congress are connected with israel
6335801 there were many more suggestions given me by the passengers for my attention i will strive for improvements i will propose changes
6335802 i think the team just came together the first time we played them cuba kicked our butts but that didnt deter us
6335803 we always fight we came together as one unit when we first started playing we played individually it was ugly and we made a lot of errors
6335804 the us team played very well however we didnt especially on service and reception
6335805 there were two points that differed from the preliminary game where cuba did very well on serve and reception
6335806 the us did it very well and we didnt they were very well prepared and played to their potential
6335807 my teammates had enough confidence in me to set me the ball to win the match and i was just thinking is this me did i just do that
6335808 we did all we could but theyre just too good
6335809 i think its basically experience communication knowing that we want the same thing and turning to each other when its tough and saying we can do this
6335810 were unique and different we have something special between us so we try to enhance those things whether its our chemistry our size our skill
6335811 we still need to keep improving on our weaknesses though were never satisfied not even after eight years together
6335812 a lot of players are where we were when we won in athens so there are great things for them in the future
6335813 were following the footsteps of women that we looked up to and now theyre getting ready to fill our shoes when were gone they just need to keep their heads up and keep going during the good times and the bad their desire and work are there
6335814 the seed has been sown now i am sure there are kids running around in jamaica wanting to be usain bolt
6335815 now that usain bolt has done this it may take us another 20 years to produce an athlete as outstanding as him but we will
6335816 usain being a young man is still maturing he was just enthusiastic very happy there was never any animosity it came from within what he does there is nothing negative for the sport he was just so overwhelmed at what was going on
6335817 he is funny playful happy and that is what came out after he ran
6335818 as soon as he took the first step i knew he would win
6335819 its not good for us but this is what happens in football one team loses and one team wins against argentina its always very difficult with a great rivalry
6335820 we learned so much from him im going to miss sam a lot
6335821 with will and mike mcdonald you knew the ball was going to be there every single time
6335822 i was a specialist in college and one of my closest friends is andy lee all pro punter for the ive been around special teams forever
6335823 you cant just kick to kick each kick has to have a purpose like the first kick at virginia or the first snap backed up
6335824 pousson is doing a great job in there were way ahead of where we were in the spring
6335825 i became accustomed to the kicking thing going from field goals to kickoffs
6335826 it was a little different because id never really kicked field goals in games toward the end of the season i realized i needed to be more relaxed on kickoffs and not so pumped up
6335827 if we are saying that the world cup will take place in south africa it is because the world cup will take place in south africa
6335828 we in fifa have been working since 2004 on south africa in south africa with south africa to make sure that this world cup will take place in south africa
6335829 in terms of the stadium construction programme our deadline for the confederation cup venues is december 2008 those stadiums are there and they are dealing with upgrades
6335830 for the rest of the stadiums the completion date is october 2009 eighty percent of those stadiums will be completed by july 2009
6335831 in terms of stadium readiness we can say here that will be ready by the end of 2009 all the stadiums will be complete for kick off
6335832 it is true we at fifa have talked about a plan b meaning that when there is something happening in a country where we are not in control of the problem when you have a natural catastrophe when you have to move when you have a disaster that is not in the control of fifa or of south africa then you move the event to somewhere else
6335833 the world cup is such an important event for us the most important event it pays for the rest of all our events we have to make sure that is a success and the 64 matches all take place
6335834 the world cup will take place in south africa but we have as any normal or good company an alternative if something is happening which is out of your control and that is why mr blatter talked about a plan b
6335835 camp is a month long so there isnt necessarily a clear start and a clear finish
6335836 i think there are 3 5 spots where i need to see one more situation
6335837 im talking about possibly scrimmaging on wednesday the majority of the team i feel very good about and even those few spots i feel good about but its just too close to call right now i was hoping it would be clear but after looking at it there are still those 3 5 spots that well need one more day
6335838 the numbers are within a percentage point here and there most likely well have one more scrimmage wednesday if nothing else to let the backup quarterbacks sort it out
6335839 from the very first day of fall camp when gaskins was very strong and came back confident and poised since that day kurt has just chipped away and chipped away
6335840 i would say saturday was another day of kurt doing what he does its close right now
6335841 sometimes it will be the best work ethic and diligence
6335842 it will take a combination of ability and work ethic for a player to be trusted in those roles reed white will be on the field sometimes just because he is outworking his opponents he may or may not be the most talented but all we need are 10 yards per return
6335843 this was his fourth concussion in his career and im responsible for him regardless of medical opinion it will be hard for me to allow him to perform again the risk is too great
6335844 the longer were around oneill chambers the more spectacular plays hell make
6335845 we already know a demonstrated ability to make plays but this program develops young men in terms of their day to day accountability work ethic discipline and the combination of all that will be formidable when hes a senior but i think even right now hes formidable
6335846 many people who would never throw for instance a plastic bag on the ground would go ahead and toss a cigarette butt on the ground and step on it and leave it there
6335847 i think it is safe to say we are looking towards that program again but it may be premature to say we are committed to it
6335848 ik kan me niet voorstellen dat mensen hier niets van weten hiervan zullen toch meerdere mensen deelgenoot zijn
6335849 ik doe dan ook een oproep mensen alstublieft help ons

6335854 we are writing today to inform you that in an effort to strengthen our efforts to devise the best possible design for the site and to increase the likelihood that a financially beneficial and viable project can move forward and begin generating revenue for the port we have decided to combine forces and work together
6335855 we believe the letter speaks for itself and look forward to working with the port to create an exciting new project that will revitalize an important part of the waterfront
6335856 hes obviously not happy with what happened it doesnt matter if i win six games or 20 games if we have success as a team thats the biggest thing thats whats important to us weve had a good run lately except for the stretch in houston and we bounced back from that so keep it going
6335857 i get to come back to work tomorrow and start over
6335858 tonights win is in large part because of the way matty went out and threw the ball and competed
6335859 its the way they approach football its what they bring im just feeding off the guys its a very high energy group of guys theyre really intense theyre really competitive willing to go at it day in and day out with a great attitude outgoing sort of attitude more so than other teams that weve had
6335860 i dont think john david booty and sam baker and fred davis were of that nature
6335861 they werent natured that way its not the way that they were
6335862 they were almost more cerebral type players as they go all the sudden you feel this jolt this voltage you know and its exciting its fun
6335863 try and take something every day to get better at
6335864 you can never not get better at something theres always an area that you can improve on so thats just something that we try to focus on
6335865 secondary coach rocky setos got these guys understanding our system our principles our style of play
6335866 theyre physical theyre fast theyre big we have no reason to hold back on our expectations for what theyre capable of doing
6335867 theyre so committed to learning the game and theyre both on the same page how much they seek the knowledge to learn the game is what allows them to play in unison together
6335868 he ran an extraordinary 40 yard dash time that im not even going to tell you because you wont believe it theres no end for what he cant do i think hes got all of the physical ability that you want and he works his butt off
6335869 harris is as hard nosed and tough as you can get just a fierce competitor
6335870 we really love what he brings his experience is important and his physical nature really separates him from other corners
6335871 he worked so hard to get back to that level it was just a hard time for him
6335872 we know we have to take it game by game
6335873 our main goal is to win the pac 10 and go to the rose bowl every year since thats all we can control
6335874 what theyve done over the past six or seven years is remarkable
6335875 we had a terrific run with the kids who won championships but they left us
6335876 seeing the change of leadership we sensed a whole new excitement about our program
6335877 we envisioned all of these guys taking over and being stars when we recruited them
6335878 now we get to see these guys come into their own
6335879 its games like this that take us to the level that we need to be at every week
6335880 how are you going to keep all those tailbacks happy
6335881 they all have their own unique style which is pretty cool
6335882 as a team i want to go all the way thats my main objective
6335883 hes really just matured in the system it makes it so we can have a lot of fun in the offense with him
6335884 to not let the ball touch the grass thats the number one thing
6335885 im way more confident im not hesitant in my blocking or running ability
6335886 i know im the power back im not real shifty but i can make you miss
6335887 its a very very difficult statement for that family that they have to deal with
6335888 we feel very sorry for what they have to go through right now
6335889 he was found guilty on three charges and hes gotta deal with that and theres no way he can be a student right now
6335890 not even thinking about that right now hes got something hes got to deal with
6335891 id like to play eight to 10 guys this year
6335892 i want 10 guys acting like they are number ones so i can play all 10
6335893 he just needs some quality reps when he comes back hopefully we can get him rocking for virginia
6335894 when jeff is out there it just adds another rock out there and keeps things in check
6335895 his communication level has gone up two fold hes barking out calls and directing traffic
6335896 last year he was a little tentative in that which most freshmen would be hes really taken ownership of the position
6335897 when holmes came in with the first group it seems like he is doing everything right
6335898 when a guy like sam baker has got the position its discouraging a little bit
6335899 sam is the best but it is a weight off my shoulders to try and be me without trying to beat sam out
6335900 of course its hard to replace all those all americans
6335901 but were not really worried about it were looking forward not back
6335902 me and kyle are taking the reins and leading these guys by example
6335903 im very confident in our group and were doing one hell of a job
6335904 we have to love to be miserable thats coach holts favorite saying
6335905 once we teach the younger players that theyre going to carry that same thing and show the other guys after we leave
6335906 youve got to learn to love to be miserable and excel while being miserable and learn to play at an optimum level when you really dont feel like it
6335907 were really deep and weve got some really great competition
6335908 weve got definite two deep kids that can play anywhere in the country
6335909 clay is a great dropper when we need him to drop into pass coverage
6335910 hes an excellent pass rusher and a really smart football player
6335911 averell missed spring ball so hes a little rusty but lately hes been moving better and its just a matter of time before he regains his form
6335912 were going to need both of them theres no doubt
6335913 if we can get great snaps from both those guys and get them playing recklessly then i think were going to be good
6335914 the rush that affects the quarterback to make his mistakes in throwing the football is really one of the biggest areas that you can benefit from
6335915 i think number one were going to play the run really well i think were physical and i think we chase the ball really well

6335921 we believe our labeling will be even more detailed to allow consumers to make the best possible choice
6335922 unless all of the companies use the same method theres little point to the exercise
6335923 most people dont know what the term carbon footprint really means
6335924 but we hope this will be a launch pad for other companies to take part and increase public awareness
6335925 im country where i grew up i was told to be polite to everybody
6335926 i feel good that game is behind me and i feel very fortunate they gave me another shot
6335927 we started doing rice but we didnt do very much mostly cotton soybeans and corn youll see me wearing cotton shorts around im a big fan of cotton
6335928 thats where a lot of hard nosed players come from
6335929 i feel great i knew there was nothing seriously wrong with it
6335930 we need him to get back on the mound to be honest he could use a break you hate to have it happen this way
6335931 it was bang bang it was by hundredths of a second but i could do it
6335932 people at the museum are just overjoyed at getting this material back
6335933 there were fears that it could have been melted down
6335934 given bill reids relationship with the museum of anthropology the special connection with the material to get it all back with the exception of this missing piece is almost everything that could have been hoped for
6335935 when the prime minister visited new brunswick last week we believed he was going to correct the flawed agent orange compensation package and announce that families of victims who died prior to 2006 would be compensated
6335936 people are saying wait before embarking on a big change
6335937 to get sovereignty on the agenda as soon as possible
6335938 not only to change horses but go to a completely different animal
6335939 that what was discussed in momin khawajas presence had everything to do with going to afghanistan to fight and nothing to do with bombs in downtown london
6335940 we wouldnt want someone to go home leave their waders for a couple of days then go fishing in another watershed
6335941 the pattern was people in certain long term care facilities
6335942 the median age in the males is 76 and in the females is 80
6335943 this is a company that has a culture of food safety
6335944 were taking appropriate broad comprehensive and definitive action as it relates to this facility
6335945 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6335946 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6335947 if the status quo of aboriginal economic and educational initiatives continues street gangs and violent activity will increase and already marginalized aboriginal populations will experience a diminishing quality of life
6335948 the fallout from aboriginal poverty is all too obvious and will only get worse
6335949 their spread from urban centres to reserves is not a sign of organizational growth but rather the continuing unhealthy social state of these communities
6335950 the rcmp has engaged in past initiatives directed at aboriginal people and we should play yet still a greater role if we want to make a difference in their communities as well as strengthen our understaffed ranks
6335951 such an initiative would be akin to the marshall plan that rebuilt europe in the 1950s
6335952 at the same time if these aboriginal candidates decided not to join the rcmp but go on to other careers this would still benefit their communities
6335953 reports indicate that the taliban are covertly building their strength
6335954 it surprises me and its going to be disturbing for some folks
6335955 the canadian public has been so conditioned to see this war as improvised explosive devices and mines but were going to have to acknowledge that theyve stepped up a rung on the ladder and are capable of mounting conventional attacks again
6335956 i strongly advise the public especially those at high risk for listeriosis such as the elderly pregnant women and those with weak immune systems to make sure they avoid consuming these products
6335957 i have also asked all public health units to advise emergency rooms in their jurisdictions to be on alert for cases all suspect and confirmed cases of listeriosis must be reported immediately to local public health units and in turn to the ministry within one business day of notification of report
6335958 some of the products have been associated with that investigation
6335959 we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause but food safety and quality at mcdonalds will not be compromised
6335960 this was shocking to all of us to the medical community
6335961 this was the first time in history that a baby was reported dying from breast milk
6335962 if that duplication of the gene may be five per cent which we believe it is for the canadian public in general this is 5 000 babies a year just in canada that may be exposed to that risk of mom being an ultra metabolizer
6335963 there was another severe poisoning that might have been fatal but mom also was very groggy so she stopped breastfeeding
6335964 so probably the baby was saved by not being breastfed
6335965 babies are much more sensitive to morphine than we thought in the past
6335966 we can no longer take our extensive water supplies for granted
6335967 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water
6335968 national forecasting of water availability has never been done because traditionally our use of the resource was thought to be unlimited

6335975 canada lacks sound information at a national scale on the major uses and user s of water

6335977 our lack of data places canada at strategic disadvantage for bilateral negotiations with the u s
6335978 this report is a one stop shop document that can guide us toward ensuring that we get clean safe water to canadians wherever they choose to live
6335979 the fact is that the private system exists and like it or not it is here to stay
6335980 we need to accommodate it in order for the public system to prosper
6335981 we have one of the most costly and least efficient health systems of any industrialized country
6335982 its not for everyone its not all doctors who will go to the private side thats for sure and its not feasible everywhere
6335983 does it make sense in the face of a shortage of operating rooms to ban surgeons who provide 90 per cent of their services in a hospital from performing five to 10 per cent of their surgeries in a private clinic
6335984 i totally agree with dr ouellet that we need to do better but most of my patients cant afford to go to dr ouellets clinics
6335985 were going to have to find solutions that benefit everyone and not just people who can afford to pay
6335986 theres just no market outside of major cities for this kind of thing
6335987 the uzbeks have got us thinking were going to have to work on our system and our system only and make sure that we can adapt in the first five minutes to whatever gets thrown at us
6335988 its important that we get together now to prepare for what will possibly be our toughest qualifier for the world cup because we go into the unknown against uzbekistan
6335989 where can i see you on the public web site
6335990 i really enjoy playing music and its a family tradition
6335991 my great grandparents performed in the esperance music festival and my grandparents are still involved as part of the brass band
6335992 you cant really still play sport when your 80 but ill still be able to play piano
6335993 when you walk up on stage and accept a certificate that youve earned it makes you feel really proud
6335994 there were a lot of people who didnt know about the different types of community services available and the people who worked in these services
6335995 the idea is just to know whos providing what in the community and what difficulties the agencies might have in delivering those services
6335996 the more applicants we receive the more we realise the amount of need there is out there from community services
6335997 i had a goal to have this company look after esperance and also regional wa

6336019 hemos hecho una pedazo de salida y en la segunda manga hemos tenido algunos problemas pues el australiano se ha acercado mucho y el argentino estaba justo detr s no s porqu raz n hemos dejado de correr al principio de la segunda ce ida no s si por un pl stico o algo pero de repente nos hemos visto muy lentos despu s hemos vuelto a alargar igual es que est bamos en un zona mala y luego la popa ha sido aguantar a veces tir bamos nosotros o que los australianos no quer an forzar pues ten an asegurada la plata y hemos estado ah tanteando unas veces a tope y otras veces relaj ndonos pero con presi n total hasta el ltimo segundo
6336020 no nos hemos enterado en la segunda ce ida los alemanes ya nos han dejado de preocupar pues los dos primeros estaban bien colocados y ellos si quer an estar en disposici n de hacer algo deb an estar en esos puestos nos hemos olvidado de ellos y nos hemos concentrado en el australiano y sabiendo que los argentinos estaban detr s

6336037 my philosophy of ministry is strongly flavoured by my experiences overseas i embrace this and am attempting to translate that experience synergistically into my context here consequently i am passionate about mission as an organising principle for a community of disciples who gather around jesus as their living middle i am committed to that ground people in the deep channel of scripture and a developing biblical worldview to the point where it is self sustaining sensitive to the spirit of god and actively seeking accountable relationships with other disciples who are further along in the journey discover amp exercise their spiritual gifts both individually amp corporately to creatively experiment amp to tenaciously fail forwards together for the sake of kingdom of god that moves beyond prestige and comfort for the sake of those who are yet to encounter jesus anywhere in our global village

6336109 i do not know much but i have also heard about it
6336110 there was a guy who rang me and told me about rangers but i referred them only to my agent martin dahlin
6336111 there is no doubt we will go up there this weekend with the result on the final day of last season still fresh in the memory
6336112 we need to get a bit of revenge for that as it was a painful night for all of us and we will be desperate to come back down the road with three points this time around
6336113 when we lost up there in may i dont think the circumstances helped us
6336114 the surgeon reckons he will have to perform open surgery as opposed to the keyhole procedure ryan had done before
6336115 he will have another scan and whatever the problem is they will fix it with open surgery
6336116 ryan will do well to return before the end of the season
6336117 he is young enough to come back but this is extremely unfortunate
6336118 we have strong competition for places at centre back but ryan performed well in pre season and started against hibs
6336119 he was probably one of the first names down on the teamsheet for that game my difficult choice was who would partner him
6336120 so for this to happen on the opening day of the season was a huge blow
6336121 its a real test of character to come through that and the way he performed in pre season proved he had
6336122 he did a lot of work over the summer so he would be right for the season
6336123 when they try to draw these lines that everything points toward immigration it has nothing to do with it
6336124 its an avenue to say please dont arrest immigrants because we have other crime problems because of this enforcement
6336125 i do feel its escalating to the point where you wonder what is going to happen
6336126 it is a hard issue but when people believe they are being racially profiled thats a big issue taxpayers have a right to question that
6336127 most of the lenders if not all of the lenders are making private loans more difficult
6336128 lender costs have increased and their revenue has been reduced
6336129 as a community college our students can only borrow up to a certain level of loan because theyre considered a freshman or sophomore
6336130 lenders were very loose on the qualifications in the past
6336131 since then many firms have either pulled out of private loans or have made their qualifications more stringent
6336132 generally a private school will work with certain lenders to help their students find funding and some of these lenders are leaving the business
6336133 in many cases students with a credit history who would have been eligible for private loans nine months ago now are not because the lending community has changed its criteria
6336134 you guys have the wrong guy i swear to god

6336137 we know the importance of arresting the outstanding felons the violent felons the felons that are causing the most harm to the community
6336138 we are not alone the county has had some projects along with the federal government
6336139 the private sector is working off the investment governments have made
6336140 after consideration of all the information it doesnt appear that there is sufficient evidence to sustain any criminal charges beyond a reasonable doubt
6336141 our office will not be taking any further action in this matter
6336142 the undersheriff and i are pleased but far from surprised by this outcome
6336143 there was never any real dispute as to what had occurred nor that we were investigating allegedly criminal conduct which under the law allows us to record that meeting
6336144 this is obviously the conclusion reached by the attorney general
6336145 the decision of the attorney general does not exonerate the actions of the sheriff it merely identifies that they may not be able to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt
6336146 the attorney generals decision is irrelevant to the merits of hovings claims
6336147 the attorney general examined only elements of state law hovings federal claims center on constitutional law
6336148 we continue to believe that the federal case is strong and we intend to proceed to trial on all claims
6336149 i ask myself do i really want to hold this group hostage to that process

6336155 he went over his ankle in the first half on sunday hurting it as his momentum carried him behind the goal
6336156 he did well to carry on as he did but the ankle is swollen today
6336157 the fact he is young and should heal quickly is a plus though so hopefully he will be okay
6336158 fran has done a bit of running over the past couple of days so i would say he is getting there fitness wise
6336159 i know the reasons im not going to go and make them public
6336160 i will need to speak to one or two but as a team in general we need to roll the sleeves up get back to basics regroup and say right were not a good side
6336161 but were going to work hard to be a good side
6336162 quido was sucking air a bit on monday as he wasnt used to the pace of the training
6336163 we had another hard session today and we could see he has a good football brain
6336164 technically he is very good but we have seen dutch defenders here in the past who have been very good in possession of the ball but when it comes to the physical side of the game they struggle
6336165 some of them have it and some dont we have a week to find out if quido has it
6336166 if you are a centre forward you can score goals in training and if you are a winger you can cross balls and impress but as a defender you have to show aggression as well as technical ability
6336167 we are due to hear on friday whether maurice has been granted a work permit
6336168 even if he does get one he will have to go to the uk embassy in america to get it processed
6336169 so logistically there is no chance he would be able to play for rangers on saturday
6336170 you have to remember he has done a lot of travelling and is currently trying to focus on the united states game in guatemala but i am sure he will be a great addition to rangers
6336171 im going to miss toronto but this is a great opportunity for me toronto fc will always have special meaning for me because its the club that gave me my professional start im really looking forward to the big rangers v celtic derby game everyone i speak to about it has been hyping that game up

6336209 budgeting may not sound exciting but it is the no 1 sure fire way to save money
6336210 the key is to set goals with your spouse and children whether the goal is to save on weekly grocery bills save for a vacation next summer or save for kids education write down the goals and build your budget with the goals in mind that will dictate month to month expenditures and take the guesswork out of what you can spend for back to school items
6336211 we all know this but putting it into action takes thought and planning
6336212 in other words if you are used to making a day of back to school shopping think twice skip the lunch out just shop and go home
6336213 or reward the kids for their shopping patience with a picnic and playtime at a park you will all be more motivated to get the shopping done
6336214 buying only what you need is the best way to curb spending

6336421 for more than 250 years timelines have been a useful tool for the temporal visualization of events
6336422 my timeline originally published in 1994 is unique in its use of quantitative and qualitative data across a variety of domains as well as historical and futures perspectives
6336423 the next two to three decades will see deep fundamental changes occurring across multiple technological social political economic and environmental domains this timeline was developed as a tool to provide insights that will help us understand these changes
6336424 timelines can be a powerfully effective tool for analyzing events both in the past and the future providing insights into long term changes and provoking thought and discussion about the future
6336425 we feel that our timeline offers greater insight than many others with its uniquely rich overlays of events trends drivers and archetypal patterns of change spanning america and the world

6336441 as a nation we are getting more adventurous when it comes to our holidays and although its great to see new places its also very important that travellers understand the risks they face if they are going to a potentially dangerous destination foreign travel is so commonplace these days but wed urge anyone going on holiday this summer to pay attention to the government travel advice http www fco gov uk en travelling and living overseas travel advice by country action notravelall notravelall
6336442 aside from the obvious risks to safety the vast majority of travel insurers http www lv com insurance travel insurance will not provide cover for areas that the government warns against visiting so travellers need to do their research thoroughly before booking an unusual destination
6336443 although the lv travel insurance policy http www lv com insurance travel insurance will cover travellers if they fall ill with one of these diseases if they didnt get vaccinated many insurers will not meaning policy holders will have no medical cover and are at an increased risk of becoming seriously ill
6336444 i looked up knee replacement in india on the internet and thats when i came across medical tourism corporation at that stage i had still not made up my mind though but the quick responses and extremely professional communication from medical tourism corporation helped me discuss the matter with my family members and arrive at a collective decision

6336450 the models tested here confirmed that the health of individual employees and in particular their mental health is a key contributor to productivity loss
6336451 but these models also attest to how other factors measured by a comprehensive hra like the wellness checkpoint contribute to both impaired performance while at work and time away from work these factors exert their influence on productivity loss that are both independent of health and are considerable in their magnitude above and beyond the contribution of health
6336452 the result in this study is a wealth of information that can be used for shaping and guiding efforts to reduce productivity loss this information can help to build the rationale and consensus for taking action
6336453 health is not the only accessible and measurable candidate for intervention efforts

6336461 the role of security information and event management in security governance risk management and compliance
6336462 organizations of all sizes are compelled to demonstrate compliance with industry and government regulations industry standards and best practices or internal policies related to information security
6336463 these policies as the explicit expression of an organizations business objectives and their view of the optimal balance between protection compliance and profit provide the foundation for the most effective security governance risk management and compliance programs although their capabilities are still developing there is clear evidence that companies with top performance are taking proactive steps to ensure that investments in security and compliance controls directly support the strategic objectives for the business
6336464 by effectively allocating it resources based on business objectives and acceptable levels of risk organizations improve security sustain compliance improve leverage from existing it resources make faster decisions and optimize business processes
6336465 many organizations are leveraging siem solutions to track analyze and manage how the requirements expressed by their policies are being satisfied then they utilize siem results to drive appropriate actions and behavior by the relevant stakeholders users of siem solutions are achieving superior results in security grc as siem provides an active continuous self adjusting link between policy and behavior

6336469 ready steady move lessons promote the vital mind body connection in childrens brains stimulating both right and left side brain functions for increased learning abilities along with better physical health
6336470 comprehension is immediate and long lasting because this type of learning creates more neural networks in the childs brain
6336471 another reason is that its simply more fun just watch children in a ready steady move lesson
6336472 in hungary like elsewhere children spend too much time watching television or sitting in front of a computer also because of the reduction in phys ed lessons in schools parents are enthused about enrolling their children in a fun all inclusive movement class that also helps them practice english
6336473 we plan to run ready steady move in budapest and the larger cities the first year with a projected target of 1000 2000 children hopefully doubling or even tripling that number in the coming year

6336481 however we emphasize the more immediate message your vote is your voice use it
6336482 it is a scandal that in the 21st century we are still conducting absentee voting largely as we did during world war ii by sending absentee ballot applications and ballots across oceans and continents by snail mail
6336483 it should be possible to implement a system enabling deployed military personnel to vote electronically with assurance that their ballots will indeed by counted
6336484 we can understand the frustration of the disenfranchised military voter
6336485 but we maintain that the military needs to vote and tell the us government to count us in we need the help of those who enjoy the right to vote in part because our troops past and present protect that right we ask voters families of the active military and veterans to go to www countusin us and follow the steps to make a difference
6336486 we wanted to add the on line option to our regular classroom sessions
6336487 excavators can complete the training at their convenience and we can score the results and keep a record of completion the team at midwest energy association combined our requirements with their diggingsafely com national excavation safety service and produced a unique missouri course the collaboration has been excellent we especially like the ability to update the course and adjust it to insure learning is effective
6336488 even though missouri state law requires everyone to call us at 1 800 dig rite or call the national 811 number we must constantly encourage people to make the call or go to our website to request that underground utilities are marked prior to excavation
6336489 with the new course there is even more enticement to go to our website damage to underground utility lines not only is costly and inconveniences customers it can also be dangerous for excavation employees
6336490 we built the primary course at the diggingsafely com site
6336491 based on the underground damage prevention best practices of the common ground alliance a national coalition of electric gas water cable telecommunications and rail companies don szambelan our chief learning officer and his team then offered to customize the course on a state by state basis missouri was the first to step up they wanted missouri specific information on regulations and procedures as well as excavation safety training other state one call systems are interested and we look forward to working with them damage prevention is in everyones interest

6336515 die vp burgenland war immer eine loyale organisation zur bundespartei und wir werden auch diesmal unseren beitrag leisten
6336516 da wir aber gerade eine landtagswahl gehabt haben stellt es nat rlich eine herausforderung f r uns dar
6336517 and after the meeting was over his lawyer i believe it was his lawyer saw me looking at that bottle and he smiled at me and took the bottle and walked away
6336518 well i think the situation calls for chocolate and caramel and a little grill out with a good bottle of wine
6336519 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
6336520 this training event will cover every aspect and issue that a security company will face when dealing with these sophisticated geovision amp alnet dvr products and security cameras http www esentia com issues such as point of sale high definition ip cameras remote viewing amp recording router amp firewall issues amp more will be covered
6336521 its clearly not like it used to be with installing a vcr based system in order to be successful todays modern security company must possess a well rounded technical knowledge of how these sophisticated dvr systems work
6336522 a large portion of our clients are it consulting firms and systems integrators since most of the sophisticated dvr card http esentia com category 102 products are now pc server based they have a major advantage over the traditional security company
6336523 19 is fine 18 is perfect 17 is good 16 is okay 15 is pushing it 14 is going a little too far 13 is mostly just no 12 is fail
6336524 its fantastic to see so many people here we want to involve as many of our customers as possible in how we manage our homes throughout the day weve received lots of positive and valuable feedback that we will use to develop our services and everyone who has come along has had a really enjoyable day
6336525 if you had told me last night id do 87 45 i would have said i had to make the medals
6336526 of course im a bit disappointed to be 30 odd seconds away from the medals but when i saw the pace and how quickly it was going i knew it was too fast
6336527 i remember thinking around 12 14km god this is tough
6336528 i did amazingly well and couldnt have done any more i was prepared for it to be hot today but i smiled when i saw the weather
6336529 the market is telling you that they think there is a relatively good chance of a deal getting done
6336530 theres a big negative feedback loop and theres no way out of it
6336531 as the stock falls more and more its more likely the government steps in and more likely equity holders get wiped out
6336532 they havent offered anything and we havent asked for anything
6336533 they cant keep playing games with the accounting rules to avoid taking their losses
6336534 it could be tomorrow it could be six months from now
6336535 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6336536 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6336537 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6336538 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6336539 why is it beyond the wit of our country to be able to provide the resources and encouragement in supporting australians who are unemployed to go to areas where they can get seasonal work
6336540 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6336541 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6336542 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6336543 some of the reports weve had out today have been slightly negative despite some coming out with higher profit theyre indicating forward earnings are coming under pressure
6336544 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6336545 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6336546 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6336547 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important
6336548 victoria is in catch up mode and the premier if he is really serious about fighting cancer should have brought in some of these measures over the past 12 months
6336549 weve been able to resolve all of the outstanding issues between us
6336550 this allows us to go forward and build the much needed public housing
6336551 its a little bit of a drag because flying is sort of my downtime
6336552 but its fantastic to be connected for the productivity you get i was also able to chat and watch my slingbox video
6336553 there will be peaks and valleys but thats the nature of the beast with wireless
6336554 but imagine trying to run wires up to 30 000 feet
6336555 how long did it take marconi and the wright brothers to get together and thats what we have here in this convergence two vastly different approaches to bringing people together and communicating
6336556 my sense is that sutter has recognized it is time to settle in a way that addresses the more important critical issues that we have raised
6336557 the medical center is extremely pleased to have come to a tentative agreement on a contract that provides our valued nurses with exceptional wages and benefits
6336558 huge in bringing up the issues of what the fight was about
6336559 that is still important we will have that struggle another day
6336560 we have made some health care proposals but none of them could be characterized as massive takeaways
6336561 to the extent that it may have come across as a deliberate dishonesty it was not
6336562 may fall within the ambit of a crime against the administration of justice whether it be attempting to defeat or obstruct the administration of justice or contempt of court
6336563 an accurate statement of what occurred based on the judge presidents own version of events
6336564 they came straight at me i tried to run away but they caught me one of them started punching me while another gave me electric shocks with a device he held in his hands
6336565 this affected me very much it will not be easy for me to start working as a security guard again im scared now
6336566 bottega veneta is truly a icon of luxury and elegance with that typically fine conservative italian quality that you would pay anything for the privilege of owning the leather goods are some of the best made i have ever seen and the homeware collection combines subtlety with beauty and incredible class this was my first visit to the ny store and without any doubt the service was as super efficient and the selection as plentiful as it is at the stores in europe when you see how finely made the goods are here you know its well worth the expense

6336569 i check gamesindustry biz every day you have to to know whats going on its definitely the best european news site and is beginning to offer a more global view too theres a ton of information and news on the net but this is the one that matters
6336570 thats high enough to see the curvature of the earth and the stars of space
6336571 there isnt a geek out there who hasnt dreamed of being an astronaut
6336572 the currency advantage that was in place has gone away this year
6336573 we think we have a secular bottom in the u s dollar
6336574 started in february and picked back up over the last several months
6336575 i certainly wouldnt get rid of an international fund just because it has underperformed in the past year
6336576 if the fund is chosen for the right reason it fits into an overall investment strategy has solid management and reasonable costs there is every reason to hold one shouldnt really expect a fund to be in positive territory if markets are down double digits
6336577 its coming down temporarily but its not coming down long term no way
6336578 just because the price has dropped a little that doesnt mean its going to stay there
6336579 will people be driving more at 4 than they would have if gas went up to 5 the answer has to be definitely yes
6336580 but 4 is not 2 its still a big hit to your pocketbook
6336581 couples just dont talk about money and this secrecy invariably leads to problems
6336582 bottega veneta is truly a icon of luxury and elegance with that typically fine conservative italian quality that you would pay anything for the privilege of owning the leather goods are some of the best made i have ever seen and the homeware collection combines subtlety with beauty and incredible class this was my first visit to the ny store and without any doubt the service was as super efficient and the selection as plentiful as it is at the stores in europe when you see how finely made the goods are here you know its well worth the expense
6336583 the resulting gasoline is completely compatible with current infrastructure meaning absolutely no change to consumers cars
6336584 the process uses non arable land and non potable undrinkable water and delivers 10 to 100 times more energy per acre than cropland biofuels
6336585 way back when when the algae were responsible for creating the long chain hydrocarbons like diesels and heavy oils the biomass just got buried and compressed and formed crude oil
6336586 id say its a very sound idea but the question is are they able to do anything practical in an efficient way
6336587 the key questions are the efficiency with which this process happens they also have the classic renewables problem in that youre dealing with the ultimate energy source the sun which is quite diffuse so youre only getting in peak conditions around 0 5kw per square metre you need vast farms
6336588 the world began without the human race and it will end without it
6336589 when one admits that nothing is certain one must i think also admit that some things are much more nearly certain than others
6336590 the polls show 25 percent of her supporters have not gotten on board

6336595 with hebron we are launching a new era of energy projects in which we the people of newfoundland and labrador are stepping forward and proudly taking our place as full partners and active participants in energy resource development
6336596 the hebron project is key to our canada growth strategy and is one of many projects in our global portfolio that will allow us to grow our reserves and production moreover chevron canada is also pursuing long term growth through the development of legacy assets in the alberta oil sands and northern canada
6336597 chevrons participation in the hebron project gives our company a strategic platform for growth on the east coast of canada where we are exploring for impact sized resources in the orphan basin and have a major financial interest in the hibernia offshore oil project
6336598 we have more generations produced this year than we do in an average year
6336599 normally we expect three four or maximum five weve probably had around eight or nine generations so lots of habitat lots of mosquitoes
6336600 thats what they use as a cue for exposed skin tissues to try to get at blood vessels
6336601 you dont find mosquitoes standing on the bluffs of prospect for example
6336602 theyre not designed to cope with any strong winds theyre designed for quieter areas so if youre playing golf and end up in the woods a lot then youre more likely to come across them
6336603 if you have larvae and pupae in fresh waters then thats a great source of food for larval fish
6336604 good if youre a brook trout not if youre a brook trout fisherman

6336609 as i land one of the first things i tell people is that if theyre needing a pee break right now if they go into the woods they will disturb the mosquitoes and there will be a ton of them and they will follow us out to the beach
6336610 they swarm and suddenly you have a few hundred mosquitoes it seems biting you
6336611 never before in the history of our energy industry have we taken the bold steps that we are taking today

6336613 whether they paid too high a price to get into this project remains to be seen
6336614 the coffee is cold and the donuts are stale by the time information gets down to the end of the table

6336619 i was deeply saddened to learn of the dreadful loss of life in todays aircraft crash at barajas airport in madrid the news of which has shocked us all
6336620 the second half of august should be better than the first
6336621 as long as the rain stays away we should be all right
6336622 now ive got about 16 acres 6 4 hectares of it out there
6336623 theres five farms in this area and were all affected
6336624 we need to spray more fungicides so it adds to the cost of production
6336625 its a big concern and the fields are not looking good
6336626 were certainly concerned about what effect the weathers going to have it might be too late i dont know
6336627 the rain isnt detrimental because its plumped up the berries
6336628 door te weigeren vrouwen een hand te geven maakt hij echter zelf wel onderscheid
6336629 the obvious suspicion is some kind of engine problem the suspicion is that for whatever reason the aircraft had insufficient power to pull away
6336630 im convinced that in fabio capello the england team has the right manager and a genuine chance of success
6336631 i am sad to be leaving the fa an organisation it has been a privilege to lead but i believe it is in the best interests of all parties

6336635 brian leaves with our best wishes for the future and will always be welcome back as our guest at wembley
6336636 i dont think that can be answered at this time
6336637 i believe the hospital doctors went through the entire scenario and worst case scenarios
6336638 that was only to get informed consent in any case of dehydration if the iv fluids do not produce the desired results thats always an option
6336639 the guidelines for it are different in china than the united states i had translator related discussions with doctors and theyre a small amount more liberal in doing it dialysis but thats not necessarily a bad thing
6336640 i think with all due caution considered thats the reason he didnt compete
6336641 its almost like a flea market youve got guys walking into the aisles with their hands out
6336642 that makes it a little easier on a person thats looking for work
6336643 were quickly sending them to the yard to get an application in
6336644 if we can find the right people well hire as many as we can find
6336645 we always get a very good response from the job fair

6336647 im trying to see what opportunities lafayette has to offer
6336648 im trying to get my name out there and hopefully get some experience before i graduate
6336649 its very obvious from the employer side that theres a huge demand
6336650 a girl cut in two the blonde beauty plays a weathergirl caught between an older author fran ois berl and and a rich younger man chabrol alum benoit magimel symbaloo
6336651 much more needs to be done to create the access necessary for the oil industry to do what it does best and develop this countrys resources to secure our energy security
6336652 this is where we have found success and we are the clear leader
6336653 we came here to win and we are leaving winners

6336655 the american academy of pediatrics has come out with a statement recommending that all children be breastfed for at least a year and after that there is no time when it is not beneficial
6336656 breast milk continues to offer babies the absolute most perfect nutrition possible and since it provides babies with immunities that continue to protect the child especially when it has to go into some kind of child care setting its more important because it provides the baby with immunities that keeps them well
6336657 for 10 years ive been taking my body where it didnt want to go going up and down in weight
6336658 dialysis was mentioned at first because his kidneys were operating so poorly but u s olympic team doctors were against it and daniel was against it
6336659 the numbers are dropping and it looks like hell have normal kidney function
6336660 this is hard to believe i just cant believe this
6336661 i said at the beginning of camp none of these spots are etched in stone as we evaluate the film adjusting the depth chart is certainly something we will look strongly at but the thing that is troubling is that were going to find it goes around the room
6336662 there werent a lot of things we did well on defense so we have to get that corrected we are going to end up in these games 30 something to 30 something all year long so that is not a good thing
6336663 im anxious to see first getting mike mckenzie back and how much hes able to go
6336664 well put a number of guys through i dont anticipate usama young being able to practice or play throughout the course of this week so well keep rotating guys through and have a lot of rotations both in the base and in the nickel
6336665 there were some effort plays that bothered us that he needs to clean up
6336666 there was a third down shallow cross where he lost his guy across the field
6336667 hes now put a couple of weeks of practice under his belt after the hamstring that he had and well give him plenty of snaps and also as a returner
6336668 were going to look at lance moore were going to look at reggie bush were going to look at tracy porter and skyler green
6336669 those four guys are really the guys that are competing at that punt return position
6336670 hopefully in this game well get a chance to see a few more punts to evaluate the punt returners and well go from there
6336671 i thought i did well it was just good to be out there on the field again
6336672 i just wanted to get out there and do what i could
6336673 i think that hes smart enough not to overdo it and hes getting reps and getting work and hes been in the walkthroughs
6336674 we just have to be mindful of how many reps and how much we give him the main objective is to see him at 100 when we play tampa bay
6336675 the thing about fibromyalgia is that when you see me i can look perfectly normal
6336676 family members look at you and think nothing is wrong with you
6336677 the doctors in the old days they just wanted to say you were a hypochondriac or crazy and wanted to medicate you with uppers or downers
6336678 fibromyalgia is a mechanical musculo skeletal disorder that manifests as all over body pain fatigue anxiety and depression
6336679 one of the things thats very important is that fibromyalgia is not inflammatory or autoimmune in nature which differentiates it from lupus rheumatoid arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica
6336680 i ran into somebody the other day that said they didnt believe in it
6336681 its a complex disorder and understanding fibromyalgia is difficult what people dont believe in is the fact that there isnt an actual cause and effect phenomenon that were used to
6336682 there are substances that cause pain and they are elevated in the brain of fibromyalgia patients theres a substance called substance p and another one called glutamate
6336683 my own impression is that fibromyalgia patients have stress like everybody else but they never escape from the stress
6336684 if a doctor does a pressure point test and if they touch any one of them most of us will go sky high
6336685 if you take a group of young adults and deprive them of sleep especially the deepest stages of sleep they will have fibromyalgia symptoms after a couple of days
6336686 people get caught up in vicious cycles of body pain increased anxiety and depression the worse the anxiety and depression is the worse the sleep is it goes in both directions
6336687 these are symptoms that are hard to treat because they are not symptoms that damage tissues just symptoms that cause pain
6336688 the reason antidepressants work is not because of the antidepressant effect
6336689 the parliament of nsw has a clear responsibility to the people of nsw to pass the legislation to ensure the economy of nsw is on a firm footing for the future

6336691 this battle will continue until such time as the government withdraws these proposals from the parliament
6336692 by instituting this three year cutback this would allow external agencies a period of time to secure any offsetting funding
6336693 many agencies have are and will continue to make a difference
6336694 if you start cutting things then you begin to take away services every single one of them could express their value and their worth to the community
6336695 we introduced them to a more rigorous curriculum so that they were exposed to everything
6336696 we had to gather in the locker room and make some adjustments
6336697 it really took everyone to make this happen the parents students administrators and the community
6336698 us realizing that were doing better is going to make us succeed
6336699 that fight scene from kill bill with super mario sounds dubbed in
6336700 weve got to be prepared for anything that may happen
6336701 we are doing everything in our power to protect our forces
6336702 i may do it in the future but i dont think im going to do it right now

6336727 they were trashing it so bad the city got onto me i said the city is the one that needs to help me with this
6336728 to say theyre not bothering anyone or doing anything wrong is a misnomer

6336836 and he said trace the history of the world from this notable event down to this day and you will find the fulfillment of this singular prophecy what could have been the design of the almighty in this singular occurrence is not for me to say but i can say the curse is not yet taken off from the sons of canaan neither will be until it is affected by as great a power as caused it to come and the people who interfere the least with the purposes of god in this matter will come under the least condemnation before him and those who are determined to pursue a course which shows an opposition and a feverish restlessness against the decrees of the lord will learn when perhaps it is too late for their own good that god can do his own work without the aid of those who are not dictated by his counsel i must not pass ever a notice of the history of abraham of whom so much is spoken in the scripture if we can credit the account god conversed with him from time to time and directed him in the way he should walk saying i am the almighty walk before me and be thou perfect

6336854 where to start you curtwood dannon are what is known as an empath you know the word
6336855 ive heard the term before cant say i know exactly what you mean by that though
6336856 fair enough the word has been misused quite a bit by those new age imbeciles who like to blather on and on about feelings and such you however are the real thing put simply you have the ability to make people feel emotionally what you want them to feel
6336857 make people feel what i want them to feel is that what you think cus if so i think youve got the wrong guy
6336858 oh no mr dannon we have the right guy you just never knew you had this ability and therefore were never aware of using it although use it you did and quite frequently
6336859 you have this ability because you are in fact the descendant of a long ago mating between a human and an angel from a forgotten time when such things were more acceptable this ability shows up in your particular bloodline once every 10 generations
6336860 wait a second are you telling me that my great great times a million grandfather is an angel
6336861 there was some unpleasantness many centuries ago im sure you have heard a rather skewed version of those events if youve ever gone to church but they are not important at the moment
6336862 we prefer the term free angels mr dannon if such a term has to be used at all even still the one who started your bloodline is no longer with us free or otherwise
6336863 hmmmmmm got taken out in the big battle back then huh can angels actually die then
6336864 i fear we are getting off track a bit there will be time for history lessons and family trees later for now it is my job to make you aware of your importance in the big scheme of things
6336865 where exactly were you heading in your drunken stupor last night mr dannon can you remember
6336866 im sure shes an excellent girlfriend shes a model is she not
6336867 you already know she is why are you asking me
6336868 shes pretty successful at what she does is she not i thought i heard in fact that one of the more successful companies known for making models world famous approached her recently is that not true
6336869 well mr dannon lets be frank youre not exactly errol flynn are you
6336870 johnny depp brad pitt whoever the point is that you are not a dashingly handsome famous actor you are not a famous athlete you are not a famous musician you are not famous at all you are not particularly handsome and you are not even rich in fact by your own societys standards you are quite poor if not exactly living in squalor but you are quite simply not the kind of man that a woman like julie dates
6336871 fuck you shes in love with me maybe shes just not that shallow
6336872 could be could also be that you are almost impossibly adept at persuading women who would otherwise find you a less than favorable prospect to believe that they feel a strong love for you
6336873 come now mr dannon lets be honest you hardly believe that she loves you yourself this isnt that much of a surprise is it
6336874 im not trying to upset you but you do need to be aware of the truth
6336875 what does it all matter anyway im dead aint i dead and in hell
6336876 ah yes that well i may have misled you a bit there im afraid but it was necessary that you listen to me the truth is your body has not physically died yet our intent in fact is to send you back as one of our agents of course
6336877 yes mr dannon of course its why we traded for you with my help you will be able to hone your abilities to the height of their potential
6336878 wait a minute im not actually dead after all then
6336879 well deliberately misled i would say and i do apologise but again it was necessary i dont lie mr dannon its not my area of expertise
6336880 we are excellent employers mr dannon and we offer many extraordinary benefits i guarantee you will be happier than youve ever been
6336881 youre already working for us mr dannon i was completely serious when i told you that the other side traded for you you will end up with us eventually the point is to make the best of things with my help you can live the rest of your life on earth with everything you could possibly want and you will be looked at in a very favorable light when you are set to return to us
6336882 well how much time do i have to think about it
6336883 unfortunately mr dannon we are out of time you must go back now

6336918 tenemos los ajustes de cuentas entre los diferentes c rteles de la droga por los mercados del control territorial por el otro los narcotraficantes est n incursionando en otras actividades delictivas como es el secuestro la extorsi n a empresarios y el tr fico ilegal de inmigrantes una tercera raz n tiene que ver con la respuesta de los narcotraficantes a las acciones policiales militares que se han realizado en diferentes estados de la rep blica mexicana lo que trae como consecuencia mayores cr menes mayores v ctimas
6336919 la estrategia ha sido b sicamente represiva es decir el arresto de narcotraficantes la confiscaci n de drogas armas aviones etc pero de forma sistem tica han faltado labores de inteligencia militar y policial m s definidas para que los operativos sean m s precisos
6336920 mientras no se golpee ese nervio vital no se afectar la estructura financiera y el conjunto de la estructura criminal
6336921 la participaci n ciudadana por ejemplo es esencial porque sin duda es necesaria una mayor coordinaci n y cooperaci n entre el gobierno federal los gobiernos estatales y municipales
6336922 ya algunas voces alertan que esta mala reputaci n de m xico a escala internacional puede afectar las inversiones extranjeras o el crecimiento del turismo
6336923 se siente muy padre se siente muy bonito creo que tatiana y yo hemos trabajado mucho para este momento y yo creo que estar en la final es ya un m rito muy grande
6336924 me da mucho gusto de que podamos estar las dos representantes de m xico en la final por lo general casi no se hab a visto sol a haber un mexicano en la final esperemos tener muy buenos resultados para m xico
6336925 estoy contenta mas no es algo decisivo la final es una competencia totalmente diferente y a ver qu pasa lo m s importante es que los jueces ya saben qui nes somos las que podemos dar pelea y creo que es un buen par metro pero no decisivo
6336926 todas estamos muy fuertes muy pegaditas creo que va a ser una final muy interesante
6336927 en la final lo nico que quiero hace es mantenerme constante posiblemente me gustar a subir un poquito m s las calificaciones me gustar a que mi promedio fueran ochos y si se puede ochos y medios pero bueno me gusta mantenerme as constante
6336928 tal vez no son clavados espectaculares pero bueno a veces la constancia es la estrategia
6336929 no nos queda otra que luchar por la medalla de bronce
6336930 el saque y la recepci n nos han condenado hemos estado muy mal en estos dos aspectos b sicos del juego y ha repercutido en todo lo dem s no hemos hecho nuestro juego habitual en ning n momento del partido as es casi imposible ganar
6336931 estados unidos por el contrario estuvo muy bien en saque y efectu un ataque muy alto e inspirado al que nos fue imposible parar
6336932 los nervios de una semifinal ol mpica fueron para los dos equipos as que no creo que haya tenido influencia estados unidos y cuba son equipos de parecido nivel y si uno de ellos falla lo normal es que gane el otro en la primer fase jugamos bien contra las norteamericanas y las ganamos con claridad
6336933 no nos queda otra que luchar por el bronce vinimos a pek n a intentar conquistar la medalla de oro pero ahora ya no es posible el bronce tambi n es un xito para cuba porque que un pa s con once millones de habitantes sea el tercero del mundo ser a todo un triunfo
6336934 hemos pedido que las permitiera llevar crespones y nos han dicho que no
6336935 dedicamos el oro a los familiares de las v ctimas de madrid

6336937 como ha dicho fernando queremos dar el p same a todas las familias que han perdido seres queridos en ese accidente
6336938 peleado lo que no est escrito durante todo el campeonato
6336939 ahora mismo vamos a descansar vamos a asimilar lo que hemos hecho hoy y despu s empezar a trabajar duro para poder estar otra vez en lo m s alto
6336940 hemos estado liderando la clasificaci n durante toda la competici n desde el principio y eso a lo mejor te carga un poco m s de tensi n y m s que nada para celebrarlo con todo el mundo que nos ha seguido durante estos diez a os ahora vamos a disfrutar un poco de esta victoria
6336941 hemos hecho una pedazo de salida y en la segunda manga hemos tenido algunos problemas pues el australiano se ha acercado mucho y el argentino estaba justo detr s no s porqu raz n hemos dejado de correr al principio de la segunda ce ida no s si por un pl stico o algo pero de repente nos hemos visto muy lentos despu s hemos vuelto a alargar igual es que est bamos en un zona mala y luego la popa ha sido aguantar a veces tir bamos nosotros o que los australianos no quer an forzar pues ten an asegurada la plata y hemos estado ah tanteando unas veces a tope y otras veces relaj ndonos pero con presi n total hasta el ltimo segundo
6336942 no nos hemos enterado en la segunda ce ida los alemanes ya nos han dejado de preocupar pues los dos primeros estaban bien colocados y ellos si quer an estar en disposici n de hacer algo deb an estar en esos puestos nos hemos olvidado de ellos y nos hemos concentrado en el australiano y sabiendo que los argentinos estaban detr s
6336943 est bamos m s pendientes de no tener problemas de roturas de hacer bien las maniobras m s seguras que en otros momentos en los que aprietas m s para poder asegurar el entrar en cabeza
6336944 creo que me apresur un poco al finalizar y eso me perjudic
6336945 sali fuerte el brit nico yo intent estar siempre en la punta el octavo que es lo que me dijo mi entrenador
6336946 soy nuevo en aguas abiertas y es realmente una experiencia nica me he preparado muy bien y he hecho unos entrenamientos exigentes pero pienso que despu s de ser el n mero 27 hace un a o y ya ubicarme en la posici n que ubiqu ahorita es demasiado

6336955 no es un problema para m me siento bien cuando llueve porque en abril estuve entrenando en singapur y all siempre llov a volv a alemania y tambi n llovi el cuarenta por ciento de los d as estoy acostumbrada al agua no me preocupa
6336956 sufrimos fallamos varias oportunidades de gol en el primer tiempo y nos cost trabajo anotar
6336957 fue dif cil preparar el partido en poco tiempo pero estoy contento porque los jugadores lo dieron todo y logramos los tres t tulos
6336958 se fue el momento m s duro el del gol en contra pero supimos recuperarnos
6336959 tiene que madurar es un joven pero deber a mostrar m s respeto hacia sus rivales eso estar a m s acorde con el esp ritu del ideal ol mpico deber a darles la mano tras cruzar la meta
6336960 a m no me molesta que monte su show pero un apret n de manos o una palmadita en la espalda es un gesto necesario
6336961 esa no es la imagen que tiene un campe n
6336962 est en otra dimensi n hay que considerarle como a jesse owens en los a os 30 aunque tiene un margen m s importante sobre sus rivales y si lo mantiene puede dejar huella como owens

6336981 we cannot speculate the investigation is the responsibility of the civil aviation authority

6336983 its important that cancer services are tailored to suit teenagers and young adults as their needs differ from older adults and children clinically and psychologically
6336984 research like this is needed to measure how much of an impact this tailored treatment could have
6336985 research like this is vital if we are to measure the impact of changes to the way teenagers with cancer are treated recruiting more young people onto clinical trials which has been a priority for childhood cancer will help this
6336986 there is still much to be done to ensure teenagers have as good a chance of survival as any other age group and are recognised as a distinct group with particular needs

6336990 we show teachers how to use low tech materials to illustrate classic principles of science and math
6336991 ninety per cent of the work is convincing people that the eyes are real
6336992 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
6336993 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6336994 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile
6336995 there came a point where animators were trying to create a face and there was a theory of diminishing returns

6337002 this isnt hard hadyn some big birds dive bombed us they dropped these cool tubes it makes no sense its awesome totally factor 10 cool
6337003 maybe theyre some sort of carrier pigeon but do carrier pigeons even fly anymore
6337004 only on gilligans island tv land listen to me youre just guessing
6337005 obviously they are what if they need to carry these things farther still what if theyre just resting what if they are trained to do this when they need to rest drop their packages find a hole rest then grab their stuff and carry on
6337006 so are you suggesting we flush them out cause there is no way im going to crawl back there they can get out later on their own

6337016 nothing about us needing to explain to someone why where to and for how long the black sea fleet ships are leaving their walls
6337017 without a doubt there wont be any mine fences or military collisions one shouldnt even talk about that
6337018 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
6337019 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6337020 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6337021 as a result of todays talks at acas between the unions and swissport we have a new improved offer to put to our members
6337022 because of the improved offer all planned industrial action is suspended until we get the reaction of the members
6337023 this does not affect the industrial action for the scanner workers who are employed by airport services
6337024 i think there is still a lot of fear in the market in terms of the financial sector

6337032 if you confess with your lips that jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved
6337033 no one can say jesus is lord except by the holy spirit
6337034 the instruction does not target biblical translation per se only liturgical use
6337035 although the lectionary is based on the jerusalem bible the readings printed out in lectionaries and missals use the convention of replacing the divine name with lord
6337036 this can only mean the process of translating the bible that happens prior to liturgical usage
6337037 without omissions or additions with regard to the contents and without introducing explanatory glosses or paraphrases which do not belong to the sacred text itself
6337038 the clear goal of this interconfessional effort is to produce editions of the holy scriptures which provide all speakers of the language with a common text
6337039 it is time those of us who had been sitting on the fence and complaining about the politics in this country realize that that has not brought us any dividend we therefore have to take active part in effecting all the changes we as professionals deem necessary for national development making ghanaians aware that politics is not a do or die affair

6337073 what is particularly striking about the entire approach in the gcse game is just how anti education it is
6337074 the value of participating in a course is insignificant compared to the grade the pupil gains at the end of the course thats why lower performers are being encouraged to do pointless vocational courses

6337138 but it turns out pollution in southern greenland was higher 100 years ago when north american and european economies ran on coal before the advent of cleaner more efficient coal burning technologies and the switch to oil and gas based economies

6337149 these criminals and thugs must be stopped and the united states will continue working with algeria in close cooperation on counterterrorism measures

6337259 we realize the county will be in a difficult position to fund budgets this coming year so the budget we put together will be cognizant that things will be different
6337260 i think its important for all county organizations to look at the way they operate and try to increase their efficiencies and save money wherever possible
6337261 every year that i have been on the board i have received large numbers of calls from parents begging for additional staff
6337262 this is usually the case the first day or first week of school it has been limited to one or two schools this year will be different
6337263 you never know how youre going to travel with someone
6337264 we might not like each other when we get there
6337265 we have to focus on the academic achievement of all of our students
6337266 one of superintendent kevin maxwells slogans is going from good to great and we arent going to get to great if we focus only on proficient
6337267 the students who are proficient we want to make them advanced and the students who are advanced we want them to maintain that level
6337268 going to need a lot more phonics and word work than their more affluent counterparts
6337269 you dont need to do anything special they just need a lot more of it they need more support they need more practice
6337270 dont get me started on the mozzarella stick she said
6337271 deze nieuwe groene controller biedt een verbeterde werking van het d pad dat zeker zal bijdragen aan de ervaring van het spelen van games waarbij het d pad een primaire besturingsfunctie heeft
6337272 we zijn altijd op zoek naar een manier om onze producten te verbeteren en deze aanpassingen hebben we gemaakt naar aanleiding van feedback die we kregen van de gamers
6337273 wow a vampire could totally fall in love with her
6337274 well weve established that the vanagon isnt exactly a race car
6337275 ruby dont drive your air cooled vanagon westfalia to town
6337276 id investigate whether a porsche or subaru boxer engine might fit
6337277 i mean how cool is it when your everyday transportation can double as an apartment
6337278 there is already a glut of sources for this information in the broadcast marketplace
6337279 we do object however to the cellular operators out bidding the broadcasters for sports rights and then becoming barbarian gate keepers to programming
6337280 cellular spectrum should be reserved for the two way communication for which it is designed
6337281 one way transmission of news sports weather and traffic would be a misuse of this spectrum and a needless duplication of broadcast services
6337282 les secteurs qui contribuent le plus cette hausse sont les services aux entreprises les services aux particuliers l ducation la sant et laction sociale
6337283 were out on our own not with our parents anymore no one can tell us what to do
6337284 we just want them to get a jump start on academics
6337285 it gives them a little independence a nice transition from the high school setting they like making friends ahead of time getting to know campus before everyone gets here
6337286 the time management part was what i had to adjust to
6337287 not having my mom here to stay on top of me make sure im doing my work having to take responsibility to manage my own actions make sure im spending my time wisely i like it
6337288 its something i knew i needed to do for a while
6337289 it sounded like a great idea to kind of introduce you to the college course load it also gets three credits out of the way so im taking one less course first semester i can get used to balancing all my classes
6337290 there are not all these rules everyone assumes everyone else is mature theres more discussion you dont have to raise your hand its just more fun
6337291 when you finish studying evening rolls around were like what do we do now
6337292 at home my room was always a mess but here i try to keep it clean people are always in here and its hard to find stuff in such a small space
6337293 we had great response to our call for applications and have been able to assemble a respected group of individuals to serve on the council
6337294 ultimately our aim is to ensure we have strong representation from across the province from employers and organized labour and that we will hear and learn from individuals who know first hand what its like to settle and succeed in nova scotia
6337295 its a busy and exciting time with lots of unknowns
6337296 but we believe this is a good time to introduce our area and we are finding a lot of interest
6337297 well love to have the big companies come in but its likely to be the risk takers that get here first and hopefully show the others
6337298 we want to attract international investors and we do not have plans to build a national oil group
6337299 the geology of the jan mayen ridge area is related to what we have off eastern greenland where hydrocarbons have been found
6337300 this is the type of community effort that has always made calvert county a great place to live
6337301 its neighbor helping neighbor im proud to be a part of the end hunger in calvert county project
6337302 the response already has been so amazing were working hard just to keep up with all the people who want to be a part of this
6337303 i am jealous of you and i cant help that
6337304 it was certainly something that was meant to be hid away from other people
6337305 thats not a letter a babysitter would give a child

6337307 im very hopeful that within the month well be seeing a cheque come forward
6337308 its kind of an old stale disease and everyones kind of accepted the fact that you know somebody that has cancer that dies
6337309 cancer one day will be something that our grandkids talk about
6337310 ultimately the biggest breakthroughs and discoveries in the 21st century around this disease are going to be things that are actually common throughout all types of cancer
6337311 he dealt with exactly the same things that everybody that gets cancer does
6337312 they think if he did that and went there maybe i could just get back to work
6337313 the only greater experience is when i kiss my wife
6337314 getting to keep the stanley cup would be my best birthday present ever
6337315 youre around the people that you care about an awful lot your family and friends and lots of friends in the community players that i played with back in the day when i was a junior bulldog it also feels really good to be able to bring the stanley cup home and very satisfying
6337316 we havent always with our travels been able to have good birthday parties but i think yesterday was a pretty good one
6337317 one of the biggest events to hit what we consider one of the greatest hockey towns in nova scotia
6337318 its a great hockey town they love their hockey theyre great supporters of the game of hockey this is just another indication of it here today
6337319 sharon and i havent been in one place for three years
6337320 so were pretty excited about the opportunity to spend six years in detroit we have a very good team
6337321 well im not sure if its 800 pounds 600 pounds maybe
6337322 i want to make sure we talk about the positive things that are going on in cape breton
6337323 youre taking a look at a building thats full of flammable combustibles its a high hazard industry
6337324 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6337325 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people
6337326 the average household has its tv on for eight hours and 14 minutes daily thats a record
6337327 they build this and of course americans love piers with amusement rides they love fun and now its a draw
6337328 it is very important that we ensure the public has a reasonable amount of time to provide input on our proposed changes to school board governance
6337329 because of vacations and summer schedules we decided our deadline may be difficult for some groups and individuals to meet
6337330 a week is better than nothing but is getting a week extension long enough no
6337331 we knew from the outset that the timeline was going to be really tight
6337332 we determined that we could add another 11 days to consultation and still meet our own deadline of getting the ministers response out to the public by sept 9 which is the day that the nominations close
6337333 barring finding mr sperry ultimately this turns into a passive search where we distribute photos contact the media and then it becomes a missing persons file
6337334 and theres nothing to indicate any other rationale for the disappearance of mr sperry
6337335 its been a huge effort on behalf of the community just unbelievable
6337336 i just would like to help out with the search or cooking just in some way
6337337 the public response to this has been overwhelming and shes not the first who was turned away
6337338 but all the needs are being met and they just cant accommodate any more people
6337339 when i was a kid yeah i absolutely wanted one
6337340 never did get it too expensive and that was that but now it looks like im getting a second chance
6337341 that has appeal from a personal point of view of course
6337342 but also it lets you do things that you wouldnt be able to do otherwise you can dare to be a little bit bolder and fly a little closer to the action and if something were to happen to it of course its a shame but its not tragic
6337343 theres a huge difference in size the auroras over 100 feet long and fully loaded weighs about 70 tonnes
6337344 the new unmanned aerial vehicle is more the size of a cessna or something along those lines its pretty tiny
6337345 since then ive been flying a desk at wing ops
6337346 if i got into a plane id certainly feel rusty
6337347 i think the unmanned aerial vehicle world may be different enough from flying manned aircraft that i wont notice the rust so much
6337348 i hope well be able to help out the army because thats really what the scope of the mission is all about
6337349 you get the view of whats going on on the ground so its possible to see things that wouldnt be seen from ground level because of obstacles and hills
6337350 that will give us a chance to not only operate the vehicle in flight but also to co operate with the army because thats the main thrust of the job
6337351 so with a few of them you could get round the clock coverage
6337352 there will also be one person from the intelligence section watching because they would be the experts on interpreting what you see
6337353 we are frustrated that our athletes and the boxing coaching team will have to deal with this added pressure and distraction at this point in the games nobody involved with boxing should be distracting the team at this time
6337354 right now i have three boxers who are fighting to win gold medals for team gb and i will not allow anything to distract my lads from what they need to do in the ring
6337355 it is my hope that reading these stories inspires some to plant their own seeds of change that when we see something wrong well do something about it whether that means writing to your representative in congress or researching a cure for a disease or simply speaking out against inequality and prejudice were all in this together and the first step toward change can begin with any one of us
6337356 i was in a mall a few days before july 1 and unbelievably i saw a sign stating end of season sale before wed had one decent summer day before the first of july it was the end of season and time to bring in fall and winter
6337357 a tribute to all the great people in history that had mustaches guys like tom selleck and chuck norris and jesus and ron burgundy

6337359 i was watching ping pong on msnbc in the olympics and they showed this ad for this tv show which was going to be about abe lincoln and czar nicholas who was the last czar of russia
6337360 so anyway czar nicholas had this look so i was laying in bed i go thats a sweet look so i got up about 10 30 at night i shaved my chin and said hey if the czar can do it i can do it

6337362 two of the silliest pieces i have read on ya literature in ages
6337363 heres an idea why doesnt everyone just grow up and stop talking about this and let teens read what they want whether a publisher designates it ya or not
6337364 i really have a problem with this book it shouldnt be on the shortlist let alone win
6337365 college guys talk about what theyre reading what they read in high school and what books are important to them now
6337366 with me as president we will decide and fight together and if necessary we will die together a division of labor in which americans fight and euopeans are responsible for the rebuilding will no longer work out
6337367 i cannot tell you how much this mentality goes on my nerves this form of cheap criticism of the us by europeans only to later jump on the footboard and let americans give them a ride in security political matters we keep criticizing the us but we do little if anything to develop european power we are not willing take on more responsibility and accept more risks in order to do that we criticize from the armchair while we know that if things get serious the big brother on the other side of the atlantic will help us it really sticks in my craw so i understand american criticism and i am impressed that it doesnt make more of them despise the europeans

6337393 what we need to do if we want to win medals in olympics
6337394 years ago we inherited countless millions of dollars from our great great grandfather alexander we invested this money and over the years the value grew and grew
6337395 we divided it into eight trust funds one for ma bell the affectionate nickname your dad calls your mom and one for each of you
6337396 though we love each of you pa and i decided we want a life of our own we are taking ours and heading for glory since we are the parents we picked what we liked the best no worries though all eight are good and we tried our best to make each one equally as interesting
6337397 well all seven trusts are equally as valuable more or less we decided to let each sibling pick the one they want starting with nynex which was nancy nicholes nickname though no one could recall how nancy nichole was shortened to nynex

6337399 all worship is an intelligent and loving response to the revelation of god because it is the adoration of his name therefore acceptable worship is impossible without preaching for preaching is making known the name of the lord and worship is praising the name of the lord made known far from being an alien intrusion into worship the reading and preaching of the word are actually indispensable to it the two cannot be divorced indeed it is their unnatural divorce which account for the low level of so much contemporary worship our worship is poor because our knowledge of god is poor and our knowledge of god is poor because our preaching is poor but when the word of god is expounded in its fullness and the congregation begin to glimpse the glory of the living god they bow down in solemn awe and joyful wonder before his throne it is preaching which accomplishes this the proclamation of the word of god in the power of the spirit of god

6337403 memang sukuk tidak hanya untuk investasi tapi juga harus dapat diperdagangan agar pasarnya berkembang kalau pasar sukuk bisa berkembang menjadi likuid aktif dan deep maka kapasitas daya serapnya semakin besar dan biaya penerbitan sukuk menjadi lebih rendah
6337404 saya mendengar laporan bahwa masih ada bank yang tidak mau beli karena internal audit mereka tidak memperbolehkan sampai pbi benar benar dicabut ini tidak benar karena statement yang dibuat bu fadjriah sebagai deputi gbi sudah cukup sementara proses pencabutan sedang dilakukan tegasnya
6337405 jadi kalau suatu saat mereka membutuhkan likuidtas mereka tidak bisa menjual sukuknya kalau memang demikian susah untuk pemerintah mengembangkan sukuk sbsn padahal pemerintah terus membutuhkan dana yang semakin besar ke depan
6337406 russias president dmitri medvedev called prime minister ehud olmert on wednesday evening the two discussed in length several regional and bilateral issues
6337407 probably you may say that there was no expectation from the people back home and the media too but me and my coach satpal always knew i had a fair chance of winning a medal and im happy i could achieve that
6337408 while it is good not to have that burden of expectation on your shoulder i think we can give even more provided we get better facilities i want to dedicate this medal to my coach satpal
6337409 it was not easy out there i had to compete in four bouts today which did make me weary towards the end i had not played against doug schwab usa and albert batyrov belarus earlier so they were unknown rivals for me but once i got past them and had leonid spiridinov kazakhstan against me i sensed my chance i said to myself i cannot let it go after coming so close to a medal and if i was tired so was he
6337410 most of the times we have played in sri lanka it is not a bowlers paradise especially for the fast bowlers full credit to the fast bowlers for coming out with flying colours in tough conditions they bowled in right areas
6337411 in the last two games seamers got help but they may not get these conditions in the coming three games it was turning a bit also so it was a bit tough when in one end we had a batsman but in other end it was open with the tailenders of course it was a concerned area till the match got over

6337429 we have been informed by the hong kong authorities that mr gadd was denied entry to hong kong and has returned to bangkok
6337430 mr gadd was in contact with us seeking consular assistance
6337431 he must definitely be coming back to bangkok since hong kong refused to let him in
6337432 we will have to expel him either back to vietnam or britain or another country where he wants to go
6337433 i dont know his arrival time or flight number but i think he will land mid afternoon because his name was not on any of the passenger lists this morning

6337438 our goal in this new release was to bring the conversion power of icosales lead management to a variety of sales organizations
6337439 the perspective of the kaleidico brand has long been as an innovator in building crm software that helps sales people increase their closing capacity now we have handed this advantage to any sales team
6337440 this release has given kaleidico the opportunity to work with a whole range of new clients
6337441 i am personally amazed by the passion coming out of several new non profit and political campaign management clients these are clients flush with energy for their causes and icosales helps them raise their volume

6337444 despite the recent dip in gas prices significant auto rebates still exist on many larger vehicles the nissan armada beat the toyota land cruiser on the strength of a 5 000 rebate and the nissan quest
6337445 an interesting fact is nissan has quietly mentioned that the armada may not continue production after early 2010 that is an indication of the new reality of this market and it bell also noted that intellichoice com

6337447 the chevy silverado has been a solid presence on the best deals
6337448 however we expect to see the close outs of the 2008 dodge ram and 2008 ford f150 impact these classes as their all new 2009 models roll into the market later this year
6337449 intellichoice com best deal of the month www intellichoice com for more information or to check the auto rebate section of any vehicle report for the most up to date incentives
6337450 if terria wins the bid the very first thing i will do is contact telstra chairman donald mcgauchie or telstra ceo sol trujillo and offer them an equity shareholding in our company
6337451 the only reason i would do that is because we want the network to service the whole of the industry on equal terms and i think telstra investing as an equity owner would give the assurance that the network was being operated fairly
6337452 under our bid the major equity owner would be the commonwealth government we will then fund the build with a mix of equity investment and debt after that it will just be a matter of working out what the most efficient capital structure is
6337453 terria would give telstra as big a share as they wanted so long as they wont be able to control the consortium
6337454 telstra would be like any other equity owner in the consortium who has an interest in making sure the network was properly run but not able to influence the outcomes in their favour or to a disadvantage to the other equity holders
6337455 if the business case of this 8 shelf company terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board
6337456 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6337457 telstra invests in networks like next g and next ip while terria invests in airport billboards telstra has made absolutely clear that if it builds the nbn it will provide open and equivalent access to everyone
6337458 the nbn project marks the biggest infrastructure investment in the countrys history it has enormous potential to benefit the nation if it enhances competition but if it shuts down competition which it could to do then it has enormous potential to be a disaster
6337459 we believe particularly because there is so much taxpayer money in this project that the first areas to be serviced should be those that are currently underserviced

6337466 ive always wanted a bike like that perhaps not one that turns onlookers minds into a gelatin like slurry but a surrealist bicycle because if you think about it there is something inherently weird about the bicycle with its chittering gears bristling spokes and spinning chains there is something insect like about its workings a mental connection evoked by its best synonym velocipede a synonym which seems to share both etymologic and entomologic phylum with the centipede im not the only one to be fascinated by the bikes innate oddity bicycles are often used in art as symbols of the inherently absurd childrens books are filled with magic or living bikes and the penny farthing is such a marvelously implausible method of transportation that it is constantly used as the butt of jokes in television shows the penny farthing was also the logo of patrick mcgoohans hallucinatory sci fi spy series the prisoner the bike by itself was a symbol of the surrealness to come there are few pleasures in life purer than bicycling around on a bright brisk day this is because bikes are already just wonderfully odd inventions making a bike even stranger is less an act of mechanical eccentricity than an attempt to pass the pleasure of riding one to the people you cycle past emphasizing to them what they forgot the bicycles marvelous strangeness

6337516 we are here to take up the fight against russia
6337517 contrary to the official version presented by prime minister tusk and the us state department the war in georgia played a key role in accelerating the polish american negotiations on the defence shield it is the war that has prompted tusk to give the go ahead for the signing of the agreement
6337518 the fact that the us ruled out this compromise proposal permits only one conclusion that the missile shield is directed first and foremost not against iran but against russia this is underlined by the fact that the other bases for the missile system are also located in border regions to russia for example alaska
6337519 the strategic significance of the system consists of intercepting those few dozen missiles moscow is capable of launching following an american first strike
6337520 the missile system is therefore a crucial element in the attempt to develop a nuclear first strike capacity against russia the original plan is for the stationing of just ten interceptor missiles in poland but once the system is established their number could be easily increased
6337521 this article makes very clear the actual function of the missile system it is to guarantee the us the capacity to carry out nuclear war without the risk of a counter strike if this capacity can be achieved then it can be employed as a geopolitical argument in order to implement national interests

6337539 despite a positive start to 2008 the more uncertain macroeconomic environment has resulted in trading conditions for some of our brands becoming more challenging in the uk
6337540 this has been particularly true of the investment banking market which accounted for approximately 20 of group net fee income in 2007
6337541 been mitigated to an extent by price increases and cost reduction
6337542 the second half has started very well for the group and we have some exciting new releases ahead of us in the remainder of the year and beyond
6337543 during the second half of 2008 we expect to strengthen further our position through the finalising of two additional wafer supply agreements such that sales of more than 95 of currently planned wafer output will be contracted until end 2010
6337544 consequently we believe that the group is well placed to continue to play a significant role in the pv industry and look forward to the future with confidence

6337549 you have putins war and it seemed for a moment you had medvedevs peace
6337550 president medvedev at one point just a few weeks ago laid out a very hopeful vision for russias interaction with the rest of the world one in which russia would be respected and accepted for its commerce and its technology and its scientific prowess and its culture
6337551 and to instead have activities that hearken back to another time when all that the soviet union had was its military power its really a sad state of affairs for russia
6337552 he clearly as far as im concerned has the upper hand right now
6337553 there had been a lot of signals from putin that he was going to allow power to stay with the president that medvedev would be in charge would be the person responsible for leading russia going forward
6337554 steps hes taken in the transition from president to prime minister and in recent weeks and now certainly in georgia at least in my opinion bespeak more of putin having his hand on the steering wheel than anybody else

6337593 i think you need to play in the preseason especially the cornerbacks
6337594 there is nothing like going out there and covering guys in game situations hopefully chris and samari will get some reps
6337595 we wont have everybody because we wont have ed but we might have some of the other regulars they have been working hard so well wait and see what trainer bill tessendorf decides the good news is that they have been working
6337596 having them back doesnt change what we do or what we have done so far
6337597 its preseason obviously you dont run everything but they do need to work so far samari has been flying around all over the place and chris looks good too
6337598 we had done a great job of communicating up until that point even on the practice field
6337599 on that touchdown we had two plays called half the guys were playing cover 1 and the other half were playing two man on that touchdown fabian washington thought we had a trap on so he came off looking for the trap and there was no one on top
6337600 weve had trouble with it even in practice you can make a mistake in preseason and live with it in the regular season because the skill level is so good you cant have that kind of mistake on the back end
6337601 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6337602 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6337603 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6337604 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6337605 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it
6337606 every day truck drivers gamble with death or serious injury when they go over level crossings with badly placed stop signs and inadequate sighting distances he said
6337607 i am genuinely concerned i think australians are beginning to feel genuinely concerned that less than 12 months after the last election they are going backwards in net terms
6337608 the film will be an out and out comic entertainer and will suit venkateshs body language very well the costumes designed for venkatesh would definitely attract the youth recently we shot some scenes on the vizag beach but for a small talkie part and canning of two songs the shooting of the film is almost complete
6337609 sometimes its destiny but at least i wasnt sent to acting classes by aamir when he had selected me like he sent jiah he was confident about my acting skills
6337610 our unit is leaving for switzerland to choreograph the rest of the songs with which we will wrap up the shooting we are sure that the film will attract both the youth and the mass audiences equally
6337611 while these case studies have focused on 14 businesses there can be no doubt these outcomes would also apply more broadly across the relevant industry sectors
6337612 the bca believes the government is moving in the right direction in responding to climate change but an emissions reduction scheme must recognise business reality if it is to encourage the investment required to reduce emissions and maintain a healthy economy
6337613 if we design a scheme that makes businesses unviable the end result will be relocation of vital export earning industries to other countries this will cost australian jobs without any reduction in global emissions
6337614 we have to be very conscious that any decision to shield one sector or increase the protection to one sector will inevitably place greater costs on other parts of the community and other parts of the economy
6337615 the comedy track picturised on babu mohan anant and chittibabu would remain highlight

6337667 abang sini bagi tahu kawan kawan yang lain kita nak buat mesyuarat persatuan petang lusa kat surau
6337668 ok saja maafkan abang sebab tak dapat cakap panjang abang ada kerja ni
6337669 aah banyak perkara yang ada padanya membuatkan saya jatuh hati
6337670 abang tak nak mengikat ilah dengan sebarang janji ilah bebas menentukan arah hidup dan pilihan ilah
6337671 sekiranya ada orang datang meminang ilah dan keluarga berkenan serta bersetuju maka abang rela dan redha melepaskan ilah abang akan sentiasa mendoakan kebahagiaan ilah cuma ilah perlu memberitahu abang saja agar abang tidak berharap
6337672 kalau sesuatu itu telah ditakdirkan allah milik kita walau ia berada di seberang laut dan dalam keadaan merangkak sekalipun ia akan tetap datang ke pangkuan kita namun sekiranya sesuatu itu telah ditakdirkan bukan milik kita walaupun telah kita kunyah dan telan namun ia tetap akan dimuntahkan juga
6337673 hai ilah engkau nampak rapat saja dengan abang shidi tu ada apa apa ke
6337674 ish engkau ni saya biasa saja tak ada apa apa pun macam engkau dengan dia juga
6337675 takkanlah dia nak pilih orang macam saya sedangkan kat kampus dia tu ramai lagi yang lebih baik dari saya
6337676 engkau mana tahu hati orang lagipun saya tengok dia tu macam suka saja kat engkau
6337677 engkau orang ni jangan pandai pandai pulak nak mereka reka cerita kan susah pulak saya nanti
6337678 tanpa iman yang kukuh dan persediaan ilmu orang islam akan hanyut dalam arus kemodenan yang telah ditaja barat dengan membelakangkan agama pada pendapat mereka dengan berpegang pada agama ia akan menghalang penganutnya dari mencapai kemajuan dan kemodenan
6337679 telah banyak bukti bukti yang ditunjukkan allah bagaimana kesan dan kesudahannya kemodenan yang membelakangkan agama contohnya barat sendiri dalam mengejar arus kemodenan kita boleh lihat berapa ramai para remaja perempuan mereka yang melahirkan anak anak diluar nikah semakin maju kehidupan mereka semakin banyak jenayah yang berlaku dan semakin hebat perancangannya semakin maju dan canggih peralatan semakin singkat cara berpakaian mereka sehingga mereka tanpa segan silu mendedahkan tempat tempat yang tidak sepatutnya didedahkan kepada orang ramai
6337680 hari ini perkara sebegini telah menular ke dalam masyarakat kita anak anak kita bebas berpakaian yang kononnya up to date atau mengikut arus semasa mereka juga bebas memilih pasangan mereka serta tanpa rasa takut melakukan perkara perkara yang selayaknya dilakukan oleh sepasang suami isteri di atas nama kekasih bagi mereka itulah sebenarnya kemodenan ibu bapa pula telah hilang peranan dan hak hak mereka untuk mendidik anak anak mereka mereka hanya mampu melihat sahaja apa yang berlaku
6337681 oleh itu setiap kita mempunyai tanggungjawab yang besar untuk dimainkan bagi memastikan perkara ini tidak berlaku kita perlu sama sama mencegahnya supaya apabila ia berlaku kita tidak akan saling menunding jari untuk meletakkan kesalahan itu di atas bahu dan kepala orang lain semoga allah s w t membantu kita dalam menegakkan agamanya yang suci ini daripada terus dicemari oleh perkara perkara yang menjijikkan itu
6337682 ilah pun macam tu juga tapi nak buat macam mana nak jumpa selalu tak boleh sabar sajalah
6337683 kalau tidak kerana janji dan cita cita dah lama abang masuk pinang ilah kita kahwin lagi baik daripada terus dalam keadaan begini
6337684 ilah perempuan abang lelaki lelaki punyai lebih banyak tanggungjawab terhadap keluarga yang perlu diselesaikan terlebih dahulu sebelum dia mendirikan rumah tangga
6337685 tak mengapalah abang tunaikan dulu janji abang tu dan dapatkan dulu cita cita abang tu kalau ada jodoh kita tak ke mana juga
6337686 walau apapun ilah bebas menentukan jodoh ilah abang tak ikat dengan sebarang janji cuma hanya takdir allah adalah segala galanya
6337687 malam esok abang dah nak bertolak balik ke kampus abang ambil semester khas nak pendekkan tempoh pengajian
6337688 alaa cuti lama nanti boleh belajar masak kat rumah ni dengan makcik
6337689 ya allah saya bermohon padamu dengan seluruh kehidupan ini agar menjaga perasaan kecintaan ini kiranya dia benar benar ditakdirkan buatku maka satukanlah kami di bawah naungan cinta dan kasihmu dan jika dia ditakdirkan bukan milikku maka engkau jauhkanlah dia dari pandangan dan ingatanku perkukuhkanlah kesabaranku dalam menghadapinya dan titiplah ke dalam hatiku sifat keredhaan dengan takdirmu wahai tuhan
6337690 ya allah cubaan apakah yang engkau timpakan ini saya tidak mampu menghadapi dugaan ini tanpa bantuan dan petunjuk mu tuhan saya ini gadis yang lemah bisa tersasar dan tersesat dalam melayari cinta ya allah sekiranya ketentuan ini adalah terlebih baik buatku maka engkau tetapkanlah hati dalam menerimanya berikanlah kesabaran padaku tatkala terkenang segala pengalaman yang lalu ya allah saya menyerahkan segala ketentuan hidupku ini di tangan mu wahai tuhan yang mengetahui segala bicara hati ini
6337691 keputusan terletak sepenuhnya di tangan ilah sebarang keputusan yang ilah buat abang tetap menyokongnya
6337692 abang pernah beritahu yang abang tak pernah ikat ilah dengan sebarang janji hanya takdir allah yang menentukan segalanya ilah bebas memilih sesiapa sahaja lelaki yang bakal menjadi teman hidup ilah abang rela dan redha dengan pilihan ilah asalkan ilah bahagia dan lakukannya dengan sepenuh hati dan kesedaran ilah
6337693 cubalah abang fahami keadaan ilah sekarang ni ilah tersepit tau
6337694 abang faham abang faham sayang abang juga sepertimu sekarang ini tapi kepentingan dan kebahagiaanmu itu terlebih pentingnya bagi abang daripada kegembiraan hati abang sendiri abang tidak mampu untuk mengikatmu kerana cita cita yang masih lagi tersisa
6337695 ilah tak mampu bang ilah tak mampu cinta abang telah lama bersemi di jiwa ini mana mungkin ilah membelakanginya
6337696 baiklah kiranya itu yang membuatkan ilah tersepit kini abang lepaskan ilah dari cinta abang
6337697 boleh jadi kamu benci kepada sesuatu padahal ia baik bagi kamu dan boleh jadi kamu suka kepada sesuatu padahal ia buruk bagi kamu dan ingatlah allah jualah yang mengetahui semuanya itu sedang kamu tidak mengetahuinya
6337698 tidak sekali kali akan menimpa kami sesuatu pun melainkan apa yang telah ditetapkan allah bagi kami dia lah pelindung yang menyelamatkan kami dan dengan kepercayaan itu maka kepada allah jualah hendaknya orang orang yang beriman bertawakal
6337699 selamat pengantin baru semoga berbahagia selalu dan berkekalan hingga ke anak cucu
6337700 ini untukmu sahabat tanda kenangan dariku dan saya serahkan kekasih hatiku ini kepangkuan jagaanmu dengan rela hati dan doa yang berkekalan
6337701 pada hari ini dengan ikhlas hati abang serahkanmu kepangkuan suamimu yang abang hormati tiada yang lebih manis dan indah dalam hidup ini melainkan sewaktu abang bahagia bersama cintamu namun ketahuilah olehmu bahawa abang tidak mampu untuk menanggung cinta sucimu itu dan terus membawanya ke gerbang bahagia sebagaimana dirimu alami pada hari ini hari ini putus sudah cinta kita sebagai pasangan kekasih dan yang kekal hanyalah kasih dan sayang abang seperti saudara kandungmu sendiri
6337702 maka abang harap dirimu mampu membahagiakan suamimu ini sebagaimana abang telah bahagia dengan cintamu suatu ketika dahulu cintailah dia seadanya kerana dialah segala galanya selepas tuhan dan rasul ikutanmu abang doakan dirimu bahagia di sampingnya seorang lelaki yang kini bergelar suami buatmu
6337703 usahlah dirimu menangis di hari berbahagia ini senyumlah tanda kesyukuran kerana dikurniakan tuhan seorang lelaki yang terlebih baik untuk menggantikan tempat abang dalam hidup mu
6337704 dia lakukan semuanya ini adalah untuk kebahagian ilah bukan untuknya dia menderita kerana memilih jalan ini tapi kerana ilah dia sanggup lakukannya
6337705 sebenarnya dia tidak mahu ilah menjadi janda dalam usia yang masih muda
6337706 dia mengidapi penyakit yang sudah kronik dia tidak mahu ilah menanggung kesusahan kerananya
6337707 ya allah ringankanlah penderitaannya dan jemputlah dia dalam keadaan engkau meredhai dan merinduinya
6337708 ya allah gagahkanlah hatiku ini untuk menerima cubaan mu dan tetapkanlah kesabaran dalam menghadapi saat ini serta titipkanlah keredhaan dalam hatiku untuk menerima takdir mu
6337709 ya allah rahmatilah rohnya dan tempatkannya bersama orang orang soleh berikanlah dia keutamaan di sisimu sebagai seorang yang banyak berjasa kepada agama mu
6337710 fitnatul wahhabiyyah an essay about the wahhabi crimes against islam and against muslims
6337711 to call upon the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam when performing tawassul by the prophet is shirk
6337712 he will be misguided and he will misguide those for whom allah willed the misguidance
6337713 the muslim who asks help from the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam other prophets or the righteous people salihun or who calls or asks any of them for intercession is like those blasphemers mentioned in the quran
6337714 those who perform tawassul asking allah by the prophets for example are similar to those blasphemers mentioned in surat az zumar ayah 3 who claim they do not worship the idols except to achieve a higher status from allah
6337715 the blasphemers did not believe the idols create anything they believed allah is the creator
6337716 what i fear most for my nation is a man who mis explains the quran and takes it out of context
6337717 o allah i ask you by the status of those who ask you
6337718 without doubt this is tawassul the prophet sallallahu alayhi wa sallam used to teach this supplication dua to his companions and order them to say it this issue was expounded upon in different books and treatises refuting ibn abdul wahhab
6337719 o allah by the dignity of this son who will respond to him
6337720 if one of you lost something or needs help while in an open land then let him say
6337721 rescue me because allah has created slaves whom you do not see
6337722 on the day of judgment i will intercede for the one who visits my grave with the good intention
6337723 dan masa kejayaan dan kehancuran itu kami pergilirkan di antara manusia agar mereka mendapat pelajaran
6337724 sesungguhnya engkau dapati yang paling keras memusuhi orang orang yang beriman ialah orang orang yahudi dan orang orang yang mempersekutukan tuhan
6337725 dan telah kami buat keputusan untuk bani israel di dalam kitab sesungguhnya kamu akan membuat bencana di muka bumi dua kali dan kamu menyombongkan diri dengan kesombongan yang besar
6337726 sehingga mereka merasakan akibat yang buruk dari perbuatannya dan akibat perbuatan mereka itu adalah kerugian yang besar

6337762 the surplus is slightly bigger than expected but the key thing is that the deteriorating trend in public borrowing is stark
6337763 the full year figures are going to be significantly worse than the chancellors forecast of 43bn
6337764 easily reach 50bn or more this year even before considering any possible spending overshoot which seems quite likely in areas like debt interest and social security benefits that are less readily controllable by the treasury
6337765 these dreadful figures show that borrowing is out of control one test of a fair society is that we do not leave our children to pay our debts and this fiscal irresponsibility is not just reckless it is deeply unfair on future generations

6337771 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
6337772 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
6337773 while hype may not generate large box office receipts it is sure to become another prong in the right wing attack machine
6337774 citizens united head david bossie might be hopeful that as the campaign moves forward some right wing websites might offer the film as a premium as they have for the books
6337775 in order to get regular voters to go see the movie it will have to garner media buzz on the cable television news networks like the anti obama books have
6337776 looking at both the television advertisement for the film and its five minute trailer its clear that neither bossie nor alan peterson the films director have chops theyre no michael moore
6337777 another rich liberal elitist from massachusetts who claims hes a man of the people priceless

6337779 fahrenheit 911 recognises that the film will likely have a very limited if any run in theaters and he intends to market it via mail order sales on the citizen united website and through other dvd outlets
6337780 bossie is a political hatchet man whose career is based on smears and attacking democrats
6337781 his obama documentary will provide plenty of footage for use on the internet and in commercials but i doubt that in and of itself that
6337782 i assume that the overall theme of obama as socialist agent disguised as cult hero must be resonating in the political marketing surveys of the bossie types and the mccain operatives or they would switch to something more effective
6337783 going back to the days when he was unremitting in his attacks against bill and hillary clinton bossies forte has never been accuracy
6337784 it has been bloodletting and in that regard if hype gets any traction at all it is likely to be viewed as the political counterpart of the horror movie franchise saw v due to be released just before the election
6337785 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
6337786 life is 10 what happens to you and 90 how you react to it
6337787 when i hear somebody sigh life is hard i am always tempted to ask compared to what
6337788 its best to keep your troubles pretty much to yourself cause half the people youd tell em to wont give a damm and the other half will be glad to hear you got em
6337789 i think he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters
6337790 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6337791 i would love him to show more respect for his competitors thats not the way we perceive being a champion but he will learn in time he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them hell learn that sooner or later but hes a great athlete of course
6337792 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals of course owens had the long jump too so you cant compare people if he maintains that in the future bolt will be someone that probably leaves a mark like jesse owens
6337793 i just had a lot of carbs for breakfast its just what do they call it a breakfast pouch bunch
6337794 to be honest with you i dont know how to explain it
6337795 at first my boyfriend loves kobe then i love him more than my boyfriend
6337796 most important is his faultless performance on the basketball court
6337797 what kobe has given china before this the olympics is a sign of respect as if saying youre good enough so im going to keep coming here he has showed them respect over the last few years and its been reciprocated at a very high level its unbelievable really
6337798 i love yao ming and kobe but i love kobe more
6337799 i began to know kobe when i saw the games of yao ming i havent heard that kobe comes to china at least once a year to do training clinics but i think chinese medicine is good for a player you see yao ming received it and it works well
6337800 the other day it was pouring down raining and there was still a group outside of about 100 kids just waiting chasing the bus in the rain theyre dedicated
6337801 i thought i was famous until i got here with kobe
6337802 were not back in the u s right now were in china he can leave that back in the u s
6337803 youre still a laker and nationally theres always someone who wants you to lose badly in the nba 29 cities probably respect equals boo there here respect equals cheer
6337804 im just a sports junkie so for me to hop around from event to event and see so many great teams this is a once in a lifetime opportunity

6337815 152 is not a very high number when you look at other clubs coaches are near 250 and up towards 300
6337816 historically the swans whether it be sydney or south melbourne have chopped and changed a fair bit and havent had much stability
6337817 hopefully i brought that and certainly paul has as well
6337818 i think it proves that if a club is pretty stable and you give a coach a chance to develop some players it can work for you
6337819 over a period of time under rocket eade and under myself the club has been pretty successful
6337820 last week i levelled the record and this week i suspect i will break it because ive got the total support of the board at the moment unless something happens between now and saturday
6337821 its something you sit down after your career has finished and you think about it then
6337822 these athletes can speak to the young people in our more troubled communities especially since many of them come from those communities
6337823 we cant wait for them to come home as a result
6337824 good things can come out of the ghetto good things can come out of waterhouse
6337825 my mother is probably one of the biggest reasons why im running
6337826 it has a positive effect on bringing the crime rate down this is a great opportunity to sell jamaica in the positive light it deserves
6337827 this gives jamaicans a new picture to hold in their hands and look at for a moment and say to themselves you know we can do better
6337828 the whole country feels right now as if good things are happening to us for a change
6337829 they did this because they dont want us to come back
6337830 i stayed to defend our house they destroyed everything they burned our house and killed and stole our cattle
6337831 now well have to rebuild it i dont know where the money will come from to rebuild south ossetia probably from russia
6337832 we started out with over 20 knots of wind and crisp temperatures and finished up with lighter air of 8 10 knots those that persevered finished four full races and should head home pretty tired
6337833 im finding the greens a little quick and im not controlling my weight i like quick greens but i havent been on one that quick this year so i havent adjusted as much as i should but its coming around i just need to be a little more consistent
6337834 results wise it was actually quite poor for us unfortunately
6337835 we didnt come close to reaching our goal we got distracted mentally just a few days before the event and unfortunately we couldnt shake it we were just distracted throughout the entire event so it was a pretty good lesson learned
6337836 we were here but we couldnt get our coach dave hughes here for us
6337837 we couldnt get him in for accreditation with the sailing team so that was disappointing
6337838 this is my first olympics and generally you see a lot of guys get their first medal at their second olympics
6337839 but even though this was our first games it was still a poor result but i guess we learned a lot from the entire experience which will make me stronger going into the start of my training in three weeks for 2012
6337840 i have been aspiring to the world record for so long
6337841 everything came together tonight and i just blew my mind and blew the worlds mind
6337842 i am glad to know he is from jamaica and that he is supernatural
6337843 it was a much more amazing start than he got in the 100 metres and then his turn was just absolutely fabulous
6337844 really the break needs to be much longer for us to get those broken bones healed
6337845 ive never seen this many guys hurt on a team and then to still be as successful as we are right now
6337846 theyre good at stopping the run and this year theyre not giving up very much in the passing game either
6337847 we reached an agreement final decision with respect to moving ahead has not been made yet but we have an agreement with the umpires
6337848 in this particular case the rule violation was serious and was attempting to interfere with our ability to conduct an accurate post race competitive analysis
6337849 it called for a serious reaction on our part and we think the penalty speaks to that
6337850 in 17 years we have never had any representative of joe gibbs racing knowingly act outside of nascars rules and that is something we consider essential to how we operate on a daily basis
6337851 what we have determined is that these individuals involved used extremely poor judgment
6337852 i would like to apologize to the employees and partners of joe gibbs racing
6337853 because of poor decision making i have failed you as the leader of this team and i am solely responsible for this situation secondly i apologize to the men and women of nascar for my dishonesty and interference during a testing event
6337854 i accept the penalties imposed by nascar and joe gibbs racing and make no excuses
6337855 weve got to get better because you never stay the same you get better or worse
6337856 they were good last year and gave us everything we wanted last year with a backup quarterback
6337857 hes doing great wouldnt you us 60 million richer hes doing wonderful
6337858 my psyche and mentality is pretty much fixed on im the greatest race car driver to ever live
6337859 if you dont believe that you dont belong in a race car
6337860 i feel a little lonely in the decisions i have to make on many subjects at many different times
6337861 but carl demonstrated to me and as david ragan does and as matt kenseth did before him and greg biffle did that hes going to be a good in this business as anybody ive ever known
6337862 and hes going to stay there for a long time so i was right in recognizing he had potential and very quickly after he won his first race i told him ill stay in the business as long as you drive these cars i hope that ive got job security for a long time now on account of that
6337863 were getting to the point i feel personally that we can win at any racetrack we go to
6337864 our pit crew has stepped up their game that was our weakness for a long time and the guys have just repeatedly week after week worked harder and become better
6337865 im guardedly optimistic that well be able to put four cars in the chase
6337866 that wont be the same as when we put five in but carl based on the way that the structure of the chase is will be in better shape than any of the other guys can be
6337867 carl certainly is a strong favourite within my group of prospects of being able to close the deal
6337868 what i think is kind of a bummer is if i dont play well these three weeks i wont be in the tour championship
6337869 i mean ive had a great year and i think thats not right i dont think thats fair at all for me to win three times and be kicked out of the tour championship but ive kind of been kicked out of all of the tournaments anyway i won the memorial and that didnt get me in the u s open
6337870 it looks to me like what i did this whole year didnt matter and i dont think thats right
6337871 i think there should be some kind of system to where it favours the guy thats had a good year
6337872 i think it should favor the guy who has played well throughout the year but its not going to be in effect this year at all i think youll see somebody come deep and out of the pack that could actually win this thing if i understand it correctly i may not understand it correctly i dont know i really dont understand it anyway
6337873 this is my third pair of contact lenses in my left eye third one of the week and it feels real good and im seeing pretty good out of it
6337874 im excited and it doesnt hurt i dont have any pain my vision is good again
6337875 its a very long golf course its definitely going to be a week
6337876 driving it in the fairway is a premium but the driver is the strength of my game when im on with my driver i dont miss many fairways
6337877 i like westchester i think its a great golf course
6337878 i do feel as though ridgewood is a step up in quality its just a wonderful golf course ive always loved going to westchester but this course really has a major championship feel its a tillinghast same designer as winged foot same designer i believe as baltusrol very similar feel and it has that northeast major championship feel
6337879 the 18th hole doglegs right not left so thats a nice change
6337880 when i saw that he won i jumped up and hugged and kissed my son
6337881 i hope this will send a message of peace to my country after 30 years of war
6337882 i am so happy i cannot express my feelings in words
6337883 while i was watching the match i was clapping i was so happy
6337884 my training situation is a lot like the situation in my country
6337885 i was crying because i was remembering back when we were both on the afghan refugee taekwondo team in iran
6337886 it is wonderful that an afghan athlete can win a medal in the world olympics
6337887 young people should draw hope and inspiration from this olympic win
6337888 today afghanistan has demonstrated that it can and will succeed in the face of adversity with the determination commitment and hard work of its most precious resource the young people of afghanistan

6337890 results wise it was actually quite poor for us unfortunately
6337891 we didnt come close to reaching our goal we got distracted mentally just a few days before the event and unfortunately we couldnt shake it we were just distracted throughout the entire event so it was a pretty good lesson learned
6337892 we were here but we couldnt get our coach dave hughes here for us
6337893 we couldnt get him in for accreditation with the sailing team so that was disappointing
6337894 this is my first olympics and generally you see a lot of guys get their first medal at their second olympics
6337895 but even though this was our first games it was still a poor result but i guess we learned a lot from the entire experience which will make me stronger going into the start of my training in three weeks for 2012
6337896 my fan base is more personal with the records they feel like this is their music

6337913 well i have made up the account and i find that our losses are equal so we will cry quits
6337914 the only reason the project was turned down was through visual impact so we have addresses that directly
6337915 the buildings have been reduced in height by around three metres which is a significant drop in height
6337916 certainly for the straw barns that means they will be pretty much screened by the landscaping we have in mind

6337922 the defendant being deaf and needing interpreter assistance that is not available for trial
6337923 stated that she fought off the defendant and last saw him running out of the apartment through the back sliding glass door
6337924 the clothing described by the victim was similar to what the defendant was wearing
6337925 he possibly saw the defendant walking back and forth in front of his apartment
6337926 she feared the defendant had been stalking her over the last several months
6337927 law enforcement investigated the malicious mischief but at that time had been unable to obtain probable cause that the suspect had committed the crime

6337939 i wonder how much oil there is in that bottle there is a large quantity if i should sell it i could buy five sheep every year i should have lambs and before long i should own a flock then i should sell some of the sheep and be rich enough to marry a wife perhaps we might have a son and what a fine boy he would be so tall strong and obedient but if he should disobey me
6337940 i cant get into specifics other than to say it is not uncommon during a course of an investigation that a sum of money is paid for information
6337941 was attempting to make contact with an unknown party at ubc with whom he could discuss the stolen items and a possible reward for their return
6337942 right now theres a business whereby criminals are actually stealing with the hopes of being paid ransom rewards for what they steal
6337943 however when there are only dead ends in a case what do we do
6337944 it is a fact that insurance companies are often successful in negotiating the recovery of stolen art works where law enforcement agencies may not be
6337945 usually the bulk of the evidence in terms of fire cause determination actually comes from looking at the physical evidence at the scene and until we can actually pull that out with the excavation we wont have too much
6337946 the hotel is the kind of place where its very difficult to put an exact count or identification on the people that may or may not have been there
6337947 residents are often fairly transient in nature and theres not a very clear registry of who was in and who was out
6337948 he also told me that i was stupid for thinking i really knew much of anything at all since i was about 8 and only knew basic on just one microprocessor
6337949 and talk of changing the history of software development im all for progress and as a musician i understand the function of hype in generating momentum but sometimes we need to get real and be a little more harsh in our own self analysis i liked what
6337950 its before the courts and it would be inappropriate to speculate on any association between these arrests and the incident on view street
6337951 that was the project that was thought to have really brought about the demise of the early manifestation of the red scorpions
6337952 but again given the drug situation not only within the lower mainland but the province and certainly nationally we had a coalescing of people under that name and off they went again that speaks to the draw of the drug trade
6337953 as taco bell intended many customers believed that 50 cent had agreed to endorse taco bells products indeed postings on numerous internet blogs castigated 50 cent for selling out by his apparent endorsement of taco bell
6337954 when my legal team is finished with them taco bell is going to have a new corporate slogan we messed with the bull and got the horns
6337955 up until the day before we thought we were getting access to the site and had been told so by the man who owns the land
6337956 but then it was indicated to us by the bnps press office that would not be the case because we hadnt put enough comment for the bnp in our coverage
6337957 i refute that we tried to cover this event from a political standpoint straight down the middle
6337958 we came from the perspective of residents of the local area who have faced the disruption of this event
6337959 they are our readers and its they who most of our stories have concentrated around
6337960 i would much rather have the views of our readers than concern ourselves with a lot of outsiders
6337961 we had a chap who regularly walks his dog who said all the footpaths were blocked off and another family saying they couldnt get out of their front gate
6337962 a lot of clients come in with extreme food security needs
6337963 they are starving their children are starving and they need to eat right now
6337964 i was sick of listening to people moaning about their lives when they had very little to worry about
6337965 we feed anywhere from 30 to 80 people a day on a budget of 130 per week
6337966 over a year that works out at 73 cents per person per meal
6337967 because of lack of education and the way they have been brought up cleanliness is not important in a lot of the homes which means we are dealing with lice bedbugs and ongoing infections
6337968 theres lots of abuse mental physical sexual going on behind closed doors that people dont talk about and families that range from three to seven kids with parents that are very young
6337969 doing this is a fun way for me to get new ideas
6337970 diabetes is a very great problem for our elders and im trying to show them that eating healthier can taste good
6337971 its important to introduce ideas in a very basic non threatening non judgmental way often the people i work with dont have anywhere to live or are desperate to get their kids back food is pretty low down the list
6337972 we believe theres a need for an environmental emergency to be declared at this site
6337973 this problem was discovered more than five months ago and nothing has been done to effectively clean up the site
6337974 were still waiting and meanwhile salmon are coming up the river to spawn we need prompt action
6337975 this action must be taken before further damage is done to oliver creek the cowichan river and surrounding ecosystems
6337976 in this case the ministrys abdication of its public responsibility to ensure prompt and effective remediation has led to most unfortunate results
6337977 the scope of the spill is still undetermined and needs to be delineated the source of the spill may still be active and the bio cell of contaminated soil is potentially unstable and may not be fully sealed
6337978 to step in and directly co ordinate all actors at the site and ensure prompt and efficient remediation takes place before further damage is done to oliver creek the cowichan river and surrounding ecosystems
6337979 highlights the problems that arise when government privatizes environmental regulations and abdicates what is properly governmental responsibility to private parties and consultants
6337980 i want to stress that this storm is becoming a serious catastrophic flooding event
6337981 you cant grab your food you cant grab your tv grab what you can and go
6337982 that is amazing im never going to drink anything else ever again
6337983 a lot of hard work has gone into the site ahead of its launch but it has all been worth it now it is up and running
6337984 weve had a fair amount of interest in the website already and we are delighted to have parkour specialists 3run ltd on board
6337985 these guys are the best free runners in the world and have been involved in some massive projects including james bond casino royale
6337986 this is only the beginning over the next few months we aim to expand the site into the most comprehensive database of activity ideas on the internet
6337987 we are always looking for writers and photographers to contribute
6337988 unfortunately we are not yet in a position to offer payment but all work will be fully accredited and we hope to take on journalists and photographers in the future

6338017 very dance y really up tempo in the clubs real aggressive catchy and very hook friendly
6338018 im trying to reinvent her and reinvent myself with the project
6338019 many audience members found her attempt to crossover into country irritating and that her vocals lacked a southern sound
6338020 i dont know what your perception is of jessica simpson or what tabloid you buy but i just want you to know that im just a girl from texas im just like you im doing what i love and dating a boy

6338027 i didnt realise until i got to the next tee that i had peed my pants just a little bit
6338028 i will take it easy and maybe run a few races in the grand prix season that is remaining and then continue with my training i hope to make the kenyan marathon team for the 2012 olympics
6338029 i felt a sharp sensation in my stomach after i cleared the hurdle and i tried to push but i was feeling so bad and i just decided to take it easy to the finish
6338030 it the game against nigeria is the big one and we need to have everybody available
6338031 that is a huge match for us so the coach had a meeting with him mccarthy and there are no more problems everything has been sorted out and we can all move on
6338032 the coach called me and the captain mokoena into a meeting in london where he outlined his vision to the 2010 world cup
6338033 he stated very clearly that because of our football profiles and experience he expects us to lead the campaign forward
6338034 i told the coach that i will be available because i love my country and i always show that in every game i play just like tuesday night
6338035 i met the two players mccarthy and mokoena and had a man to man talk with them about my expectations of them and the leadership expected from players of their football status
6338036 our careers demand we be in different parts of the world now and in the future and the pressures associated with this have forced us to make this very difficult decision we remain committed and caring friends with love admiration and support for one another we would appreciate respect for our privacy at this time
6338037 we really dont want to make any more comment about the news which im sure you can understand but it is an emotional time which is to be expected
6338038 we were in the dressing room in la looking at some of the stuff and much of it especially some of the t shirts looked terrible
6338039 the same quality control has to extend to stuff being sold at our shows and we made that clear it has to be a no crap zone
6338040 tickets purchased through ticketmaster for the coldplay gigs at the secc have been printed on incorrect stock but we are confident that ticketmaster will be able to replace all tickets for their customers in advance of the gigs in december however it will be more difficult to replace tickets originally purchased through ticketmaster and then sold on through the secondary ticket market in this case ticket holders should contact their point of purchase we urge these secondary sources to look after their customers at this time

6338077 the soulja boy exclusive shoe will be released in the fall along with my album
6338078 the soulja boy cartoon will also be released in the fall so theres three things to look out for
6338079 the same quality control has to extend to stuff being sold at our shows and we made that clear it has to be a no crap zone
6338080 the paradigm in the music business has shifted and as an artist and a businesswoman i have to move with that shift
6338081 who knows how my albums will be distributed in the future thats whats exciting about this deal everything is possible
6338082 i was with her twice then 10 years later while i was in jail she called me and told me that her husband at the time turned up negative in the paternity test and that meant i was the father
6338083 i havent seen the woman for 13 years i believed her at first but now out of nowhere shes gone public this is a woman with a lot of issues i dont know if i can trust her
6338084 my lawyers are working on this theres going to be a paternity test
6338085 he was supposed to take a paternity test seven years ago but he disappeared off the face of the earth
6338086 are you kidding top celebrity mom look at her off screen antics her lack of morals and how she conducts herself i guess they forgot to mention how this top super mom leaves her kids alone at night and even parties in their presence just wait until we go back to court
6338087 she comes stumbling out of club butter at 3 15 a m with bloodshot eyes and a red runny nose yelling oh bleep when she saw the paparazzi
6338088 nick does whatever mariah wants him to hes like her puppy it seems like he spends more time in the stores with mariahs credit card than he does with mariah herself
6338089 mariahs assistants and friends call him whipped nick behind his back they have little respect for him because he wont stand up for himself
6338090 they were both very calm madonna told guy im sorry i want a divorce and he agreed it was quite painless but very sad
6338091 hes a bit down in the dumps and who can blame him guy is a decent bloke full stop its not his style to start profiteering from such sorry circumstances hes got too much respect for his wife and children
6338092 my husband and i are not planning on getting a divorce i know alex rodriguez through guy oseary who manages both of us i brought my kids to a yankee game i am not romantically involved in any way with alex rodriguez i have nothing to do with the state of his marriage or what spiritual path he may choose to study i have learned over the years not to take accusations and the many false reports about me very seriously i also appreciate how fiction and fact seem to be perceived as one and the same by people who read both newspapers and the internet
6338093 you didnt have to give up the farm system to go get a guy
6338094 when im on the mound i dont try to think too much about anything i dont even know what my name is all i try to do is concentrate on chris costes mitt and where i want to throw the pitch and what pitch i want to throw
6338095 its really about the equipment i really dont think its an attractive quality thats what it comes down to i dont even like my own like i really dont like it i dont like anything about it
6338096 im not having hip hop at glastonbury its wrong got no chance
6338097 glastonbury was a historic event for me im feeling the love any time you can come from where i come from and come so far to come overseas and have people embrace you the way ive been embraced thus far its just an amazing feeling
6338098 i havent spoken to him but i heard he was reaching out
6338099 for the record i iike jay z thats my opinion if it offends people dont ask me any more questions i should do these things and answer like every two bit pop star
6338100 oasis as well it doesnt matter to me i dont bear any grudge its all good i just believe in good music and bad music ive always said that you look at any interview from the beginning of time ive always stated that i dont believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it
6338101 im sorry but when someone calls you something that ignorant and that offensive you have to bash their head in with a microphone
6338102 somebody in the crowd was taunting travis with racial slurs
6338103 travis mccoy and gym class heroes are anything but violent their message is about racial unity and having a good time its amazing that in 2008 there are still people out there that would say such ignorant things travis is deeply upset that this happened and has expressed his apologies to the bands fans that were at the show tour organizer kevin lyman and the vans warped tour gch is putting this behind them and looks forward to seeing everyone on the rest of the tour
6338104 its very exciting its one big party and everyone wants to join us
6338105 he has been in the studio for months he wants to create an amazing album and wont release anything until he is totally satisfied
6338106 hes a musical genius and record bosses want to leave him to develop his magic it will be down to him when it is released
6338107 it was boring we were too guarded we werent ready im comfortable keeping all the reality in my music
6338108 its important to me that this album gets to the fans its been a long time coming i want my fans to know that creatively and lyrically they can expect the same content and the same messages the people will always know what the real title of this album is and what to call it
6338109 everybody is trying to stop the title its just people being scared of whats real somebody is trying to open up dialogue for people to talk people high up who arent really understanding what im doing are scared
6338110 theyre scared for reasons i understand but the fans gotta know either way this is the same album the content is the same the direction is the same the message is gonna be everything i intended it to be musically
6338111 f amp soulja boy even your name single handedly killed hip hop we came all the way from big daddy kan e and you came along with your soulja boy shit and destroyed it man that shit is garbage
6338112 this nigger is old as shit i let you fight my granddaddy and hell kick your ass the last time i heard of the nigger was in a super heros book
6338113 truthfully a brotha of my caliber should not be talking down to a youngster of your age but as for your music its garbage hip hop has gotta last forever and it cant with you doin that superman bullshit when i diss theres no ramification you cant hurt my career cuz i cant die but when you go against me you go against the whole west coast you go against all the ogs and trust me there will be ramifications
6338114 its what you grow up as a kid and wish for
6338115 i think that would be easy to fall back on and point fingers
6338116 id prefer to take the high road and stay away from that
6338117 a teacher should always look the part of a teacher
6338118 theyre very raw very cut and dry its like drums and guitar its that simple and i love that i think that combining that style with mine which already has a raw feel to it and my voice i just think we could do something really interesting that mixes rock and soul together the blues and emotion and it could be really touching
6338119 weve had some conversations when the time works out and it definitely will it will happen
6338120 thats not our bag i didnt spend a year in the most expensive studio in england with the most expensive producer in america and the most expensive graphic designer in london to then give it away fuck that
6338121 to be honest to me it looked like marketing a great way of getting a load of marketing for free really but good for them thats what they do theyre rebels and outsiders
6338122 there is footage being shot of britney some time this week in conjunction with madonnas upcoming sticky amp sweet tour
6338123 i think a lot of it has to do with the fact that she was never allowed to have a childhood
6338124 she didnt get to grow up and make mistakes privately and try things out and just be a kid and be innocent shes been watched judged and been under a microscope since shes been a teenager its hard to evolve that way
6338125 there just so much drama i didnt expect i actually came dangerously close to not doing season three because i really didnt want to do the show with heidi and spencer
6338126 i have been the most religious person since i was 2 years old i always felt this crazy connection to god i consider myself kind of non denominational baptist
6338127 the paradigm in the music business has shifted and as an artist and a businesswoman i have to move with that shift
6338128 for the first time in my career the way that my music can reach my fans is unlimited ive never wanted to think in a limited way and with this new partnership the possibilities are endless who knows how my albums will be distributed in the future thats whats exciting about this deal everything is possible live nation has offered me a true partnership and after twenty five years in the business i feel that i deserve that
6338129 you just cant think about it you have to go out and give your team the best chance to win
6338130 but i dont think im pitching as bad as its made out to be
6338131 sometimes i get caught up in trying not to make a mistake because one can make the difference right now
6338132 thats the reality of the situation i know theres not a lot of room for error
6338133 avril lavignes girlfriend music video is less than 1 million views away from becoming the most watched video of all time on youtube so what were attempting wont be easy but bahh who am i kidding of course it will be easy because we have a secret weapon
6338134 that record is real its coming you know me i was starting to doubt it myself and then i went up in there and he played so much music for me it knocked my head off i see what he got them waiting for its on and poppin he got records he got heat
6338135 i see what he got them waiting for its on and poppin
6338136 its not painful where i cant play i feel good to go
6338137 that might take him a while to get settled because of who he is his makeup and how he goes about things hes quiet
6338138 i think hes pretty much available until we see something different
6338139 i think his fastball command has been as good as its been all year and hes back to being pretty economical as far as the number of pitches hes throwing per inning
6338140 if he wasnt able to throw a strike when he had to then id be worried about his delivery and his mechanics
6338141 for me the approach has been all wrong he hasnt been focused on staying down in the strike zone he hasnt been focused on getting contact on the ground early in counts and thats who he is hes pitched too cautiously hes a contact ground ball guy
6338142 all year long weve been trying to preserve what weve got here
6338143 wyclef had heard scribes music prior to them meeting and was so impressed that he invited him to perform a guest verse on the remix
6338144 it has to be challenging the worst thing you can tell me is it cant be done when im in the studio what im most interested in is creating music that truly moves people wherever they may be in the world by collaborating with my man scribe from new zealand we created a vibe on this track that can truly cross boundaries
6338145 it was a great honour to have the opportunity to work with wyclef
6338146 he has been an inspiration to me since i was a teenager and quite possibly i wouldnt be mcing today without his musical influence i was the biggest fugees fan and never dreamed id meet him let alone be asked to record with him
6338147 surely theres a way for quebec to participate without threatening its sacrosanct field of competency
6338148 this is an initiative that is good for canadians and good for quebeckers and if it can save even one life we owe it to ourselves to make an effort
6338149 ive been around for about six years and my kids are getting bigger and sometimes im gone for a long time so i feel like a deadbeat dad
6338150 i know what im doing is securing their future financially but i miss the time that i get to spend with them
6338151 the good thing about that is it kept me in california and i got to take my kids to karate class and tutoring and basketball games i fell in love with being a father
6338152 i have yet to actually see someone in hip hop retire and not come back to the game
6338153 ive seen forced retirement where no one buys their records anymore but not when they still have the ability to sell records and make money theres a degree of being out of touch with reality that clouds their vision and allows them to think that they can retire when they havent maxed out their earning potential in the three to five year window they have
6338154 growing up i always knew i had a deviated septum on the right side of my nose which caused trouble breathing
6338155 the older i got the worse it got i went to get it checked out and the doctor told me the septum was 80 percent deviated and that i had two small fractures on my nose
6338156 i didnt do this because i believe in plastic surgery i did this to help my health i literally almost could not breathe out of the right side of my nose
6338157 i want my fans to know the truth im not someone who is going to act like i had nothing done i just want to be honest because my fans are everything to me
6338158 my daughter is healthy and just fine but my husband and i just dont know why anyone would spread such a rumor and what really upsets me is that anyone can write anything and it ends up on the internet its so irresponsible so many people will just assume its a fact
6338159 you can have good location and get the loss or bad location and get the win
6338160 i think hes definitely capable of pitching like he did consistently
6338161 weve always had big expectations for brett when you hand him the ball you know theres a chance he can pitch like that
6338162 it wasnt something that i could control at that point
6338163 i think we all wanted brett to finish that game just as much as he wanted to finish that game
6338164 kanye forget about any of the haters you are beyond brilliant and i am already craving a new cd
6338165 you are a great artist glow on the dark concert was the most amazing thing
6338166 sometimes i go 2 3 days w o sleep working on my performance i have to ice my knees after every show and they hurt when i walk through the airport having an expensive stage cuts my payday in half call me what you want but never say i didnt give my all
6338167 when my legal team is finished with them taco bell is going to have a new corporate slogan we messed with the bull and got the horns
6338168 axl ripped off my braids i ripped off his album title
6338169 the number one worst cover song celine dion covering ac dc is sacrilege
6338170 the best covers are unlikely choices and they do something radical
6338171 it seemed kinda funny it looked as if they didnt know what they were singing about
6338172 there are a couple of precursors to us making the offer
6338173 one is we want to make the offer in the native language of the build that youre running and were having text localized and translated now
6338174 were refocusing efforts on delivering a firefox 2 gt 3 major update within the next week
6338175 if it aint broke dont fix it if you start to break it then people arent going to go im sorry but jay z no chance
6338176 glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a sunday night you go
6338177 i dont know about it but im not having hip hop at glastonbury its wrong
6338178 we dont play guitars noel but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music
6338179 ive never ever had a show thats caused this much of a stir so im really looking forward to it ive never been involved in anything this controversial whats the big deal about doing a show i guess its heritage and people hold that dear to their heart and see it one way but thats how the world is
6338180 break with tradition this time and put on something totally different
6338181 he jay z will appeal to the young people and under 25s for sure so thats a big pull for them its not like the traditional one we do like radiohead coldplay and muse and oasis
6338182 people say were getting middle class which is stretching it a bit far but were attracting a lot more people in their 30s and 40s and need to get the
6338183 these kids add so much to the flavour of it and should have a lot of fun the demographic is changing and its slightly worrying
6338184 while im getting ready i like to relax with a drink vodka and lemonade and listen to some james brown then ill have a manicure and pedicure and yes i wax as well i wax my privates i also wear my fragrance unforgivable black
6338185 men owe it to women to make sure they are well groomed
6338186 have you ever needed to take a piss real bad the release is something that cant truly be explained its almost as good as sex
6338187 anytime you can go out there and throw a complete game its awesome
6338188 the fans got into it and started cheering and a standing ovation anytime that happens its great
6338189 thats huge anytime you can get that kind of run support early in the game it kind of takes pressure off you
6338190 you dont have to be as perfect you have a little cushion and it allows you to relax
6338191 its great that were in a little bit of a groove now but we cant get ahead of ourselves
6338192 i spend all day with my son and once in a while if i want to go out and have a mommy daddy night with my husband i am more allowed to do that
6338193 everybody has an opinion and everybody sometimes wants to cause drama and be mean spirited
6338194 but its something that comes with what you do and i learned that very early on
6338195 the heavy metal band you can bring home to mother
6338196 the neptunes is what we do but n e r d is who we are its our life
6338197 you want to be 100 percent sure its kelly and the alleged victim
6338198 all of us felt very much the grayness of this case
6338199 we were uncertain as to the female and the absence of her was a major lack in the case
6338200 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6338201 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6338202 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6338203 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6338204 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia
6338205 even if it was harder than i expected it to be thats not necessarily a bad thing because i grew up a lot
6338206 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6338207 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6338208 ive watched sammy throughout the years tying him its ok i guess
6338209 the show was not only two hours late but was an utter disappointment
6338210 the working title is beverly hills c k because thats what he is
6338211 he never bothers with his daughter i mean what kind of man is that
6338212 moderne theologen betrokken bij de protestantse kerk in nederland die werkzaam zijn of waren als gemeentepredikant geestelijk verzorger kerkelijk werker of anderszins
6338213 leeftijdsgrenzen die trouwens nooit officieel bestaan hebben zijn daarmee ook volledig van de baan
6338214 duitsland is en blijft open voor buitenlandse investeringen het merendeel van de buitenlandse investeringen wordt niet geraakt door het wetsvoorstel
6338215 meer dan 2 miljoen duitse banen zijn afhankelijk van investeerders uit het buitenland we hebben juist meer investeringen nodig niet minder
6338216 were so excited to finally be coming to australia and playing our live show to our fans we realise its taken a while to get there but on this record we were absolutely determined to ensure australia was a country that was on our touring schedule weve heard so much about the place
6338217 i cant imagine being her age and going through what she went through im amazed she kept on
6338218 i know the business can eat you alive but im a calloused old veteran and shes a young teenage girl its a heck of a storm to survive even with maturity
6338219 the accounts were bullish by 10 in the morning the sales the first few hours were exceeding the rate that the kanye album sold a year ago wayne was one of these records that because it was so highly anticipated with the leaks and everything it caused more people to go out at eight in the morning to buy the cd
6338220 like putting a traditional setup and street date on a guy that was just nontraditional it changed dates changed titles changed songs changed the people that were working on it but sonically the record bears out
6338221 my relationship with terry hulk hogan began at a time when terry and linda privately knew their marriage was ending she had left him already although no official papers had been filed christiane told
6338222 terry is a good man good father and good friend and he and i grew close at a time when he was going through a very difficult period it seemed right then but i know it was wrong
6338223 i personally dont like it at all or condone it but shes my mom so i have to show her support
6338224 i am just staying the course and dealing with it and supporting my family im actually on my way to see nick now you know i thought we were one of the normal hollywood families its crazy watching it all fall apart but i hope for the best
6338225 we are trying to entertain in every aspect of our lives
6338226 we want to know where the human race comes from and how many other solar systems are out there
6338227 once we understand a little more about star formation we can hopefully go forward and make predictions about how the process might vary in different parts of the galaxy
6338228 if youre trying to model a cloud simulation then each part of thats cloud formation could be carried out by a different processor because one part of the clouds formation is dependent on another part there is a need to pass information between each different process very quickly which is why we use this network fabric
6338229 with the new computer in place we can run between 100 to 1 000 simulations at once which gives us very good statistics it also allows us to run more precise simulations
6338230 astronomers tend to use unix or linux based operating systems for their work pretty much exclusively a lot of our code tends to be written for those operating systems and we dont write code for microsoft windows
6338231 youre talking about very large data sets we tend not to store them for very long well run the simulation and keep the data for a year or so on dvds
6338232 i think that whitney will do really well with it she is a very likable person
6338233 i would just tell her to have fun with it shes always made it very clear on the hills that she doesnt want her personal life involved on the show so it would definitely mean that she would have to come out of her comfort zone i hope they do the show
6338234 as far as i know ive just been filming for a fourth season of the hills everything is just kind of hearsay at this point the thought of it sounds a little scary because ive always tried to keep things a little bit private i just have to take everything day by day
6338235 this is your boy puff daddy yes puffy daddy the king of the remix is back with
6338236 they call me puff daddy hes back yeah you heard me right i said puff daddy im about to back on that puff daddy shit
6338237 im writing a film a comedy for actresses who could be cast im thinking angelina jolie or sienna miller for actors eddie murphy
6338238 id like to do something with madonna in malawi i see what she does and i think its fantastic id like to help in any way i can
6338239 they told you they had been offered a 300 000 book deal
6338240 if you dont believe them it was a coded way of getting money from my client in exchange for not testifying
6338241 does everyone who wants to have a book deal have to clear it with jack palladino
6338242 did you monitor every phone conversation to see what does and doesnt exist im trying to figure out where this alleged extortion is except between your ears
6338243 they said that how dare they that is extortion at its best
6338244 i see a black mark but that does not appear to be a mole there is no mole on the back that i can perceive
6338245 then he took four rock like substances from under his hat
6338246 we had a 70 reduction in the email server in just four weeks from a business perspective mailmeter helped our lawyers with legal compliance and means they dont need not worry about the emails it has reduced the size of email storage back up times and improved productivity
6338247 as every guy knows close male friendships arent just a quirky television plotline or a running gag in the moviesbromance is the first reality series to fully explore the essence of these life long friendships
6338248 theres a hunger there again its about brining people together and making them feel good
6338249 one of the main problems is that you grow a lot mentally between the ages of 18 and 24 even if youre in an office job thats a strain but for us we did it touring
6338250 its about standing strong being comfortable with your self and realising there is a future there is something to look forward to
6338251 a lot of the album is about personal mental battles not giving in to the negative thoughts
6338252 we know we cant save the world but we can do our little bit to make people feel part of it and bring them out of the unconscious i want people to feel like i do when im singing these songs i want them to feel in the moment not disconnected we want people to be able to express themselves yeah the swagger is back
6338253 flesh will be home july 10 hes supposed to be getting out bizzy was at one of my last shows in riverside california we had a good conversation there when everything got right we was gonna come back together and do what we had to do
6338254 as far as bone as a group and us we together it aint just a rumor we are trying to put it all back together for real
6338255 we all just been hibernating trying to come up with the concept for the album
6338256 its definitely going down i aint gonna say its 100 percent just because of the label situation and the technical stuff like if the label wants to pay what we deserver as far as bone as group and us we together it aint just a rumor we are trying to put it all back together for real
6338257 we aint started yet because we are trying to get paperwork together we done talked to swizz swizz is on deck and we are ready to roll and make it do what it do baby
6338258 viva la vida was written and demoed in march 2007 which is more than six months before this band claim chris went to see them we totally refute their claims
6338259 i never wrote a song without stealing something from somebody else
6338260 i think as much as possible we look at what other people are doing and try and steal all the good bits from all of them so you look at umbrella by rihanna and you think oh that drum beats good then you look at stronger by kanye west and you think oh those glasses are good then you look at green day so you are affected by everything thats going on
6338261 dont throw any sh t at me if you throw something at me im not so sick that i cant go down there and beat the f amp king shit out of you i may have a f king 102 temperature and ive been puking for two days but ill still butt f amp k you in front of your friends
6338262 you wanna throw something at him too or are you all cool are you all good
6338263 you know this d amp less f ck turd has no friends anyways i came here for the rest of you not this a hole
6338264 after careful consideration ashlee simpson has decided to postpone her summer tour
6338265 she is committed to giving her fans the best show possible and will be back better than ever and ready to rock in the future
6338266 every woman no matter who they are or what they do for a living has the right to wait at least 3 months before sharing this very personal news
6338267 we wanted to wait until after the first trimester and get a clean bill of health from our doctors before confirming anything just like any other couple
6338268 being a boy i have no idea how to respond to such things and my first instinct was to protect her and the baby
6338269 its insane that you cant let happy news brew in hollywood this wasnt about press or anything it was about the health of the baby and trying to find a way to be happy with what should be the most happy time of our lives in the middle of a press blitz i apologize to anyone who felt misinformed but the truth is the person and growing baby is who i felt most loyal to protect and defend
6338270 i havent written a song for britney yet but i would love to id like to help out because theres a girl who needs some help shes been hurt and hurt is the root core essence of good music
6338271 the producers were bouncing around the idea of casting britney in the role of sandy theyre recasting the roles in july and they thought that britney looked like a sandy she would be terrific
6338272 james wants lily to take on a bigger part but she is happy with a cameo
6338273 i find it funny shes a musician now because she never used to be into music at school
6338274 kids drink responsibly or youll end up looking like this not pretty
6338275 prison service has strict rules which preclude staff from eating prisoner meals but we would encourage staff to identify opportunities for communicating with prisoners in less formal settings and eating their respective food together is one of those opportunities
6338276 although a significant amount of fuel has been lost from the kumea ii the light nature of diesel compared to other oils means it would have broken up very quickly in the rough seas in the area and is unlikely to cause any lasting environmental damage

6338288 het monetaire beleid in de verenigde staten moet wel aanslaan en de financi le problemen moeten worden opgelost als dat in november nog niet gebeurt ziet het er een stuk somberder uit
6338289 de grote vraag voor de toekomst is of banken klaar zijn met geld ophalen als dat zo is zijn we positiever gestemd over 2009
6338290 de problemen op de amerikaanse huizenmarkt houden langer aan dan we dachten onze prognoses over de amerikaanse economie in 2008 blijven overeind maar die over 2009 niet in dat jaar zien we een krappe 1 procent groei terwijl we in november vorig jaar nog rekenden met ruim 2 procent
6338291 er vindt een verzuring plaats op de amerikaanse huizenmarkt die doorwerkt in de bezittingen van banken bovendien staat de arbeidsmarkt onder druk daarmee is er sprake van een giftige cocktail bij de verwachtingen van banken vorig jaar zijn deze problemen onderschat

6338309 customers already adopting a virtualised storage strategy are fast realising the benefits of reduced operational costs and improved data availability
6338310 archive manager has shortened backup restore and system down times by 62 from four hours to 1 5 hours when we consider that we have 200 employees in the front office who might not be able to settle funds whilst e mail is down the time savings can prevent potentially huge revenue loss
6338311 it was a matter of prioritizing time to market on certain features as part of a much larger major release
6338312 users indicated that even a command line version would solve enough problems for them that theyd rather not wait
6338313 i try to avoid storage virtualization appliances if i can
6338314 adding another device to my environment goes away from my principle of keeping things as simple as possible
6338315 it would be nice to have something like the xp array aggregate and manage all our storage from both physical and virtual servers as one pool which storage vmotion wont do
6338316 storage vmotion doesnt do everything storage virtualization devices can do such as allowing two storage devices to look like one
6338317 but this needs to be a warning shot to the storage industry the boundaries are shifting theres going to be a major transformation in the way servers and storage work together over the next two to three years
6338318 if i were ibm or hitachi id figure out how best to integrate my product with storage vmotion
6338319 you need that big engine for tons and tons of data
6338320 we are talking about how to better leverage storage system tools even existing block copy tools
6338321 using storage vmotion to migrate metadata and storage virtualization tools to migrate the bulk of the data in the background its definitely a conversation weve had
6338322 any interruption of access to health plan information or even our own internal business data would be completely unacceptable the file storage virtualisation solution allowed us to perform all data migration tasks without any downtime and without the need to manually reconfigure client systems and applications moreover we have been able to streamline and automate all future data movement

6338324 after reading the comment by duff matt dave and the illustrious guitar hero saul hudson a k a slash i find it humorous that the so called four founding members of velvet revolver better known to themselves as the project before i officially named the band would decide to move on without me after i had already claimed the group dead in the water on march 20 in glasgow

6338331 pharrell made me cry you know when you get angry with someone and youre spitting snot i was in a sensitive mood in the studio and i didnt understand the rhythm he wanted me to sing in and he was giving me a hard time i was taken back by how he was talking to me
6338332 we went upstairs and i said you cant talk to me like that and burst into tears and he said oh my god madonna has a heart we had it out and now i love him and we make great music together
6338333 we all had our hiccups where we jockeyed for positions and we tried to get to know each other because song writing is a very intimate experience i would say there were a few uncomfortable moments but with pharell he actually made me cry ive never told anyone that before there out with it
6338334 it made sense for us because were about to release our studio best of
6338335 and this was i thought a really interesting way of putting our name and music into peoples heads before that release also im looking forward to seeing how it affects live numbers
6338336 it would be an insult to all those record stores who have supported prince throughout his career
6338337 it would be yet another example of the damaging covermount culture which is destroying any perception of value around recorded music the artist formerly known as prince should know that with behaviour like this he will soon be the artist formerly available in record stores and i say that to all the other artists who may be tempted to dally with the mail on sunday
6338338 now i dont know what type of person john was or what he did to get himself into this situation i know he was pretty aggressive and he used to yell at people and he used to do stuff for some reason man god laid some pretty heavy shit on that kid man i dont know what he was into
6338339 what happened to my brother and our friend john was horrible and very hard for both of our families but i truly believe my brother and john saved my life and my best friends life i dont know if you heard but my friend and i got into a really bad car accident today ourselves as i turned on my car i clicked my seatbelt as we pulled out onto the road i looked over and realized my friend didnt have her seatbelt on i reminded her to put it on and the minute she clicked it a car crashed into us it was a horrible car accident one that most would be severely hurt in but we had our seatbelts on and they kept us in tight i have to thank my brother and my best friend john for teaching me an important lesson that saved our lives
6338340 i thought of all of my friends who were struggling musicians who would kill for this opportunity so i couldnt really pass it up

6338345 why is the world so freaked out that we have standards
6338346 modeling has always been one of my aspirations but i was insecure about my height i thought i was 5 foot 7 inches but i just found out that im 5 foot 8 inches so im really excited about that
6338347 i have a couple of cool things that im working on the coolest thing about steve amp barrys is they cater to everyday people i wont say that my line will be like theirs i want to stay true to who i am but most importantly it has to be affordable
6338348 i want to challenge myself and do things that are a bit edgier
6338349 im reaching further and digging inside and im not afraid of what comes out
6338350 ive known great art to have come out of horrible tragic times
6338351 in his short life tupac went through an awful lot and i think thats one of the reasons people call him one of the greatest of all times struggles and controversy can make strong records
6338352 dont boo ill find your phone and ring your mum and tell them about your bad manners manners cost you nothing

6338356 definitely ill have another album come out for sure i just dont know when yet i only have the summer off then ill be taping another season of bff but an album is something ill do
6338357 all catching the eye of music industry peers over the last 12 months
6338358 we said no to a certain reality tv show recently
6338359 and we had to draw the line and say no i just didnt want to be associated with people i try to spend my life avoiding

6338363 i was in the friend zone with her for a good solid year id be like calling her id be following her around like a puppy dog
6338364 recently when britney was having a sleepless night she decided to call kevin at nearly 2 a m while they initially chatted about their boys
6338365 they have phone sex often at least once a week
6338366 the one thing those two have in common is their need for sex and after they get going there are no holds barred
6338367 no nonsense beautiful beach babe whose boyfriend caters to her every demand
6338368 you fight you make up you get along but we are still friends and we love each other
6338369 had a blast at the concert enjoy ed the music and audrina was the furthest thing from their minds
6338370 its important to me that this album gets to the fans
6338371 its been a long time coming i want my fans to know that creatively and lyrically they can expect the same content and the same messages its that important the streets have been waiting for this for a long time the people will always know what the real title of this album is and what to call it
6338372 record stores are gonna have a problem in this day and time selling a record with that title
6338373 who knows what that title will be it was important to me to let the fans know what the album would be musically everybody is trying to stop the title it kind of comes off as something that can be disrespectful our older black people can take it the wrong way some non blacks can take it the wrong way and it becomes a thing that becomes controversial in all the wrong ways i accept that im here to do music im here to rap about what i feel and what makes sense to me
6338374 her behavior appeared to demonstrate how easy it is to do just that
6338375 her students are all required to do videos for her class so we end up with huge file storage requirements
6338376 a key thing is for us to store those in a reasonable manner without having to buy 5 000 servers to do it on a second piece for us was to have fast enough throughput on the system to avoid tying up the network as a whole
6338377 the general rule is that any organisation should have a document and data retention policy but there is no universal policy that suits every business
6338378 these include providing evidence for disputes because in this country you would want to keep any documents relating to a contract for six years in case someone brought a lawsuit in that period
6338379 you have small quantities of data but you have orders of magnitude more files
6338380 financial institutions using instant messaging for customer broker interactions may have to keep those for compliance purposes it is not capacity that is the problem there it is the number of discrete items that you have to keep track of
6338381 it is all down to how good the index is
6338382 you can perform indexing a sort of pre search through those files you could conduct some voice recognition and then store the information somewhere and that will then give you a reference into your data
6338383 you can search the index for what you need and if it transpires for example that a certain voice conversation is interesting you can go and look at it then
6338384 it is the index that gets hit a lot so you must be careful that the link to the index is not slow
6338385 it is not the best at defining what that metadata is
6338386 students and faculty have a lot more time than we do in it to think about how they want to describe their data
6338387 the content only gets hit very occasionally when someone wants to read something so if you have discs that can spin down then you save vast amounts of power
6338388 the first use is to address the challenge how do i store a billion voice messages without having to worry about what my file system looks like
6338389 we needed drives that were fast enough sans that when it came to backing up to another disc and retrieving the images and the information it would not take a day and a half to do it
6338390 each node has 4gbytes of cache so a 10 node cluster has a 40gbyte cache
6338391 basically we did virtualisation ourselves and now we are asking how we virtualise and extend to communities that are not within our group
6338392 flexible automated management products that fully leverage server resources and allow the movement of workloads are necessary for optimising the datacentre
6338393 over the next three years heterogeneous virtualisation architectures will be the norm for most it organisations as such they must purchase datacentre management products that offer an ongoing opportunity for lowering operational costs as well as integrating and managing virtual machines across both server and storage infrastructures for greater control and visibility
6338394 our employee file data has expanded by 50 to 600gbytes in 18 months with much of the increase being driven by the growing popularity of multimedia files
6338395 we were running out of disc space our full weekly backup was taking up to 14 hours and it was fast getting to the
6338396 we are currently running a consultation exercise involving various departments within the university to help agree the policies that will underpin our ilm programme
6338397 part of this will be about what and how we archive what data can be automatically transferred to the archive if it hasnt been modified or accessed for a certain time period and what will need to be kept on line for longer
6338398 i gotta admit we were like lindsay lohan but i will say this we gave her a quality record and she did a ridiculously fabulous job i was so shocked i had to call her and apologize for what i was thinking because she did so good i think the world is gonna be surprised
6338399 the lead track bossy is basically about a woman being strong enough to get what she wants when she wants it in this case bossy is a term that describes confidence and power
6338400 i wrote it for her because when shes on her game you can see these traits in her when shes focused she exudes the aura of a boss with ease
6338401 when producer stargate and i were approached with the task we viewed it as a challenge can we make a song for lindsay lohan that people were gonna take seriously i think we did it
6338402 as you all know i shared with you the announcement of my newborn son xavier kingston joiner on may 15th and also informed you that he was born prematurely well this week was extremely difficult for him because his lungs were not strong enough to handle regular oxygen on his own xavier passed away this morning at 3 30am and i must tell you this it is unnatural for a parent to bury a child i am telling you this because of the same reason i tell you when im having great times life is too short to be fake hold on to your kids if you have them protect them and show them you love them everyday you wake up and see them dont take a second you get to hug them teach them and care for them for granted you can have all the material wealth in the universe but it is nothing compared to having your family i am thankful for all of my blessings and im not one to question gods perfect plan so i leave you with great love and thanks for the love that was sent earlier on my previous blog to my son of course i need to take some time and handle my loss stay focused people its not promised to any of us

6338421 for ms owers to parachute in and make an at times critical report without putting forward how to improve its not the way to take the prison service forward
6338422 she identified areas that we already know but didnt say how to solve them we dont believe she interfaces with or takes the views of prison staff
6338423 frankland is an excellent prison it has some of the most dedicated and professional staff who have won awards for their dedication
6338424 we need to stop this situation where people bury their heads in the sand and look at the problem and find the solution
6338425 we have to put in place training and investment to actually deal with these people muslim prisoners
6338426 the prison service has to make a real effort to make the prison service an attractive job

6338428 to see geisha is beyond the dreams of most japanese people so to have them performing in the local village hall is incredibly exciting
6338429 i had to pay 600 to meet them for one hour but it was worth it
6338430 there is something so intriguing about them and they showed such respect for everyone and everything
6338431 it is a common misconception that geisha are prostitutes which stems from the second world war when prostitutes dressed as geisha for the american gis
6338432 in fact geisha are highly trained and disciplined artists who continue to learn throughout their lives
6338433 as well as the main festival in durham i wanted to organise a performance in my local village hall because its not often you see something so exotic in north yorkshire
6338434 the whole visit is costing me about 20 000 but if i cover my costs it will be worth it i feel so lucky to be able to do this and bring a little bit of japan to my home village
6338435 brian spotted that british rail no longer needed the track
6338436 there was quite a furore and 7 300 people signed a petition and the track was left in place
6338437 what he did probably helped to save the railway in wensleydale
6338438 he is held in high regard by his colleagues and ourselves at the wensleydale railway and we wanted to show our appreciation

6338443 he was conscious and of enough sound mind to call for help
6338444 im in a bit of trouble here can you come as quickly as possible
6338445 obviously he was in tremendous shock he was quite calm
6338446 he was awake and he could talk to the paramedics
6338447 he did not say a great deal throughout the operation but he had raised the alarm himself
6338448 this is very worrying news and i have already raised my concerns with nhs management

6338462 i dont think they have got any evidence against me but i should have been told by now whether action was being taken or not

6338477 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6338478 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6338479 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6338480 we believe that investors are less likely to pay attention to near term earnings rather we would focus on updates of the companies competitive strategies and post restructuring regulatory policy changes

6338506 there are still issues concerning exactly how our forces operate
6338507 ultimately the prime minister has to make the call on moving forward
6338508 a chance for me to meet with the prime minister and see what we can do from washington to get to closure
6338509 theres a sense that its a cutting edge destination where they can be among the first to learn firsthand about another culture
6338510 theres something about being one of the first in your generation to really have a deep understanding
6338511 its probably the most different and most unorthodox place i could think of
6338512 i kind of wanted that as opposed to england where the prestige is there but the life experience is kind of similar
6338513 i think thats one of the real divisions between studying abroad in europe and studying abroad in asia

6338515 were pretty sure that china can take more but exactly how many and in what fields and what would it take to double or quadruple the numbers thats something we as an industry will have to explore
6338516 i would have been sorely disappointed if i had left after the first semester
6338517 honestly its the best thing i could have my done for my career
6338518 i told our members that its just another tool that we can use to get the play right not to look at it as a negative but a positive

6338524 it still seems surreal knowing that my dreams came true and im sitting here today as the olympic champion
6338525 i think america will embrace the two of them because theyre very different personalities
6338526 shawn is the next door neighbor the girl next door
6338527 shes got the ability if she wants it to become iconic
6338528 theres only one americas sweetheart that comes out of the summer games and shes it
6338529 definitely if shawn did not have nastia there and if nastia didnt have shawn there neither one of them would have been so good
6338530 they also push the rest of the girls because they raise the bar so high

6338541 i saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story from the tip of every branch like a fat purple fig a wonderful future beckoned and winked one fig was a husband and a happy home and children and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor and another fig was ee gee the amazing editor and another fig was europe and africa and south america and another fig was constantin and socrates and attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions and another fig was an olympic lady crew champion and beyond and above these figs were many more figs i couldnt quite make out i saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree starving to death just because i couldnt make up my mind which of the figs i would choose i wanted each and every one of them but choosing one meant losing all the rest and as i sat there unable to decide the figs began to wrinkle and go black and one by one they plopped to the ground at my feet

6338547 russell was incredibly gracious to me during a really hard time and in the aftermath
6338548 i empowered myself by not staying in the thing with russell i felt it was going to be repeating some similar patterns that id just gotten out of and it was a drag because i was crazy about him
6338549 he didnt talk and ill always be grateful to him for that but i did not leave my marriage for him i left because it was not working

6338557 when i saw the start he made to the race i just thought wow it was a much better start than the one he made in winning the 100m on saturday this is bolts favourite event and he wanted that record he went for it he came here focused on it he knew that most likely hed win gold but gave it every single thing he had
6338558 my concern and the reason i thought he might not get the world record here was that he wouldnt have been working on his speed endurance the ability to hold that speed for the entire race
6338559 i dont see any reason why he couldnt now move up to the 400m but im not sure if hell be able to break the world record in that
6338560 i dont really think injury can be avoided when youre playing one sport at this level

6338620 you put on a helmet and play a wind controller people gonna look at you crazy its very useful but also serves to put the music itself into a certain context not only from the audiences point of view but also my point of view its very hard to not go off on a really outrageous tangent when youve got that thing on i either get really self conscious or really extroverted
6338621 audiences see the horn they think jazz that theyre gonna hear something pretty or something they are accustomed to some reference point they are going to grasp via the visuals but the helmet serves to change that
6338622 they surrendered because they could no longer take the inhuman instructions and atrocities committed by commander bravo

6338633 die tatsache dass herr glos keine beispiele nennt best tigt dass es keinen konkreten anwendungsfall f r das gesetz gibt au erhalb der r stungsbranche macht das gesetz keinen sinn
6338634 durch die offenheit der formulierung ist nicht ausgeschlossen dass eine sp tere regierung das gesetz doch anwendet negativbeispiele daf r gibt es in den usa

6338755 based on the strength of our second quarter and first half 2008 financial
6338756 while improvements during the second quarter were evident across our key profitability measures we did experience an increase in finance expenses during the second quarter primarily due to the fact that most of the groups debt is linked to the israeli consumer price index which increased 2 24 during the quarter resulting in higher financing expenses as compared to the year ago period we are pleased with the group wide performance in the first half of the year and look forward to building on these gains in the second half of 2008

6338793 mosley will sich nach seiner rehabilitierung durch das gerichtsurteil wieder durchsetzen er will seine ideen durchbringen das schlimme daran ist dass er nicht mehr auf die teams h rt sondern von sich aus einfach irgendwelche dinge vorschl gt diese dinge kommen dann in einem ma e was so gar nicht durchf hrbar ist er hofft drauf dass die teams auf halbem wege einlenken und dann hat er gewonnen
6338794 es ist aber vielmehr immer die sache wenn man kosten sparen will auf der anderen seite entwicklungen vorantreiben und die hersteller halten dann sind das drei verschiedene faktoren ein beispiel kers ist f r die hersteller eine tolle geschichte ist aber auf der anderen seite wieder teuer wenn man alles limitieren will dann hat man eine einheitsformel wie man sie andernorts hat das f nde ich sehr sehr schlecht
6338795 wenn wir in die indycar serie schauen dann haben wir das beste beispiel da geht die attraktivit t total verloren die tun sich so schwer die leute gehen dorthin wo zwei oder drei marken gegeneinander fahren n mlich in die nascar das darf nicht passieren also muss mosley einsehen dass die hersteller sehr wichtig sind und dass genau die hersteller die formel 1 eigentlich machen
6338796 die hersteller sind die formel 1 so ist es nun mal wenn man zur ckdenkt an die zeit als alle cosworth motoren gefahren sind dann ist das vielleicht die gute alte zeit aber heute nicht mehr aktuell man muss hier einen kompromiss finden

6338813 as regards transniestria we reached the conclusion that the involvement of the european union is fundamental and essential in finding a solution
6338814 i and president basescu reached the conclusion that the conflict in south ossetia occurred because of the neglect of settlement of problems of this kind
6338815 it would be very easy for russia to organise a provocation and then the russian might stand ready to react
6338816 i am certain that such a south ossetia type scenario is not possible
6338817 our aim is to receive international guarantees of ukraines territorial integrity which is only possible in the framework of collective security

6338880 we will give both listeners and advertisers what they have been thirsting for
6338881 we are reasonably happy with the results despite the challenges of the first quarter
6338882 we are aggressively investing in our africa network so that when something happens people will stop asking what reuters and bbc are saying and ask what the nation is saying
6338883 the future of the media growth is actually in radio
6338884 it is primarily a swahili station but with a mixture of english as well
6338885 primarily because of the challenge of it its a very similar situation to 1997 when we started in dallas and they hadnt invested back into the system that prepared me to take on this challenge
6338886 but the chancellor had all the right answers to my questions as far as a commitment to making big improvements to this athletic program i believe she will give me what i need
6338887 is confident in mathieus commitment to ensuring the development of our student athletes both academically and athletically
6338888 we have to let people know about jesus we are going to be changing people thats why we are going to be giving stuff out to people like the 10 000 book bags
6338889 performing arts build confidence and self esteem and what is happening is that many inner city children dont have that foundation to let them know that they can be what they want to be
6338890 i think this is a good experience because we are helping other people who are less fortunate than us
6338891 i think that at the end of the day it all comes down to accountability
6338892 we have to be able to hold everyone accountable for the results theyre producing for kids thats the bottom line if you operate within that mind set or that construct then all of your problems are solved
6338893 i think well find out whether were on the right track or the wrong track
6338894 i expect its going to be an important and challenging year
6338895 schools will have been closed people redeployed schools restructured the harder work of sustaining and accelerating student achievement will be at play i think the plate is extremely full but a good foundation was built last year
6338896 dr williams is responsible for some of the most important improvements in the ems program and were sorry to see him leave
6338897 we used to fight about purchasing buses the reconstruction of ballfields none of that in my view had to do with what went on inside the classroom
6338898 i think its really important that we remain an independent voice
6338899 for right now except for the city council the board is the only body that is holding hearings in a formal way
6338900 my own view is that it should be an appointed board and not an elected board
6338901 it would eliminate some of the confusion those who are elected to the state board their constituency still believes that they have some authority over local schools which they dont
6338902 were going to a school where things are not going as fast as we wanted them to
6338903 they did it last year but it will be a lot harder this year
6338904 theyve taken on so much more because of the closings and theyve fired some good people
6338905 one full year into the reform effort however we do not have either of these and that is leading to growing concern over the direction of the reform effort
6338906 no one seems to be able to make the school system cough up information
6338907 we want to make sure as parents that we have some input and say because were actually the people on the ground
6338908 we certainly hope that rhee and company will understand going forward that we really want to be partners we dont want a combative situation
6338909 michelle rhee s not going to fix it in one or two
6338910 its not the fault of the teachers its not the fault of the school board
6338911 now you have a new crop of parents and you want to close the door in their face
6338912 how much people feel respected in their jobs trying to figure out what the best practices are
6338913 we dont want teachers to feel that their sole worth is data
6338914 my concern about the election is that the voters are not going to be paying much attention to whom theyre voting for if its not broken why fix it
6338915 this is a de facto acknowledgement that the work cannot be finished before the start of school
6338916 but there were some inevitable problems that were bound to arise given the decades of neglect of many of these buildings the administration is the first to admit that there is much more to do
6338917 mr lew and his staff have been asked to do the impossible

6338946 the republic of tajikistan being a part of the global community and a member of commonwealth independent states signed a number of important state documents in order to create educational space which requires changes and improvement of the context of education
6338947 this is not a problem that can be simply ignored
6338948 while we often talk about children being the future of a country they are also the present and deserve support now
6338949 education is a cornerstone of economic and social development primary education is its foundation
6338950 primary education completion is crucial for national economic and social advancement
6338951 primary education is a right and should be available to everyone
6338952 certain elements of fairy systematic planning were applied to the development of education in some of the outstanding civilization of the past such as platos republic in ancient greece ancient china during the han dynasty and peru under inca rule under unca rule
6338953 a systematic sustained effort aimed at change in learning conditions and other related conditions in one or more schools with the ultimate aim of accomplishing educational goals more effectively
6338954 school improvement elates to general efforts to make schools better places for pupils and students to learn in
6338955 there is a strong relationship between low primary enrolment and under enrolment of girls
6338956 school will not improve unless teachers individually and collectively developed

6338958 the first game you bring the veterans kind of slow
6338959 by the third game weve got to get them from halftime back on the field because they havent done that yet they need to come out of the locker room and go play again rather than have them wear their baseball hats

6338966 it didnt sound quite right and i looked over the edge but couldnt see anything wrong then when i got out i saw what had happened
6338967 i took a deep bath when i got in the bath water rose you understand
6338968 when they refurbished the old tub they only connected the taps and the drain but not the safety drain just below the taps that deals with overspill theres no connection at all when i got in it raised the level and some water flowed out

6338976 he is talking to nbc next week and we are working out everyones schedule i dont want to put him in just for the sake of having him drop by i want there to be a good reason for him being there and have it be part of the story i talked to david about a way of doing that and so far he likes it its a cool idea
6338977 he doesnt feel that way anymore i just talked with david the other day over breakfast at the beverly hills hotel and explained to him in great detail what we had planned for the show and he said he liked it and gave his approval
6338978 he has known bruce davison for a long time and when i met with him he basically gave me his blessing and i told him everything i wanted to do and he said thats awesome i do not want to get the fans hopes up or anything but im talking to nbc and hes talking to nbc and its all a matter of timing
6338979 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6338980 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn
6338981 under the australian standard truck drivers should have been able to look north for 600 metres up the railway line to see oncoming trains
6338982 but the vegetation growing next to the track meant that truck drivers could only see for 60m
6338983 in other words they could not see an oncoming train until it was too late to do anything about it
6338984 every day truck drivers gamble with death or serious injury when they go over level crossings with badly placed stop signs and inadequate sighting distances he said
6338985 understand news better by seeing pictures rather than reading or hearing
6338986 all worship is an intelligent and loving response to the revelation of god because it is the adoration of his name therefore acceptable worship is impossible without preaching for preaching is making known the name of the lord and worship is praising the name of the lord made known far from being an alien intrusion into worship the reading and preaching of the word are actually indispensable to it the two cannot be divorced indeed it is their unnatural divorce which account for the low level of so much contemporary worship our worship is poor because our knowledge of god is poor and our knowledge of god is poor because our preaching is poor but when the word of god is expounded in its fullness and the congregation begin to glimpse the glory of the living god they bow down in solemn awe and joyful wonder before his throne it is preaching which accomplishes this the proclamation of the word of god in the power of the spirit of god

6338989 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

6338993 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6338994 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6338995 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6338996 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6338997 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6338998 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6338999 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6339000 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6339001 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6339002 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6339003 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6339004 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6339005 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6339006 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6339007 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6339008 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6339009 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6339010 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6339011 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6339012 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6339013 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6339014 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6339015 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6339016 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6339017 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
6339018 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6339019 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6339020 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6339021 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6339022 vegetation adjacent to the crossing had grown to the point where the truck driver could not see the approaching train even if he had stopped as required the atsb said
6339023 the report makes it clear that truck drivers were gambling with their lives whenever they used the two wells level crossing said ata chairman trevor martyn

6339028 that will depend on what the vets decide this afternoon
6339029 our hearts are breaking with whats happening with baby colin
6339030 its hard not to be sad when you see that calf in such a desperate situation
6339031 ive asked my department to look at any options that we might have to assist but we are yet to receive any advice that practically would be successful
6339032 even getting it out to sea doesnt mean saving the whale
6339033 its looking like its too big a mountain to climb
6339034 were racking our brains but we need to be realistic about this
6339035 to look after this little whale you need to suckle it for 11 months thats never been done anywhere in the word before for a whale this size or for that long
6339036 you then need to get it to the antarctic where its food supply is letting it go off sydney its got a 2000km trip to make it doesnt know how to avoid killer whales or how to find krill
6339037 theres a whole range of extremely serious problems with the idea of getting this little whale through to getting it released in the wild thats the advice were getting from every single expert that weve spoken to
6339038 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6339039 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6339040 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6339041 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6339042 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6339043 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6339044 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6339045 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6339046 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6339047 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
6339048 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
6339049 i remember talking with bryan herta last year after i first drove it and we said wow this track is really fast we hadnt been to a track like this for a long long time it is a track that i think we will do well which would be great with the large presence from lowes canada last year we tested well but then we had a bit of a hiccup when i had my accident in practice we have been competitive in the last few races and i dont expect any less here obviously we were disappointed about what happened in elkhart lake left rear suspension failure while running second in class but that hasnt changed our intentions to win i think we are one of the teams that is the most well deserved to win at this point and hopefully things will go our way this sunday
6339050 mosport is one of my favorite tracks for sure last year we had a strong run going with the lola so definitely my expectations with the acura are a lot higher knowing that the acura is a very competitive car we have shown ourselves very strong in the last races so i am confident that we will have a good race here and we would especially love to give a good result to the lowes people in canada that would be great

6339056 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6339057 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6339058 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6339059 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6339060 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
6339061 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
6339062 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
6339063 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
6339064 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6339065 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6339066 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6339067 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6339068 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6339069 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6339070 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6339071 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6339072 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6339073 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6339074 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6339075 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6339076 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6339077 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6339078 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6339079 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6339080 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6339081 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6339082 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6339083 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6339084 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6339085 if you go along there and look carefully at those trees how many have the bark shredded off of them
6339086 its also not a high curb raising the curb profile along the entire thing would obviously be a significant undertaking in terms of capital expenditures
6339087 people have to realize that they are recreating within a few feet of one of the busiest arteries in this town
6339088 it doesnt have enough opportunities for traffic to be calmed by traffic lights or anything else people go too fast
6339089 this definitely is an ongoing concern its not something that were all just gonna chuck away again
6339090 looking back i dont think we had to be so blunt and all right were splitting up really we shouldve just chilled out for a bit and taken some time out to be honest

6339127 los pueblos indigenas me han cambiado la forma de ver e l derecho
6339128 los funcionarios del estado aparecen en el documental ridiculos y sin comprender ciertas cosas
6339129 el secretario de derechos humanos de neuqun ve a la pelicula como muy pol tica y la criticaba por eso
6339130 el inciso 17 se introdujo por cansancio el convenio 169 se ratifico sin leerlo porque si lo leian bien no lo hacian
6339131 roca hizo una ciudadan a de escritorio nos homogeneiz es importante que los pueblos originarios llamen a revertir eso
6339132 los pueblos originarios nos son negocio pol tico porque est n aislados por eso se los invisibiliza hay que salir de la invisibilidad reconociendo la realidad y fortaleciendo su lucha
6339133 un consejo a los abogados no se disfracen de originarios son abogados de la v citma no la v ctima asi se cumple mejor la funci n
6339134 ser a bueno por ejemplo que el colegio de abogados organice una comiison de derecho indigena propuso zaffaroni ganandose el aplauso de la concurrencia tambien hacer un congreso de derecho indigena

6339136 and it shall come to pass because ye hearken to these ordinances and keep and do them that the lord thy god shall keep with thee the covenant and the mercy which he swore unto thy fathers
6339137 these are the lighter commandments which a person treads with his heels
6339138 and it shall come to pass because ye hearken to these ordinances and keep and do them that the lord thy god shall keep with thee the covenant and the mercy and he will love thee and bless thee
6339139 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy might
6339140 my sense is if one of the agencies in the executive branch were to take overall control of the sex offender registry wed all be better served
6339141 the candidates packet for the gubernatorial race the senatorial race and the delegate race are all ready sex offenders failing to register online targeted by task force
6339142 my wish was to come and see my sister in guam because shes missed all my treatment and she left right before we knew what was going on and shes been telling me how beautiful the island is and its so much fun here

6339149 she went into the store and found him in the rear storage area with his hands tied behind his back and his feet bound with tape and string shot once in the head
6339150 i knew him he was a muslim boy a good dude nice as all outdoors this is a senseless killing
6339151 we are a peaceful people we came here for a better life that boy came here for a better life now his life is destroyed
6339152 this is a once in a blue moon thing i guess
6339153 you people need to be wearing no snitch t shirts
6339154 i carried it back to my van and laid it on a towel to dry
6339155 whoever it belonged to we wanted them to get it back especially if they lost a lot in the fire
6339156 they might still be running around and getting new licenses identification and a place to live
6339157 over the last year we are seeing a speculative bubble in oil this has really been the decade of the bubble there has been a tech bubble a real estate bubble and now we are seeing a commodity bubble and oil is at the vanguard of this bubble
6339158 we believe the moment is right for a one off windfall tax to guarantee social and environmental justice
6339159 ministers should be clawing back the money from the energy companies 9bn european windfall to help protect struggling households from the effects of fuel poverty
6339160 edfs purchase of british energy was the governments get out of jail free card which hasnt materialised
6339161 there are tough decisions to be made as the reality is britain will run short of power our crumbling infrastructure and lack of political will to sort has left assets ripe for picking off by larger european energy companies
6339162 right across government and local government there wont be a public service thats not affected by high energy bills and the chancellor can do something about it if he uses the windfall to ease the pressure and secondly from a scottish point of view this is the moment when we must start an oil fund
6339163 we knew that a rescue operation would in practice mean the death of the hostages
6339164 but if it was my fate to die in a rescue at least i could hold onto the hope that my family would have the certainty of a cadaver the peace of being able to bury me and not the uncertainty of an indefinite kidnapping
6339165 all appeared well as they exited the air force c 17 without fanfare
6339166 when i tried to collect the personal accident insurance that tommy had paid for i was told that i could not be paid for the insurance because my husband did not work for northrop grumman
6339167 the president authorized me to disclose this situation and said that once all legal requirements are met he would be willing to extradite the two rebels

6339169 but when it arrived one of the men aboard the helicopter appeared to know the rebel commanders and the hostages lost hope

6339172 if terria wins the bid the very first thing i will do is contact telstra chairman donald mcgauchie or telstra ceo sol trujillo and offer them an equity shareholding in our company
6339173 the only reason i would do that is because we want the network to service the whole of the industry on equal terms and i think telstra investing as an equity owner would give the assurance that the network was being operated fairly
6339174 under our bid the major equity owner would be the commonwealth government we will then fund the build with a mix of equity investment and debt after that it will just be a matter of working out what the most efficient capital structure is
6339175 terria would give telstra as big a share as they wanted so long as they wont be able to control the consortium
6339176 telstra would be like any other equity owner in the consortium who has an interest in making sure the network was properly run but not able to influence the outcomes in their favour or to a disadvantage to the other equity holders
6339177 if the business case of this 8 shelf company terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board
6339178 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6339179 telstra invests in networks like next g and next ip while terria invests in airport billboards telstra has made absolutely clear that if it builds the nbn it will provide open and equivalent access to everyone
6339180 the nbn project marks the biggest infrastructure investment in the countrys history it has enormous potential to benefit the nation if it enhances competition but if it shuts down competition which it could to do then it has enormous potential to be a disaster
6339181 we believe particularly because there is so much taxpayer money in this project that the first areas to be serviced should be those that are currently underserviced
6339182 golden week is primarily made up of various national holidays in japan within a very short span of time usually one right after another so you have travelers from 6 7 to 9 days

6339184 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6339185 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6339186 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6339187 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6339188 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6339189 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6339190 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6339191 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6339192 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6339193 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6339194 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6339195 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
6339196 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6339197 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6339198 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6339199 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6339200 you could throw a body in there and you wouldnt find it
6339201 we want them to tear the rest of the building down or make it so it isnt an eyesore drug dealers can go in there and smoke people bring there trash there its dangerous for kids
6339202 we complained to everybody there were 15 squatters living at the same time in that house
6339203 i cant afford an air conditioner but these squatters had one they had tvs refrigerators stealing electricity they were living it up
6339204 i called the police two weeks before the fire but they just took a report i told them the squatters were there
6339205 you might as well not call because they dont come
6339206 officers will tell police radio to call l amp i to have the place resealed but were not here to board up places so now its incumbent on l amp i to board it up
6339207 its a dynamic number you make the efforts to treat the worst of the worst and you start over again next year
6339208 l amp i has not been examined with this kind of scrutiny and it needs to be because no matter what anybody there does they are playing triage constantly
6339209 i dont think they have the necessary resources to do their job adequately
6339210 many algerians are not happy with this because those companies bring chinese workers with them this doesnt help us cope with unemployment
6339211 many traders here can no longer afford even to pay for their childrens education
6339212 a chinese worker gets about 300 dirhams 41 a month a moroccan wants around 2 000 dirhams for 300 dirhams you might as well commit suicide
6339213 spanned the usually fractious ties between the countrys trade unions businessmen and government officials
6339214 the biggest problem we face now is the language barrier and the different customs and culture between zambians and the chinese
6339215 for most ordinary africans it is these chinese small scale entrepreneurs and most especially retail traders who have had the greatest impact on their lives
6339216 in namibia the rather positive image of chinese shop owners as energetic people who bring affordable foods to the poor has been supplanted by the negative image of greedy business people profiting from selling worthless junk

6339246 what we are looking at specifically is black history in communities across the state how black communities developed where they were located who comprised black communities and what they looked like
6339247 were the first state in the nation to undertake this kind of a comprehensive survey and analysis of black history
6339248 pennsylvania has taken a leadership role here in looking at this history and evaluating its significance
6339249 in these communities there were significant black populations that to a larger extent were not well understood
6339250 part of what were trying to do is to have them understood a little better
6339251 i think its an important project for this museum to work on
6339252 we certainly look forward to the products that can come out of this project
6339253 the thinking behind what we can do with this information is limitless
6339254 in pennsylvania even rural areas played a significant role in the underground railroad
6339255 where we find evidence of it we are looking at the underground railroad
6339256 were finding a rich history of underground railroad activity around those areas
6339257 were collecting genealogy information and oral histories and were also detailing how to find hidden histories in cemeteries destroyed homes and things like that
6339258 one thing that we find is that everyone wants to have their community studied

6339263 my brother would do anything for anybody hes one of a kind
6339264 he just likes to help people what else could he do here
6339265 this is an exceptional important step particularly for new jerseyans who struggle with property taxes as well as all of the other rising levels of inflationary costs
6339266 on the state level we remain vigilant in our dedication to property tax relief for homeowners
6339267 over 600 000 here in new jersey own property pay property taxes but do not itemize on their income taxes
6339268 as a senior citizen on a fixed income this is certainly going to help with our property taxes

6339270 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6339271 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6339272 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6339273 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6339274 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6339275 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6339276 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

6339278 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6339279 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6339280 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6339281 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6339282 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6339283 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6339284 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6339285 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6339286 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6339287 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6339288 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6339297 chris understood that his continuing presence in the office would be a distraction
6339298 i did not reach this decision lightly chris has been a loyal and effective city employee for many years he deserves the presumption of innocence unless and until the courts find otherwise
6339299 should chris be exonerated of all charges i would welcome him back as chief of staff and do whatever is necessary to see that he receives full back pay
6339300 with sadness i announce that i have requested a leave of absence from my duties as chief of staff for councilman jack kelly i have taken this action because it is in the councilmans best interest and the best interests of the citizens of philadelphia i have requested that my leave begin immediately and extend until after the trial of the charges against me
6339301 its time to make a declaration that animals need to be protected

6339303 and these abused and neglected animals suffer more than any of us can imagine
6339304 when we started the hotline we estimated 200 calls per month which would have been 1 200 calls after six months
6339305 im hoping it will send a message and that message will be heard
6339306 we will not tolerate the abuse and neglect of animals any longer

6339308 i got out of the marines with the intention of becoming a high school teacher

6339310 in some ways weve reduced their anxiety and in other ways weve increased it
6339311 every time you go in its like your first time ever
6339312 the fact that they even take time to have something like this helps me with my anxieties
6339313 i hope i can be that great history teacher for my students one day

6339318 these guys totally took my baby out of the neighborhood for people to keep passing judgment they dont even know him
6339319 he wanted to be president and he wanted to be a basketball player
6339320 he said he dont ever want no friends again ever
6339321 he doesnt even want to go outside they had to manipulate him he is only 11 hes a sweet boy
6339322 it had to be because aint no way in the world theyre going to go through something like that on their own
6339323 hes upset about his picture being released and his name being linked to these crimes that he has had absolutely nothing to do with
6339324 i dont want any officer or any resident to think hey i can relax now we dont want them scared but we want them aware
6339325 could still be out here walking in the crowd he may have had a partner

6339332 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6339333 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6339334 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6339335 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6339336 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6339337 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6339338 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6339339 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6339340 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6339341 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6339342 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6339343 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6339344 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6339345 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6339346 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6339347 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6339348 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6339349 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6339350 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6339351 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6339352 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6339353 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6339354 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6339355 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6339356 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6339357 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

6339380 the goal should not be to see how much money you can raise from stuggling families in south jersey
6339381 but there needs to be money available to be sure the bridges are in safe condition
6339382 its never popular to vote on a toll increase but it is my conclusion that it is the appropriate thing to do
6339383 it is our responsibility to make sure these bridges are operational and safe the public can be assured that 100 percent of the money will go into these structures
6339384 the drpa is a public authority run on public money and should give credence to public input

6339413 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6339414 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6339415 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6339416 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6339417 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6339418 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6339419 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6339420 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6339421 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6339422 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

6339425 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6339426 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6339427 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6339428 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6339429 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

6339433 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6339434 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6339435 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6339436 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6339437 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6339438 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6339439 el estado actualmente es bastante tranquilo pensar que han pasado la pr cticamente la noche entera aqu las cosas cada vez est n m s asimiladas y a medida que va pasando el tiempo la tranquilidad se va instaurando en ellos

6339443 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success
6339444 but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication

6339447 one of superintendent kevin maxwells slogans is going from good to great and we arent going to get to great if we focus only on proficient

6339449 going to need a lot more phonics and word work than their more affluent counterparts
6339450 you dont need to do anything special they just need a lot more of it they need more support they need more practice
6339451 if terria wins the bid the very first thing i will do is contact telstra chairman donald mcgauchie or telstra ceo sol trujillo and offer them an equity shareholding in our company
6339452 the only reason i would do that is because we want the network to service the whole of the industry on equal terms and i think telstra investing as an equity owner would give the assurance that the network was being operated fairly
6339453 under our bid the major equity owner would be the commonwealth government we will then fund the build with a mix of equity investment and debt after that it will just be a matter of working out what the most efficient capital structure is
6339454 terria would give telstra as big a share as they wanted so long as they wont be able to control the consortium
6339455 telstra would be like any other equity owner in the consortium who has an interest in making sure the network was properly run but not able to influence the outcomes in their favour or to a disadvantage to the other equity holders
6339456 if the business case of this 8 shelf company terria is reliant on telstra taking a substantial equity stake they need to go back to the drawing board
6339457 telstra has made it totally clear it is not interested in playing lovey dovey with its competitors
6339458 telstra invests in networks like next g and next ip while terria invests in airport billboards telstra has made absolutely clear that if it builds the nbn it will provide open and equivalent access to everyone
6339459 the nbn project marks the biggest infrastructure investment in the countrys history it has enormous potential to benefit the nation if it enhances competition but if it shuts down competition which it could to do then it has enormous potential to be a disaster
6339460 we believe particularly because there is so much taxpayer money in this project that the first areas to be serviced should be those that are currently underserviced
6339461 its a very hard thing to watch because youre actually witnessing somebody die and its terrible

6339463 focus on finding ways to enhance the firefox user experience increase user control over personal information and provide new opportunities for developers to build innovative online experiences
6339464 whats happening is the taxpayers are under assault like weve never seen before
6339465 we have not seen an assault on taxpayers of this magnitude since the tax revolt leading up to proposition 13 three decades ago
6339466 our elected leadership at both the state and local levels is pushing california into the coveted position of the highest tax state in america if that happens it will be economic suicide for the golden state
6339467 the fact is the state has not invested in its infrastructure in the last 25 or 30 years so california counties have stepped forward and proposed tax increases to fund specific transportation and flood control projects
6339468 taxes dont create jobs its not right to rob the working people of their hard earned money they need to support themselves and their families
6339469 instead of the government providing better services in giving taxpayers a fair return for their taxes they want to tax people more they should utilize the dollars they currently have for government services and programs
6339470 with all the budgetary problems going on and the increased pressures on local governments and school districts debt is going to be an important issue to look at in the future
6339471 we pay taxes on our phone bills we pay taxes on our electric bill parcel taxes hotel taxes just about everything you do seems to be taxed
6339472 many of these taxes taken individually seem to be for good causes but the cumulative effect is they have made california a very expensive state in which to live and do business voters have to take that into account when they have a chance to vote on some of these taxes and bonds
6339473 something might be marketed as a great idea to fight gangs expand public transportation or improve local schools but they have to weigh the benefits against the long term costs of paying all these additional taxes
6339474 a billion here and a billion there after a while it adds up to real money
6339475 lego indiana jones has sold extremely well especially on the north american market
6339476 the result demonstrates once again the great strength of our classic product lines and the importance of combining these with new strong licenses
6339477 as the bulk of toy sales are concentrated in the closing months of the year there is still a substantial element of doubt about the overall result for the year as a whole particularly in view of the continued negative economic development
6339478 but based on the powerful momentum we are enjoying at present and our ability to keep costs under control we are optimistic about the prospects for the rest of the year

6339483 its sometimes really hard for local businesses to ensure they are talking directly to their audience

6339505 warner bros production and anticipated release of the watchmen motion picture violates 20th century foxs long standing motion picture rights in the watchmen property
6339506 we will be asking the court to enforce foxs copyright interests in the watchmen and enjoin the release of the warner bros film and any related watchmen media that violate our copyright interests in that property
6339507 it is our companys policy not to comment on pending litigation and thus will not comment on the specifics of this case
6339508 that said the courts ruling simply means that the parties will engage in discovery and proceed with the litigation
6339509 we respectfully disagree with foxs position and do not believe they have any rights in and to this project
6339510 we are not supporting any shared parking in craig avenue and that it remains a residents only scheme
6339511 since our survey earlier this year regarding parking in craig avenue and the request from the grovelands medical centre for shared daytime parking it has become clear the vast majority of residents reject the request because craig avenue has so many dropped kerb accesses to the front gardens and people feel their driveways would be blocked
6339512 several residents made constructive suggestions about alternate possibilities which would help to ease the parking situation such as two hour waiting in constitution road
6339513 we are also approaching nearby private premises with car parking to see if they might allow medical staff to park there
6339514 despite your suggestions regarding finding alternative parking for medical staff for my part i have to advise i intend to pursue whatever processes are at my disposal to achieve limited parking for patients during business hours
6339515 i will be frank something doesnt add up there are 15 residences between the chemist and directly opposite constitution road eleven of them have off road parking how is that different from western elms
6339516 there are many roads in our immediate vicinity with no off road parking and no parking restrictions whatsoever beecham road and st georges terrace to name two that leap to mind
6339517 both are closer to reading than we are and given my suggestion that i am prepared to look at one hour parking your position regarding the park and ride risk makes no sense
6339518 without banging any drums our petition has gained 1 100 signatures to date

6339525 even if i did have to sleep under the stars and had my bag nicked
6339526 we got to reading at 7am now were just hoping were in the right queue
6339527 we love going to gigs and the festival is cheap considering how many bands you get to see
6339528 we got here at 1 30am and it is now 3 30pm and i have only just got my ticket
6339529 it was a nightmare they were refusing to open the gates and people were getting pushed up against them their feet werent even touching the ground and the stewards were just looking over but not doing anything
6339530 i cannot understand why they waited until 12 30pm to open the box office people had already been here for almost 12 hours by then
6339531 they have created like a pen the queue is too wide and people are getting pushed and shoved
6339532 it was pretty horrible out there people were pushing in and i am just relieved the whole thing is over we were queuing for 12 hours but at least we got our tickets we are going to go home now and sleep and come back to enjoy the weekend tomorrow
6339533 last year i turned up at the same time and got straight to the front it is so busy this year
6339534 we are now still quite near the back but we were stood in the penned area for hours it is pretty frustrating they only have three windows selling tickets so it is just taking forever
6339535 im not even sure if we will get tickets i reckon we will be here for a good few hours yet
6339536 since most of humanity has eaten insects for most of our history on the planet not eating insects is more unusual than eating them
6339537 i dont coat insects in chocolate because that makes it a novelty i want insects to be dinner
6339538 i think its a refreshing way to start a meal
6339539 the cold makes it easier for the palate to understand that its fresh
6339540 its much harder to make hot things taste light and fresh
6339541 i like to have a chilled savory soup on the menu in summer
6339542 sugar snap peas will be coming back into season in a week or so
6339543 but you can use frozen peas or even green beans
6339544 you could even do melon soup shooters with a cheese plate

6339548 my plea to people coming to the festival is very simple
6339549 have a good time and enjoy yourselves but use your common sense and dont bring valuables like mp3 players there will be enough going on to keep you entertained without them
6339550 the festival is usually a peaceful and well organised event but we see the same issues every year with people having valuables stolen from their tents
6339551 oh no i have to figure out what to make again

6339570 we finally have enough talent on defense that we dont have to count on scoring a ton of points
6339571 we have speed maturity and were tenacious and for the first time theres depth
6339572 its the building block and springboard you want for this season
6339573 im at that point in my career where i really want to make sure we solidify ourselves as a top 20 team this year and next
6339574 i think last year we proved we could do what we have to to win games
6339575 i dont think were going to have a problem on either side of the ball
6339576 but the defense is looking like it could be the strength were a little older and developing really well
6339577 when young was out the offense controlled the ball and we led the conference in takeaways we learned how important it was to keep our offense on the field and get their offense off when camp started we were flying around like 100 000 miles an hour just playing hard and playing fast weve seen where it can take us
6339578 we like to take it one at a time and were going to do that
6339579 everything will sort itself out we feel like we owe it to ourselves to do enough to get us back to where we want and need to be
6339580 last year was tough but what we learned from that was not to leave it up to anyone else so we have to be our own committee if we win one more game then it doesnt come down to a flip of the coin
6339581 the colossal species has a reputation for being an aggressive and dangerous predator and have been feared and misrepresented in the past
6339582 my research suggests theyre not the t rex of the sea they get more docile as they mature a strange phenomenon that has caught scientists off guard
6339583 we are looking at something verging on the incredibly bizarre as she got older she got shorter and broader and was reduced to a giant gelatinous blob carrying many thousands of eggs
6339584 her shape was likely to have affected her behaviour and ability to hunt i cant imagine her jetting herself around in the water at any great speed and she was too gelatinous to have been a fighting machine
6339585 its likely she was just blobbing around the seabed carrying her brood of eggs living on dead fish while her mate was off hunting
6339586 the reality is that obtaining a mortgage which is the largest factor affecting the housing market is equally difficult in every part of the uk at present

6339601 its to come from an accident and say i can still do it if i work hard i think thats the most important thing to believe in yourself to set goals and to never give up
6339602 i had a couple of people who have said to me that it would never be possible
6339603 it was actually right after i had been in the hospital and had my amputation but a dream is about what you set for yourself and not what other people set for you
6339604 it is exceedingly hard to understand just looking at her inspires you
6339605 i would go so far as to say she should be awarded a separate medal

6339622 i looked at it as him complementing what we have
6339623 and a lot of them were with our frontline guys
6339624 im not angling for a move but if the opportunity arose before the deadline and if something were to happen and fulham give me the green light then who knows
6339625 last season wasnt good enough for myself anybody that doesnt play week in week out is obviously going to be disappointed
6339626 but its something as a footballer as a striker you become used to strikers are probably rotated more than anybody

6339634 this allows us to go forward and build the much needed public housing
6339635 the financials are down today on more negative news out of the us and the market is probably watching the reaction to babcock amp brown
6339636 some of the reports weve had out today have been slightly negative despite some coming out with higher profit theyre indicating forward earnings are coming under pressure
6339637 but our responsibility as leaders of the nation is to seriously examine what are the national consequences to our nation of this radical change in immigration policy
6339638 our first responsibility remains to unemployed australians who might want financial assistance some changes in social security laws which enable and encourage them to take up seasonal fruit picking
6339639 australians need to be reassured about health and security checks about getting the people back once they come
6339640 if australia is prepared to bring dirt poor people from pacific island nations to do work australians are unable or unwilling to do then surely we are capable of working out some financial assistance to get australians who are unemployed to help them do the work
6339641 why is it beyond the wit of our country to be able to provide the resources and encouragement in supporting australians who are unemployed to go to areas where they can get seasonal work
6339642 you simply cannot live in a city electorate and make these decisions without recognising the absolute dire circumstances that are existing in my electorate and other electorates
6339643 my growers have been trying to source australian labour for so long they are almost on their knees through drought and then theyre expected to watch their crops rot because they are not able to access labour
6339644 i think if you look in aggregate at what weve put in place as a state and in the measures that we are proposing here we are still very much at the forefront in terms of efforts to stop smoking
6339645 the effects of passive smoking are harmful especially to children and that harm increases when the child is in a confined space such as a car
6339646 one thing is certain and that is there will be point of sale changes theres going to be reform in terms of 11 or so thousand retail outlets it will not be business as usual for them and thats very very important
6339647 victoria is in catch up mode and the premier if he is really serious about fighting cancer should have brought in some of these measures over the past 12 months

6339660 surveillance efforts by chinese authorities increased dramatically over the past few days
6339661 the chinese government is petrified of these peaceful acts of defiance simply because they represent the true feelings of tibetans inside tibet
6339662 our protests are a reminder to the world of the tragic reality of the chinese governments illegitimate occupation of tibet and the urgent need for the chinese leadership to seek a resolution with the tibetan people
6339663 there were 11 injured including natives and police officers in the clashes

6339677 a kneeling man having a sword rammed through down his throat into the heart a very quick way to die
6339678 the single family numbers in this report are very much in sync with what home builders have been saying in our latest surveys
6339679 while there is definitely a sense that we are nearing the bottom of the downswing in home sales builders are not ready to start ratcheting up production just yet nor should they be until after sales begin to rebound and the inventory overhang is reduced further we anticipate that the new first time home buyer tax credit will help bring about that rebound and nahbs forecast projects that the ongoing contraction in housing starts will end in the first quarter of 2009
6339680 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
6339681 despite the macroeconomic conditions we saw improved execution in our merchandising and operations initiatives during the past quarter i am very proud of what our associates have accomplished in a difficult environment
6339682 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry
6339683 we saw relative strength in our seasonal sales as homeowners welcomed back spring and restored lawns and outdoor landscaping following the effects of last years drought in much of the country in addition we believe our second quarter sales benefited from the economic impact of the fiscal stimulus tax rebates unfortunately weakness in bigger ticket projects continues particularly in markets most impacted by the housing downturn
6339684 this is a trend we are seeing more and more being caused by dealers sales personnel not being trained properly and able to answer some of the most basic questions about what they are selling many builders and remodelers are taking it upon themselves to understand a few important lines to their business and dont rely on dealer personnel for anything beyond placing the order
6339685 dealers increasingly are trying to be all things to all people they either stock or can order sometimes more than 10 brands of windows this makes it difficult for their folks to gain a real understanding of so many brands and leaves a huge product knowledge gap
6339686 incorporating uponors radiant technology in their new building helps us achieve this goal
6339687 this new facility provides several benefits for our operations from a logistical standpoint
6339688 it is designed to be more operationally efficient and offers our employees customers and business partners convenient access from freeways as well as our corporate headquarters in apple valley

6339697 ive done it all from green building to green retail and ive been a life long environmentally conscious consumer who has tested and re tested every new product and green innovation i can find
6339698 everyone has questions about green and is looking for a way to find quick high quality answers from someone who really knows their stuff and has the expertise to back it up
6339699 environmental choices can seem complex whether youre trying to make decisions for your family or for a fortune 500 company and i should know since ive been making green decisions in both of these arenas for more than 30 years
6339700 the mission to make green home designs accessible to everyone has been the backbone of our company since its inception the fgc is a natural extension of our companys goals and perfectly timed with the new u s housing bill to encourage thought about energy efficieny and green features in new home builds
6339701 rather than prescriptively designing what we think the next green home should be we are going to ask consumers about their visions dreams and goals it is this intersection of internet scale and personal interaction which will allow us to develop new dwelling concepts that can be consumed by the masses
6339702 it does the update but then it will crash and crash thats my major problem
6339703 with the passage of crucial housing legislation last month that created an attractive home buyer tax credit there is a sense that home sales may soon be reaching a turning point
6339704 builders are anticipating the stimulative effects of this legislation and are optimistic that the tax credit will give those buyers whove been sitting on the fence the reason they need to jump back into the market
6339705 while our overall measure of builder confidence remains at a record low at this time it is a good sign that two out of three of the hmis component indexes rose in august and this may be an indication that we are nearing the bottom of the long downswing in new home sales
6339706 our current forecast shows stabilization of sales during the second half of this year followed by solid recovery in 2009 and beyond
6339707 todays hoi reading shows that 55 percent of all new and existing homes that were sold during the second quarter were affordable to families earning the national median income of 61 500
6339708 several factors combined to increase housing affordability nationwide there was a marginal rise in mortgage rates which still remain near the historically low levels of a few years ago family income nationwide held steady and lower house prices

6339721 whatever carbon gets laid down in enamel during tooth formation stays there so tooth enamel is a very good chronometer of the time of formation
6339722 and if you look at multiple teeth formed at different times you can get the age range even tighter
6339723 even though the detonations were conducted at only a few locations the elevated carbon 14 levels in the atmosphere rapidly equalized around the globe
6339724 because we eat plants and animals that live off plants the carbon 14 concentration in our bodies closely parallels that in the atmosphere at any one time

6339729 i guess if youre making 3 million a year youre middle class
6339730 its not the job of the government to define who is rich
6339731 raise taxes on your income your electric bills even your life savings
6339732 the real fault lines are over how to treat people in the highest tax brackets it gets to the heart of their economic philosophies
6339733 both tax plans take for granted a big peace dividend from ending the war in iraq
6339734 been law for eight years now and taxpayers are used to those rates
6339735 allowing them to expire would be tantamount to a massive tax increase
6339736 its skewed toward upper income americans to the exclusion of most everyone else
6339737 youre a family making less than 250 000 a year you will not see your taxes go up
6339738 over time it would mean less capital accumulated and would ultimately force wages lower
6339739 the obama tax plan is to be preferred on grounds of tax equity
6339740 and because its more fiscally responsible it is also likely to lead to better economic growth
6339741 almost everyone i know who saw it considers it to be by far the best film they saw at sundance
6339742 you want the truth right all right i got up at 12 yah 12 my masseuse brought me nuggets of course im serious though he brought me nuggets i didnt really want to go to the cafeteria so he brought me nuggets and i came straight to the track and my masseuse again brought me more nuggets i just had two though because my coach was saying i shouldnt eat so much nuggets before the race
6339743 i was looking at the replay thinking hey i look cool
6339744 ive no problem with him doing a show but i think he should show more respect and shake hands after the finish
6339745 not make gestures like the one he made in the 100m
6339746 he might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can you dont do that but hell learn hes still a young man
6339747 when he was introduced he was dancing and the crowd loves it it adds a bit of sparkle and cheer
6339748 i love to dance and show people my personality its fun and the crowd loves it
6339749 i was looking at the replay and thinking hey i look cool i was thinking wow that guy looks fast its just a great feeling
6339750 i would not compare myself to michael phelps to win eight golds nobody has done that plus i am on the track and he is in the water hes a great athlete and i congratulate him on what he has achieved
6339751 lots of people compare me to michael johnson but i do not compare myself to other people i am just trying to be myself michael johnson is a great athlete and he revolutionised the sport i just changed it a bit
6339752 usain bolt is a super human being the world has never seen anything like him

6339754 i just want to chill out and sleep i wish it was the weekend so i could chill out in some sandals but we have the 4x100m relays and i have to focus on that the boys are excited about it and i want a third gold medal
6339755 bolt must be considered now the same way like jesse owens should have been in the 1930s bolt has a bigger edge than owens on his rivals

6339869 the strength of our second quarter financial performance completes an excellent first half of 2008
6339870 following the recent decisions concerning the gronau committee recommendations by the minister of communications on august 13th we are pleased to have some initial clarity on the regulatory front although we cannot assess at this stage what will be the exact impact on the groups business results

6339872 based on the strength of our second quarter and first half 2008 financial performance and healthy cash flows from operations we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has recommended the distribution of a cash dividend to shareholders totaling nis 835 million this is in addition to the nis 679 million dividend declared last march and paid during the second quarter
6339873 while improvements during the second quarter were evident across our key profitability measures we did experience an increase in finance expenses during the second quarter primarily due to the fact that most of the groups debt is linked to the israeli consumer price index which increased 2 24 during the quarter resulting in higher financing expenses as compared to the year ago period we are pleased with the group wide performance in the first half of the year and look forward to building on these gains in the second half of 2008
