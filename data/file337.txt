3370057 maureen murphy was a true public servant and a pioneer within the illinois republican party
3370058 maureens contributions to the conservative movement in illinois will have lasting impact
3370059 as an elected official county party chairman and state central committeeman maureen served not only the republican party but the people of this state with the utmost honor and distinction

3370069 she let you know exactly how she felt about a topic

3370266 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3370267 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3370268 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

3370272 the salary levels point to a highly competitive market retailers have found that its very difficult to attract and keep the right buyers
3370273 at the same time though more and more chains are giving incentives to buyers tied to individual and company performance
3370274 all of this is occurring at a time when the buyer has taken on a far more specialized role in larger retail organizations
3370275 years ago buyers were involved in everything from product design development and sourcing to the allocation of goods to the stores today a number of those functions are handled by other departments with the buyer essentially responsible for coordinating the efforts of all those teams while understanding the needs of the stores customers
3370276 our findings confirm that turnover has been significantly reduced in the buying ranks as companies are finding ways to keep their buyers longer

3370291 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3370292 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3370293 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3370294 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3370295 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3370296 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3370297 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3370298 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3370299 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

3370306 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3370307 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

3370314 wireless consumers today understand that value is not defined by price alone a major reason our customers choose verizon wireless and stay with us is because we offer the nations most reliable network
3370315 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3370316 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3370317 a top georgian envoy in israel on sunday urged the jewish state to use whatever leverage it has to put pressure on russia to pull its forces out of the small caucasus nation but
3370318 there was an atmosphere of war about to break out from my point of view the battles of the past few days were to be expected
3370319 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3370320 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3370321 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3370322 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

3370324 like those forest fires the fiery trials we endure are forces that can produce spiritual growth in our lives god uses these experiences to refine us to be sure we are changed forever by the fires but the purifying of our hearts and minds also allows seeds of spiritual maturity to take root and grow
3370325 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3370326 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3370327 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3370328 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3370329 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3370330 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3370331 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3370332 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3370333 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3370334 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3370335 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3370336 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3370337 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3370341 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3370342 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3370343 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3370344 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3370345 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3370346 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

3370397 we are not actually cloaking anything i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon to be honest we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
3370398 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
3370399 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface its kind of weird
3370400 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker we call it a fishnet
3370401 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future youd have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material it would just send light around by sending light around the object that is to be cloaked you dont see it
3370402 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials

3370445 ce qui nest pas tout fait si bien sous linux
3370446 the chosen player has a great deal to do with how you access your music
3370447 please tell me your opinions do all mp3 players sound alike or are there true measurable differences that even the average user can appreciate if a reviewer made a mix tape of high quality music and tested it with the same good headphones on several players would they not notice a difference
3370448 no there are different grades of performance audio quality among portable audio players just as there are with any other kind on audio device they are built using different parts design etc and hence sound different as well
3370449 many players are very similar for example i believe the zune 80 and ipod classic use the same audio circuitry but theyre not all the same the soundstage is much much wider on my zune 80 than it is on my old zen vision m
3370450 i have 5 different players by different brands and they all sound different ive just done a comparison between a sony 818 and a meizu m6 both sound excellent but still have a somewhat different signature sound
3370451 like all audio i find there is a low quality range a mid quality range and a high quality range some level of predominantly sound signature difference across each range and noticeable sq differences between each range and of course the better quality your headphones iems the more youll hear the differences
3370452 ive own the following devices that play mp3 ericsson mp3 handsfree compaq ipaq 3870 motorola e630i sony ericsson k810i sony walkman nwz a816 only the motorola sounded different read crappy the rest there arent significantly different in absolute quality thus imo for the competent ones out there there are very little difference in absolute quality as opposed to sound signature but occasionally youd encounter a crappy one that you could tell right away
3370453 there are differences due to design of the final amp and how it might interact with various phones probably more effect in that latter aspect than anything else sometimes significant but usually not
3370454 im not convinced that i can recognize difference due to hardware however i can tell the differences due to different eq settings now some of these are set as default on players and cant be changed some can
3370455 the players all sound the same quality although some have more volume there is a huge difference in headphones though
3370456 to me i can certainly tell the difference when comparing older players and newer players but if im comparing to newer players like an ipod classic and a zune then there may only be a very subtle difference if any at all in the end it probably comes down to headphones speakers to me i think
3370457 there are players which have hardware and software enhancements of which have obvious differences for example
3370458 there are a few things i look at when considering a music gadget for personal use ok who am i kidding i look at everything but some key points top my list one of them is design i prefer devices that are stylish or unique in some way without sacrificing usability other necessary features include solid sound quality a customizable interface and handy features
3370459 do all mp3 players sound alike or are there true measurable differences that even the average user can appreciate if a reviewer made a mix tape of high quality music and tested it with the same good headphones on several players would they not notice a difference
3370460 thats easy enough no in more detail we test all of our mp3 players at cnet using the same selections of music which is encoded at the same bit rate in the same format we also use the same test pairs of headphones the shure se 310 earbuds and or the ultrasone hfi 700 cans in each case as reviewers we can discern a difference in sound quality among players though in many cases it is minute sure some players sound plain awful while others sound average and still others sound great but distinguishing among the great players or among the average ones is tough or sometimes impossible to do even for an experienced listener most people would not be able to tell the difference in sound quality between say the creative zen and the sony nwz 718f going a bit further its important to note that different manufacturers use different audio chips in their mp3 players even the same vendor apple for instance may use different chips among its product lines as such there is often a measurable difference among players the proof can be seen here
3370461 i am not an audiophile that knows all the terminology and definitive measurements associated with sound but i am a consumer of electronics and have tried out quite a few mp3 players over the years i primarily stick with my ultimate ears super fi 5 pro earphones and i can tell a noticeable difference in audio quality between players while the iphone does a fine job of playing audio i have to say that i have used other devices that sound clearer and louder at the same volume settings than the iphone ipod my ultimate favorite is actually the microsoft zune that blows out all the other devices i have tried after the zune i prefer the nokia n81 8gb and then the iphone it has been some time since i used my sandisk and samsung players but with the zune i really do not see a reason to try others out it is that good
3370462 i was digging around in the registry the other day looking for something unrelated and found some settings for the
3370463 i am astonished by how wonderful this makes my mp3 player sound
3370464 even if you use the very best ipod cable with your stock ipod you are still not avoiding the serious degradation of sound quality that occurs after the internal dac digital audio circuitry
3370465 determining the best sounding player is a tricky task since many of the top devices utilize the same sound chips in fact unless you have the golden ears of an audiophile its difficult to notice the difference between devices
3370466 audio quality starts with the players audio processor dsp and the audio file apples ipod nano famously use a portalplayer chip the shuffle and the samsung utilize a sigmatel chip and cowons iaudio u3 and sandisks c100 series use processors from telechips
3370467 do all mp3 players sound alike or are there true measurable differences that even the average user can appreciate if a reviewer made a mix tape of high quality music and tested it with the same good headphones on several players would they not notice a difference
3370468 i do very much disagree with that bolded statement the differences between players can be night and day however there is a small caveat here where as the night and day difference diminishes as the headphones get cheaper so when you are testing the sound quality of players with stock earbuds you may not be able to tell the difference there are many variables in what makes an mp3 player sound good but one of the core variables is the soc or audio chip this is one of the reasons many moblile phones have poor sound quality they avoid putting a real audio chip on board possibly due to cost power space reasons
3370469 i understand that to mean i cant make a div a link but i tried using spans instead and i couldnt position them properly in all browsers the nav works fine even if its not strictly valid might this have anything to do with the broken layout in ie hopefully not

3370523 a producer needs knowledge not only of the software he is using but also of music genres and how music works as a language
3370524 and of course you have to know the instruments you have to know how to play some of the instruments because at times you have to add something to make the song you are producing perfect then you also have to be creative because you have many materials you have to use and also control the artists
3370525 when you begin recording sometimes the voices dont flow and at other times everything sounds perfect some artists have funny voices so you have to listen carefully to their singing and then correct them
3370526 because these people are just after the money they rush into producing songs and at the end of the day you get a music full of mistakes you dont make a hit like that
3370527 a good producer takes his time after recording the various parts you have to sit down and begin editing this is where you have to be careful to mix instruments and voices one has to have good listening skills because you are dealing with many things at the same time

3370549 upon approval of our plans announced yesterday to transfer conseco senior health insurance company to an independent trust conseco will have completed the most significant element of its program to pursue strategic alternatives
3370550 consecos financial performance continued to stabilize in the second quarter
3370551 as the company reported profits in all four business segments conseco delivered strong growth in new business with overall sales excluding private fee for service sales growing by 8 percent bankers life sales excluding private fee for service grew 9 percent while colonial penns sales grew by 29 percent and conseco insurance group with refocused sales efforts produced higher value from new business despite lower overall sales
3370552 importantly our long term care closed block of business returned to profitability in the quarter as our efforts to strengthen reserves and improve claims management over the past year are proving successful
3370553 financial results for bankers life although improved over the first quarter were disappointing as it continued to be pressured by higher than expected initial claims in its long term care business measures implemented last quarter to address this issue including premium re rates and enhanced claims management policies and procedures will lead to improved performance over time
3370554 our investment portfolio continues to perform with earned yields meeting expectations and impairment losses significantly lower than for most life insurers on a percentage of assets basis
3370555 additionally we completed the consolidation of our chicago facilities which generated a pre tax charge of 9 6 million versus the original estimate of 15 million the consolidation will provide an annual savings of 5 million going forward
3370556 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3370557 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards

3370841 around the globe senior executives are generally more engaged than frontline managers or individual contributors
3370842 gen y disengagement levels may reflect to some extent their low seniority since more baby boomers would predictably hold leadership roles
3370843 increased engagement is an expected outcome from power and position
3370844 often they cant find what theyre looking for because they dont have the experience to know what they want lack of personal clarity can also influence engagement for gen y in particular
3370845 engaged employees are not just committed or passionate or proud
3370846 theyre enthusiastic and in gear using their talents to make a difference in their employers quest for sustainable success as a rule increased engagement results in increased productivity and performance its a key business issue leaders need to address particularly in times of economic downturn and uncertainty
3370847 developments in technology and mobile communications are enabling businesses to be flexible and respond very quickly to changes in the market place

3370853 it needs people who are self motivators driven and very bright they also need to be willing to work hard our consultants all tend to be at a more experienced senior level and thus at a different stage in their careers

3370867 the crimes committed at s21 themselves constituted a discreet widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population detained therein

3370873 the question is whether this campaign is playing to the strengths of their brand
3370874 it will certainly get people talking and it s a very dramatic change from the folksy beavers
3370875 to some degree it reflects back to the 1975 brand that was designed by jean morin in quebec with a very simple logo but unfortunately its not a particularly well rendered version of that
3370876 the financial industry has the duty of care to provide products that are appropriately designed

3370889 this is a major victory for farm animals in new jersey and will pave the way for better protections of farm animals nationwide
3370890 setting a legal precedent in a unanimous vote that clarifies that commonly used practices cannot be considered humane simply because they are widely used will build on our momentum in challenging the cruel status quo on factory farms
3370891 standards for the humane raising keeping care treatment marketing and sale of domestic livestock
3370892 having the new jersey supreme court unanimously recognize that the mutilation practices commonly used in the industry cutting off the beaks and toes of live animals without anesthesia is painful to these animals is an important milestone in educating the public at large about these practices and the need for reform
3370893 this decision will protect thousands of animals in new jersey and also calls into question some of the worst factory farm abuses practiced throughout the country
3370894 all animals deserve humane treatment including animals raised for food

3370917 ganong intentionally obstructed the issuance of a citation by going inside her residence and refusing to talk to police
3370918 i guess the cops think a 70 year old woman is a real threat
3370919 we got behind by 15 but we pressured them and we won in overtime
3370920 i was running a fever of 104 degrees and it was hard to breathe i was weak and i couldnt sweat it off
3370921 its hard because a lot of people dont understand what im going through these days nobody has heard of sarcoidosis nobody knows anything about it
3370922 i was like oh my goodness could that happen to me
3370923 the medications you take suppress your immune system and then you get staph infections fungal infections and bacterial infections
3370924 having this disease with the funny name that no one knows about you feel very isolated
3370925 i couldnt talk id be coughing so hard and itd go on for 15 or 20 minutes they kept giving me stuff and none of it would help
3370926 im sorry to see him gone but hes bringing a lot of awareness of sarcoidosis to the forefront and thats a good thing
3370927 the safety and effectiveness of the hpv vaccine gardasil as a preventive
3370928 im in good form and for the moment everything is going well
3370929 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3370930 im not sure that i faced any breakpoints today so thats really good
3370931 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve
3370932 i definitely feel more confident with every match that passes thats what winning does
3370933 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3370934 we thought it could be a very easy game for us obviously that was a misunderstanding
3370935 we had every chance to win and in the last two minutes i thought we were winning but we were too nervous by the end of the game to harvest victory
3370936 we started a little bit relaxed thinking that china wasnt a good opponent for us
3370937 we are the world champions but anyone can beat us
3370938 the final loss does hurt a little bit but it also shows we can play the world champions we can
3370939 this game prepares us for other games in the olympics players can improve quickly
3370940 the spectators have given us a chance to create a miracle however we failed
3370941 our team is a young team the spanish team are world champions we had some opportunities but we didnt grasp them
3370942 yao ming has done what he could do but he hasnt fully recovered from his foot injury thats why we couldnt completely depend on him
3370943 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3370944 some people are surprised that asian swimmers have won gold and silver at this olympics
3370945 but at this games i have won gold and silver and weve had zhang lin china win silver so we have shown the world that we can compete we got got medals and were both asian
3370946 i dont know what happened but when i looked back and saw a few smiling faces i realised i had done it
3370947 i went in with a lot of confidence because i had come second in athens but i still had to shoot my best it was a close call but at least it went in my favour
3370948 no longer will a gold medal surprise us never again will we plead with the constellations to allow luck to go our way
3370949 we want freedom and we will continue our struggle until we are free
3370950 clear interference in the internal affairs of an integral part of india
3370951 until the kashmir dispute is resolved the anti india sentiments will stay
3370952 a british rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3370953 the largest upward pressure in july came from food and non alcoholic beverages where prices rose this year but fell a year ago
3370954 within this division there were large upward effects from meat bread and cereals and vegetables
3370955 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3370956 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high of 4 4 percent in july was well above expectations
3370957 although it is difficult for the mpc to consider rate cuts while inflation is still rising it should not hesitate to cut rates later
3370958 to go significantly higher still over the coming months despite the recent retreat in oil prices
3370959 thirteen dead bodies and 15 injured have now been brought here
3370960 this is the first attack and if the operation is not stopped more attacks will be carried out you cannot imagine what atrocities the government is committing against innocent women and children

3370964 i am really enjoying the rain it has helped us all tremendously in clearing layers away we have all been going through major clearings and releases over the last month or so the intensity of it increased with the full moon last week allow yourself time sleep lots of water and to let go many old patterns fears pains and people have been coming back up in our lives do not hold onto why simply allow it to be so and then let it go the old stuff is just coming back up to be finally cleared when you hold on it doesnt clear the rain weve been having is really helping with this clearing imagine or actually stand under the rain and feel its power clearing your system and how good it feels
3370965 any side that makes the top eight can beat anyone in the top eight
3370966 the only difference is that probably melbourne and manly have been very consistent as far as their season is concerned that doesnt mean anything when it comes to a one off game in a play off the only bonus for the top four obviously is the first home semi and playing melbourne in a phone box thats a definite advantage for them
3370967 if they run eighth i wouldnt really want to play them if i ran first
3370968 theyre right up there the sides weve played recently have all been big physical sides in melbourne canberra and the knights very similar
3370969 four big games and four sides coming into the finals who probably think that they can beat us its a good test for us if were good enough to make the eight
3370970 the idea for the centre was richmond chief executive steven wrights but it is fair to say richard was extremely important in the whole process and securing the federal money
3370971 we wanted to involve the community in the centre as well as the indigenous people it has worked pretty well with the federal government and kevin rudd saying sorry it came out that indigenous people needed a bit of help and they were willing to do that
3370972 we went to canberra and it was pretty daunting a young kid coming from the bush walking into parliament house it wasnt anything i thought i would ever do
3370973 people in suits walking around luckily i took a pair of slacks and a t shirt with me and didnt walk in there in a pair of jeans and a hoodie which was good for me
3370974 it was difficult sitting there at the start but to have a background like mine not many people would guess about anything i have grown up with so it was easy to talk about because it was really just my life experience not many of these people in suits would realise something like this had happened until they saw and heard about it themselves
3370975 we were conscious richard had lived the experience first hand and after speaking to him he was very eager to be involved
3370976 at the time there were only 12 houses in the community where i grew up it was all sort of iron and pretty much chicken wire for a house there was a lot of alcohol and violence so i grew up in a fairly colourful background
3370977 i shared some of my experiences with the politicians the sports minister and simon crean and people from julia gillards office and some senators i just told them the way i grew up and what it meant to me when i had a footballer come to my school when i was 11 years old
3370978 even today i remember it clearly the day the wakelin boys came up and what that did for us as young kids
3370979 coming from an indigenous community you dont get a look in the same as a kid from say country victoria in footy terms the scouts arent looking at the kids out in the northern territory region because it is so isolated
3370980 we could build a football facility and get away with spending about 10 12 million and you would have all the footy club needs but the footy club is more than just the team
3370981 we exist to play football and win premierships but we exist because of the community so it is important we remain connected to the community and give something back to the community what we are building will help bring something to the community in particular through the indigenous learning centre
3370982 if these kids do come down it is not about bringing their talents out to make it to the elite level in football
3370983 it could be in anything not even in sport it could be girls and boys but if these kids do make it to the elite level in whatever area they want to make it in it is about personal development as much as bringing their talents to the table
3370984 it is about getting these kids to have self belief and to learn a bit and if they dont make it at an elite level they can go back to their community and become leaders back in their community and be role models in their community
3370985 hopefully i can relate to a few of them and tell them a bit about my background and what i had to go through it wasnt laid out on the table you had to take it and most of these kids dont believe they can coming from a community they are shy they dont have much self belief and confidence
3370986 the number of reports of similar named drugs is increasing and the number of different products implicated in medication errors is increasing
3370987 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3370988 we are pulling out all the stops to deliver a more efficient package for customers who need the capability of full size pickups and suvs and want the very best fuel economy
3370989 our pickups and suvs are already the fuel economy leaders of their respective segments but our engineers knew greater efficiency was achievable we fast tracked the xfe models to get them into dealer showrooms as quickly as possible
3370990 shes a once in a generation type of athlete who is exceptionally gifted in her particular event
3370991 she can do some things in training that youve never seen before so its exciting working with her
3370992 it probably is a weight off my shoulders and a bit of a relief but the 200 is a completely different race and there is still another final of girls who would love to win a gold medal
3370993 i will just have to refocus after this go back home and no matter how exciting it is still remember that ive got another race
3370994 based on everything ive seen theres not anyone who can catch her in the back 50
3370995 she didnt do much work to get down there i was pretty confident that she had got down there pretty comfortably
3370996 i pretty much lost it when i saw rohan i think i made rohan cry as well
3370997 i was probably tearing up a bit behind the dais but just got through it and once i saw my mum i pretty much lost it
3370998 its about being out there and winning games and championships thats where we will be judged ultimately by our success on the field
3370999 we are winning a lot of friends out there more than 50 of our members are afl members so we dont see ourselves competing with footy
3371000 one of the big challenges for us is to find extra money
3371001 the environment is certainly different to last year and theres a lot of competition for corporate support but that just means we have to work even harder
3371002 on memberships we are behind where we were last year but there are a couple of differences
3371003 we are not at home until round three so we are still optimistic that we can get to last years numbers
3371004 if we play like we played this week well beat australia
3371005 weve got a couple of big series coming up that are taking up most of our thinking at the moment but were certainly very aware that in 12 months time well have an ashes series on the go and were very much looking forward to it
3371006 without wanting to put too much on paper i reckon it is interesting that hes coming out and saying that already there are obviously some things they need to work on it was a dead rubber and if they want to win the ashes theyve got to win two more tests than they won in this series against us in england next year
3371007 ive definitely done a bit of thinking about australia next year
3371008 certainly a lot more than i would have if i was a player its about getting the structure right for a long amount of time so the players can feel comfortable and know their role and deliver
3371009 steve harmison is hugely important to the australia series i said to steve i want you to open the bowling to bowl fast to bowl straight to be the old steve harmison and as an extra responsibility to get some runs at nine he said he would do his best his best has been good enough this week
3371010 being england captain will take up more time than he can imagine and he will need to reconsider his whole outlook
3371011 within the game he has a reputation as being an individual but to be successful a leader must be a giver not a taker to his team fringe players sponsors the public everyone hopefully his captaincy will be similar to his batting positive instinctive and entertaining
3371012 successful launch of these products by our customer will be an important milestone in the history of our company and will qualify us as a service provider to pharmaceutical companies engaged in sales and marketing of prescription products this is in line with our initiative to internally develop pharmaceutical products and partner with pharmaceutical companies to bring the products to market
3371013 come on now give it your best shot maybe then itll be a real battle so get off your ass and fight me

3371018 up until age 13 there is the ability to transfer language processing from the left to the right hemisphere of the brain
3371019 so our anticipation of recovery of certain very distinct brain functions is much more optimistic for children
3371020 there are slight delays in getting language off the ground but their progress is pretty similar to the typically developing children

3371026 my approach is to take the results of other trials into consideration there are now 25 randomized trials showing that ischemic events related to atherosclerosis will be reduced with lipid lowering therapy
3371027 so it seems valid when we find a reduction in coronary bypass surgery in our treated patients the evidence from other trials gives plausibility to our secondary end point findings
3371028 they were people who today are not normally considered candidates for ldl cholesterol lowering therapy
3371029 but the finding we made was that a large proportion of these patients actually did have a high risk of developing atherosclerotic disease the patients who received the cholesterol lowering treatment benefited from less complicated surgery and less atherosclerotic disease so what we learned is to focus more on atherosclerosis in a patient population with aortic disease
3371030 at a stage of aortic disease where they had passed the limit of no return so to speak
3371031 chrysler is negotiating with the uaw to get 10 hour days four days a week

3371033 he or she can spend more time with their family theyre not driving as much so they can save fuel themselves
3371034 i would think a majority of our employees given the option would be in favor of it
3371035 it means that a plant is producing a product for which there is little demand
3371036 as an early stage of trying to shut down these plants it can only be interpreted as very discouraging news
3371037 if brain damage related to alzheimers disease begins earlier in adult life then having less reserve due to a smaller brain could compromise intellectual ability in those destined to get alzheimers and lead to them getting less education
3371038 technically reading a book and returning it is theft of knowledge
3371039 i dont advocate making a habit of buying new books reading them and returning them but once in a while i do think mass returns are a useful form of consumer protest
3371040 they took back my book with no problem got into a discussion with the cashier about how i was the 15th person to bring my book back today
3371041 i can tell you that its certainly my experience that most stores will absolutely accept returns provided the books are in good condition

3371045 there are things that we did with watchmen that could only work in a comic
3371046 lets just make some versions of that with photoshop magic and re create them almost exactly

3371050 we need to get those people working thats the bottom line
3371051 only the biggest apple fans or microsoft haters believe you have to eliminate microsoft to defeat them
3371052 jobs is arguably unique in the extent to which his identity and fate are intertwined with those of his company
3371053 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3371054 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3371055 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3371056 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3371057 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3371058 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3371059 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3371060 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3371061 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at his wife rhonda
3371062 she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired
3371063 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3371064 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3371065 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3371066 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3371067 he represented a kind of hood attitude and cultural phenomenon that was under exploited in america but had great potential
3371068 he was always honest and that honesty was what he exuded and what made him so great
3371069 its a terrible loss i mean you need funny in your life at all times he was definitely one who brought it one of the best comedians ive ever really experienced and condolences go out to everyone in his family
3371070 bernie is just ridiculous with it or he was so god bless his family god bless his soul but bernie was that dude for real so rest in peace man
3371071 you know john edwards life would be a lot easier today if several months ago he had asked ted kennedy to drive ms hunter home some night yep cold and cruel you bet but dont respond with the usual whining and complaining the only person who ever stood between fat head ted and the white house was mary jo kopechne
3371072 there are very few people driving to this festival its a huge mass transit event and i think that alone must save a tremendous amount of fuel and help from an emissions standpoint
3371073 i think its great how transportation by ferry is being so encouraged
3371074 and they made it really hard to get parking passes so that keeps it green
3371075 the line was so long i was like what is this
3371076 that takes a lot of extra effort and extra money but the artists were very conscious about not throwing stuff away
3371077 were not adding tons of plastic and paper plates backstage but its a small thing and theres probably a ways to go there
3371078 my girlfriend drives a hybrid and i quit turning my lights on when i go to the restroom
3371079 these artists are out there not to beat people over the head but to increase awareness of a lot of different issues
3371080 in a pretty easy way it creates a little consciousness about what happens when you throw it away
3371081 lets pick it all up lets get a little reward for doing so and it will also keep the grounds looking a lot nicer for everyone throughout the weekend
3371082 not like the writers and producers at motown or quincy jones but he was on that level in my opinion
3371083 he gave me my voice he taught me showed me and nurtured my voice he didnt teach me how to sing he taught me how to be a better singer that was isaac
3371084 he didnt have a choreographer he didnt have a show
3371085 isaac would just get up there and sit down and become one with the song he was doing and you would look out and the women would be hanging on every word it made me wish my voice was that deep
3371086 i met isaac hayes when i was on the road with james brown in the 70s
3371087 we played a few festivals together in my later years i got to know the man behind the music he was the first official black man to be known as a real rapper and he had nothing but praise for his queens and women of the world
3371088 hayes was so musically advanced and timeless in his compositions he was loved and appreciated by so many he was an enduring symbol of the struggle of the african american man and was a shining example of soul at its best
3371089 although he was under the weather he was still performing
3371090 he was the man he had the show must go on spirit in his absence he will be remembered through his great music he will forever be in our hearts and souls
3371091 i am deeply saddened by the loss of isaac hayes a true historic world music figure
3371092 isaac hayes was the first african american to win an oscar for a music score but never lost sight of his commitment to his community and the betterment of mankind he was more than an artist he was a trailblazer he was an innovator
3371093 i tried to be as real as i possibly could
3371094 and i keyed in on the character shaft the character himself
3371095 i think the songs out there today when the kids talk about romance i think theyre too blatant they dont leave enough for the imagination
3371096 i like to use metaphors thats right and take it slow and easy and then build its kind of like foreplay you dont want to get there too soon else its all over its like eating candy just gobbling it down and then i want some more and its gone you have to savor it
3371097 joss is a big supporter of barack obama and was very excited to be asked to do this for him he sent a personal message asking her to get on board
3371098 the tamone temple complex composed of the temples of tamone toch and tamone thom and located in the phnom dang rek range is clearly situated in the cambodian territory
3371099 cambodia rejects any claim contrary to the legal rights of the kingdom
3371100 the thai troops are guarding a gate to the temple and cambodian soldiers are standing just outside the gate
3371101 when vanity is not prompting us we have little to say

3371145 the bottom line is there are still offerings out there but most of the action we see is with siebel on premise or oracle on demand
3371146 theres not enough independent validation that that stuff meets the bar those offerings cant keep pace with siebel or oracle on demand or the rest of the market for that matter

3371290 they always pass these authorizations with a lot of fanfare as if they are going to spend the money immediately but a lot of these bond bills are over five or ten years

3371299 my whole summer was about waiting for us to start school
3371300 youre what we want because you love what youve been doing all these years you love the community these kids come from and you know what it is going to take to turn these kids perceptions around about what they are capable of
3371301 when i went to rio i was an average student
3371302 but i wanted to go to law school dont ask me how i came to that decision or why but i said i wanted to be lawyer i went to see my counselor and she took a look at my college entrance scores and said college isnt for you she actually told me that i should go apply at the local piggly wiggly grocery store down the street no student should ever be given that kind of advice none
3371303 it was my dream to be a principal of a school

3371312 held sen pete domenici accountable for rubberstamping bushs failed policies 92 percent of the time as well as reps steve pearce and heather wilson who voted in lockstep with bush 91 percent and 66 percent of the time respectively according to congressional quarterly
3371313 they want to distance themselves from him and our point is you cant distance yourself if you voted for his policies and they need to be held accountable as well

3371326 we will provide that person at an early enough stage to make sure a project can be delivered it is the kind of person not everyone wants to hire full time as opportunities to do these projects only come up every so often it is understandable why some of the bigger independent companies dont have people in place to do that but what they need to be able to do as they do with tv is identify people and hire them in when they need them

3371329 people say that casual games is in its infancy but i think the industry acts more like a freshman at college
3371330 casual games isnt quite sure what it wants to be when it grows up but if it had to pick it would pick everything
3371331 the casual game label is getting awfully broad encompassing everything from the wii and ds to flash games downloadables mobile games and rock band and guitar hero while that can make the casual game industry look really impressive its not clear that all those games really fit under the same umbrella they may need to find more specialized terms soon if the casual bandwagon gets too crowded or confusing
3371332 pirates are still the biggest group of casual game downloaders according to our numbers
3371333 and as far as to who is buying them most of the buyers are still the female over 35 group that has become so commonly quoted our own internal surveys havent refuted that information
3371334 however the casual consumer is becoming more sophisticated in their tastes a simple match 3 game might do well on a cell phone where youre looking for a few minutes of fun in between other things but thats not what youre going to seek out to download for me time
3371335 thats why time management hidden object simulation and adventure games are the big winners today theyre immersive experiences rather than amusing momentary distractions
3371336 certainly the key drivers to the market right now are hidden object games and click management games

3371360 die digitalisierung von kulturwerken kann den europ ern zugang zu den best nden ausl ndischer museen bibliotheken und archive geben ohne dass sie sich dazu auf reisen begeben oder in hunderten von seiten nach der gew nschten information bl ttern m ssen
3371361 die europeana bibliothek wird den menschen einen schnellen und einfachen zugang zu europ ischen b chern und kunstwerken bieten ob im heimatland oder im ausland
3371362 aber obwohl die mitgliedsstaaten bei der verbreitung des kulturguts ber das internet schon gro e fortschritte gemacht haben sind noch mehr ffentliche und private investitionen erforderlich um die digitalisierung weiter zu beschleunigen
3371363 ich m chte erreichen dass die europeana bibliothek mit vielf ltigen inhalten noch vor jahresende er ffnet wird
3371364 die europeana hat zur zeit noch das problem dass der stand der digitalisierung in den einzelnen mitgliedsstaaten sehr unterschiedlich ist
3371365 die kostenfrage ist in diesem zusammenhang nat rlich ein wesentlicher faktor zum jetzigen zeitpunkt kann noch niemand genau sagen was der digitalisierungsprozess letztendlich kosten wird
3371366 zeitschriften sind nicht nur ein kulturgut sondern auch ein konsumgut als solches sind sie wie viele andere branchen auch direkt vom verf gbaren budget der haushalte abh ngig

3371385 higher transportation costs must be factored into the entire supply chain from the sourcing of raw materials used in the manufacturing process to the ocean and inland costs of transportation of the finished product as it moves from the factory to retail outlets on that scale latin america and especially mexico rank favorably manufacturers of products that include petroleum plastic or steel have made mexico a popular location for new or expanded production because those raw materials can be sourced competitively in mexico although wages in mexico are higher than in asia they are still much lower than in the united states in addition mexicos proximity to the u s market cuts down on transportation costs especially for bulky products such as appliances central america and the northern rim of south america also enjoy a time advantage in comparison with asia the faster delivery time can be important for producers of fashion items and apparel that change with the seasons

3371388 water has no colour no race no nationality it is the same all over the world
3371389 getting the location right is a big challenge particularly in the uk where onshore turbines tend to be located on ridges or hills
3371390 when you are working on a ridge for example the wind flow and turbulence can be very different just 100m further down the ridge and the current approaches are just too simple to detect those differences
3371391 sodars use a loud speaker to send out beeps of noise into the atmosphere
3371392 those sound waves get reflected back by wind flow and temperature variations and that gives you a good idea of where the turbulence is if you use three speakers you can get a 3d view ranging from a height of 20m to 300m from that you can work out the best location and height for the turbine and get a measure of how much strain the turbines will have to face
3371393 weve worked out a signal processing mechanism that means that instead of sending out uniform beeps we can send out sound at different frequencies and then analyse its behaviour
3371394 it allows us to get much richer data from each pulse of sound and results in five times as many data points
3371395 our investment to purchase these state of the art photovoltaic solar energy systems for both staples center and nokia theater la live making them the first facilities of their kind to do so at this level reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that our venues are the most environmentally friendly in the industry
3371396 a federal appeals court has ruled that a ski resorts plan to use recycled wastewater for making snow would not violate the religious freedom of indian groups who had claimed that the practice would be blasphemous to a mountain they hold sacred the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruling in a lawsuit against the arizona snowbowl near flagstaff that was filed by 13 tribes and the sierra club overturned a ruling by a smaller panel of the court that said the plan would violate the religious freedom restoration act
3371397 in the most recent ruling the court found that using reclaimed sewer water to make snow for skiing on an admittedly sacred site posed no substantial burden on the plaintiffs exercise of religion in this case
3371398 only effect of the proposed upgrades is on the plaintiffs subjective emotional religious experience that is the presence of recycled wastewater on the peaks is offensive to the plaintiffs religious sensibilities the diminishment of spiritual fulfillment serious though it may be is not a substantial burden on the free exercise of religion

3371404 ill be damned if i know but i believe in the free and responsible search for truth and meaning in other words ill spend my life trying to figure it out and i believe in the acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in my congregation so i have the assistance of others on a similar quest to figure it out why i was born
3371405 i am committed to the inherent worth and dignity of every person and the goal of world community with peace liberty and justice for all i cannot rest until all people are held up and acknowledged as human beings of dignity and worth and we have created heaven on earth
3371406 i dont know but i have a respect for the interdependent web of all existence of which i am a part and i know and accept that death is part of the natural life cycle and all living things die and are transformed in some way and continue to be part of the universe which is beautiful and mysterious and fills me with awe

3371411 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia these actions would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began on august 6th
3371412 the goal of this operation is not only to seize and annex part of georgian territory but they clearly said that the goal of this operation is regime change in georgia the change of a democratically elected government of georgia

3371438 i believe that if the united states government wanted the genocide in darfur to end it would end that the united states government and the chinese government are certainly the two most powerful governments in the world and it is hard for me to believe that if they wanted omar al bashir to stop killing his own people that they couldnt bring that about
3371439 i dont think china is required to address every conflict thats going on in the world right now im not asking china to intercede on iraq or afghanistan china is paying for a genocide it gives the government of sudan 2 billion a year and thats what the government uses to kill its own people to buy the guns and the planes to hire the janjaweed and then china also sells the weaponry that allows the government to kill its own people so this olympic host is complicit in the genocide its underwriting it its the financier its the arms supplier it is not playing a neutral role and we are pointing out the inconsistency of an olympic host presenting itself as a leader for peace by being an olympic host while being complicit in a genocide
3371440 our protest has been online weve been broadcasting the darfur olympics its at darfurolympics org its a daily webcast from american actress mia farrow at a darfur refugee camp talking about different issues there today our topic is about the olympics itself and shes talked about what the refugees think about the olympics on our website

3371444 we believe that it will follow the hype cycle and following initial disillusionment progress eventually to large scale shifts in creating intellectual capital and decision making
3371445 the problem with supply chains is that many are still organised in silos and if you cut carbon in one of these areas you can end up increasing emissions in another area
3371446 we are all aware of the idea that you can cut emissions from flights by importing flowers from the netherlands instead of africa for example but now studies have shown african flowers have a lower overall carbon footprint as they do not require heated glasshouses

3371494 in preparing for this competition we just focused on ourselves and did not give much thought to the others
3371495 i didnt try one of the more difficult actions on the pommel horse although it can and add 0 1 points to my score

3371525 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling

3371549 university politics are so vicious precisely because the stakes are so small lanzaspud wrote its been spouted around on here lately that fgers dont take enough part or pride in the commemoration of their leaders and significant figures from irish history particularly men from the anglo irish tensions and the early days of the free state we seem to be only seen to commemorate michael collins just wanted to start a thread to remember the man and statesman who was an integral part of the foundation of this democratic and peaceful state that we now know today arthur griffith who died on this day in 1922 as a result of a brain haemorrhage griffith played a paramount role in the anglo irish treaty negotiations which altered the course of irish history as we know forever i feel its important that his contribution to the irish cause is not overlooked and that he can be remembered by irishmen today for the overwhelming work he did in the name of ireland he represented the neccesary more moderate voice of irish republicanism minus the perhaps overmoderate approach of the ipp in the words of collins himself in arthur griffith there is a mighty force in ireland he has none of the wildness of some i could name instead there is an abundance of wisdom and an awareness of things which are ireland

3371608 the sensor can be integrated into a specially designed lab on a chip or microchip assay and preprogrammed to bind a specific protein of interest generating a sustained fluorescent signal as the molecules attach a microscope then reads the intensity of the fluorescent light a measure of the proteins cumulative concentration in the saliva sample and scientists gauge whether it corresponds with levels linked to developing disease
3371609 in their initial experiments the scientists primed the optical protein sensor to detect the il 8 protein which at higher than normal concentration in saliva is linked to oral cancer using saliva samples from 20 people half healthy the others diagnosed with oral cancer the sensor correctly distinguished in all cases between health and disease importantly the sensor achieved a limit of detection for il 8 that is roughly 100 times more sensitive than todays blood based enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa tests the standard technique to measure protein in bodily fluid
3371610 because saliva has a lower concentration of proteins than blood does the team needed a highly sensitive method to detect the tagged proteins among the background noise stray molecules in saliva that also fluoresce so the researchers used a confocal microscope an imaging system that employs a laser to collect the light generated from a sample to analyze the saliva ho and his team found that focusing the laser light on a specific part of the sample resulted in a lower signal to noise ratio allowing them to detect lower concentrations of the cancer biomarker indeed ho says the device is 100 times more sensitive than the standard protein detection technique elisa
3371611 the ultra sensitive optical protein sensor presented in this paper has a wide number of applications in disease diagnoses measurements for detecting biomarkers in clinical sample are much more challenging than the measurements in buffer due to high background noise contributed by large collections of non target molecules we used clinical saliva samples to validate the functionality of the optical protein sensor clinical detection of disease specific biomarkers in saliva offers a non invasive alternative approach to using blood or urine

3371613 he and his team have already developed a saliva test for oral cancer and sjogrens syndrome a systemic disease in which the bodys immune system attacks the glands that produce saliva and tears dr wong says they have promising early evidence that it will be possible perhaps even within five years to use saliva to detect biomarkers for more systemic diseases like breast lung and pancreatic cancers as well as diabetes
3371614 the benefits of saliva testing versus blood sampling or more invasive diagnostic tests are many says dr wong saliva testing is easier safer and less intrusive since its testing does not require specially trained personnel there is no risk of exposing anyone to blood born diseases also oral fluids do not clot like blood so they not require the same level of manipulation

3371784 num dia em que os filhos de deus vieram apresentar se perante o senhor veio tamb m satan s entre eles ent o perguntou o senhor a satan s donde vens satan s respondeu ao senhor e disse de rodear a terra e passear por ela perguntou ainda o senhor a satan s observaste o meu servo j porque ningu m h na terra semelhante a ele homem ntegro e reto temente a deus e que se desvia do mal
3371785 ent o respondeu satan s ao senhor porventura j debalde teme a deus acaso n o o cercaste com sebe a ele a sua casa e a tudo quanto tem a obra de suas m os aben oaste e os seus bens se multiplicaram na terra estende por m a m o e toca lhe em tudo quanto tem e ver s se n o blasfema contra ti na tua face disse o senhor a satan s eis que tudo quanto ele tem est em teu poder somente contra ele n o estendas a m o e satan s saiu da presen a do senhor
3371786 do c u olha o senhor para os filhos dos homens para ver se h quem entenda se h quem busque a deus todos se extraviaram e juntamente se corromperam n o h quem fa a o bem n o h nem um sequer

3371788 n o te lembres dos meus pecados da mocidade nem das minhas transgress es lembra te de mim segundo a tua miseric rdia por causa da tua bondade senhor
3371789 ent o saiu satan s da presen a do senhor e feriu a j de tumores malignos desde a planta do p at ao alto da cabe a j sentado em cinza tomou um caco para com ele raspar se ent o sua mulher lhe disse ainda conservas a tua integridade amaldi oa a deus e morre mas ele lhe respondeu falas como qualquer doida temos recebido o bem de deus e n o receber amos tamb m o mal em tudo isto n o pecou j com os seus l bios
3371790 porque deus amou ao mundo de tal maneira que deu o seu filho unig nito para que todo o que nele cr n o pere a mas tenha a vida eterna porquanto deus enviou o seu filho ao mundo n o para que julgasse o mundo mas para que o mundo fosse salvo por ele
3371791 de maneira diferente dos outros invasores os filisteus eram civilizados e n o se mostravam terrivelmente opressivos por conseguinte israel relaxou sob o dom nio dos filisteus e n o invocou o senhor

3371816 americans wishing to spend august vacationing with their families or watching the olympics may wonder why their newspapers and television screens are filled with images of war in the small country of georgia concerns about what occurs there might seem distant and unrelated to the many other interests america has around the world and yet russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states of america
3371817 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable that makes russias recent actions against the georgians all the more alarming in the face of russian aggression the very existence of independent georgia and the survival of its democratically elected government are at stake
3371818 we are looking at a cold cold winter in upstate new york
3371819 george bush and big oil special interests killed this responsible drilling bill because they werent satisfied with their record profits
3371820 if mr massa is serious about disagreeing with speaker pelosi maybe he should put his money where his mouth is and return the 14 000 in campaign contributions hes received from pelosi
3371821 otherwise his statement is just deceptive hypocritical and highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress the bottom line is a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic led congress
3371822 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling
3371823 its one of the limitations on his powers he cannot establish the agenda and the agenda is set by the majority party which brings it all right back to the speaker
3371824 the whole reason i did this was so my wife wouldnt have to work anymore and if i could make enough money so that my wife could just stay home with our children especially with the new baby that would give me an incredible sense of accomplishment i just cant believe it
3371825 the moment after i walked out of the quiz i knew

3371844 women are looking for examples from other women about how they balance the pressures and responsibilities of family and work
3371845 fortunately ups has been able to develop women to take leadership roles in our latin american business and with wld we are addressing the issue directly around the world
3371846 communist goals 1963 and see what you find gorbachev was a student of the manulisky school for political warfare manuliskys most famous quote is
3371847 war to the hilt between communism and capitalism is inevitable today of course we are not strong enough to attack our time will come in thirty to forty years to win we shall need the element of surprise the bourgeoisie will have to be put to sleep so we shall begin by launching the most spectacular peace movement on record there will be electrifying overtures and unheard of concessions the capitalist countries stupid and decadent will rejoice to cooperate in their own destruction they will leap at another chance to be friends as soon as their guard is down we will smash them with our clenched fist

3371886 there are some things that are forbidden but when something offends us we need to be careful to discern whether the scripture actually forbids it or whether we just find it unusual and acceptable in our own thinking
3371887 as long as it does not contradict scripture then it must be from god
3371888 lifting jesus high bringing biblical light to your questions about the lakeland outpouring amp todd bentley june 8 2008
3371889 while its good and right and biblical to test the spirits to see if they are of god its vital to realize that just because a type of vision or a sign is not listed in scripture that its unscriptural to be discounted or false
3371890 we have no account of miracles like amputated limbs growing back but the absence of this is scripture doesnt mean that such a miracle unbiblical
3371891 to apply doctrine to the response of god in our lives is wrong
3371892 if a person is of the mind set that everything spiritual that happens or manifests in our lives has to be found in scripture to be divine and of god then that standard or belief would have to be applied to every area of ones life

3371940 because of the large uncertainty we have in the radiative forcing of aerosols there is a corresponding large uncertainty in the degree of radiative forcing overall
3371941 this introduces a large uncertainty in the degree of warming predicted by climate change models
3371942 this fact has seemingly surprised a number of progressive people who are bemoaning obamas shift to the center its sad that some who seek progressive change are missing the forest for the trees
3371943 but they will not dampen the wide and deep enthusiasm for blocking a third bush term represented by john mccain or for bringing obama by a landslide into the white house with a large democratic congressional majority
3371944 the struggle to defeat the ultra right and turn our country on a positive path will not end with obamas election
3371945 but that step will shift the ground for successful struggles going forward
3371946 one thing is clear none of the peoples struggles from peace to universal health care to an economy that puts main street before wall street will advance if mccain wins in november lets keep our eyes on the prize
3371947 it was not an endorsement and i have no further comment
3371948 obamas hope change and unity campaign because they see in it the thrilling opportunity to end 30 years of ultra right rule and move our nation forward with a broadly progressive agenda
3371949 at the core are americas working families of all hues and ethnicities whose determination to move forward does not depend on and will not be diverted by the daily twists and turns of this watershed presidential campaign they are taking the long view
3371950 if obamas candidacy represented nothing more than the spark for this profound initiative to unite the working class and defeat the pernicious influence of racism it would be a transformative candidacy that would advance progressive politics for the long term

3372010 but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion for them
3372011 36 but when he saw the multitudes he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd
3372012 14 and jesus went forth and saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion toward them and he healed their sick
3372013 40 and there came a leper to him beseeching him and kneeling down to him and saying unto him if thou wilt thou canst make me clean 41 and jesus moved with compassion put forth his hand and touched him and saith unto him i will be thou clean
3372014 1 and they came over unto the other side of the sea into the country of the gadarenes 2 and when he was come out of the ship immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit 3 who had his dwelling among the tombs and no man could bind him no not with chains 4 because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains and the chains had been plucked asunder by him and the fetters broken in pieces neither could any man tame him 5 and always night and day he was in the mountains and in the tombs crying and cutting himself with stones 6 but when he saw jesus afar off he ran and worshipped him 7 and cried with a loud voice and said what have i to do with thee jesus thou son of the most high god i adjure thee by god that thou torment me not 8 for he said unto him come out of the man thou unclean spirit 9 and he asked him what is thy name and he answered saying my name is legion for we are many 10 and he besought him much that he would not send them away out of the country 11 now there was there nigh unto the mountains a great herd of swine feeding 12 and all the devils besought him saying send us into the swine that we may enter into them 13 and forthwith jesus gave them leave and the unclean spirits went out and entered into the swine and the herd ran violently down a steep place into the sea they were about two thousand and were choked in the sea 14 and they that fed the swine fled and told it in the city and in the country and they went out to see what it was that was done 15 and they come to jesus and see him that was possessed with the devil and had the legion sitting and clothed and in his right mind and they were afraid 16 and they that saw it told them how it befell to him that was possessed with the devil and also concerning the swine 17 and they began to pray him to depart out of their coasts 18 and when he was come into the ship he that had been possessed with the devil prayed him that he might be with him 19 howbeit jesus suffered him not but saith unto him go home to thy friends and tell them how great things the lord hath done for thee and hath had compassion on thee 20 and he departed and began to publish in decapolis how great things jesus had done for him and all and it came to pass the day after that he went into a city called nain and many of his disciples went with him and much people 12 now when he came nigh to the gate of the city behold there was a dead man carried out the only son of his mother and she was a widow and much people of the city was with her 13 and when the lord saw her he had compassion on her and said unto her weep not 14 and he came and touched the bier and they that bare him stood still and he said young man i say unto thee arise 15 and he that was dead sat up and began to speak and he delivered him to his mother
3372015 30 and behold two blind men sitting by the way side when they heard that jesus passed by cried out saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david 31 and the multitude rebuked them because they should hold their peace but they cried the more saying have mercy on us o lord thou son of david 32 and jesus stood still and called them and said what will ye that i shall do unto you 33 they say unto him lord that our eyes may be opened 34so jesus had compassion on them and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed him
3372016 37 then saith he unto his disciples the harvest truly is plenteous but the labourers are few 38 pray ye therefore the lord of the harvest that he will send forth labourers into his harvest
3372017 1 and when he had called unto him his twelve disciples he gave them power against unclean spirits to cast them out and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease 2 now the names of the twelve apostles are these the first simon who is called peter and andrew his brother james the son of zebedee and john his brother 3 philip and bartholomew thomas and matthew the publican james the son of alphaeus and lebbaeus whose surname was thaddaeus 4 simon the canaanite and judas iscariot who also betrayed him 5 these twelve jesus sent forth and commanded them saying go not into the way of the gentiles and into any city of the samaritans enter ye not 6 but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of israel 7 and as ye go preach saying the kingdom of heaven is at hand
3372018 9 but as touching brotherly love ye need not that i write unto you for ye yourselves are taught of god to love one another
3372019 34 and jesus when he came out saw much people and was moved with compassion toward them because they were as sheep not having a shepherd and he began to teach them many things
3372020 15 but sanctify the lord god in your hearts and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear
3372021 45 philip findeth nathanael and saith unto him we have found him of whom moses in the law and the prophets did write jesus of nazareth the son of joseph 46 and nathanael said unto him can there any good thing come out of nazareth philip saith unto him come and see
3372022 24 and the morrow after they entered into c sarea and cornelius waited for them and had called together his kinsmen and near friends

3372046 emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities are changing the atmosphere in ways that affect the earths climate
3372047 the evidence is incontrovertible global warming is occurring if no mitigating actions are taken significant disruptions in the earths physical and ecological systems social systems security and human health are likely to occur we must reduce emissions of greenhouse gases beginning now

3372050 but how is he going to bring this back to music
3372051 dont let your hearts be troubled trust in god and trust also in me there is more than enough room in my fathers home if this were not so would i have told you that i am going to prepare a place for you when everything is ready i will come and get you so that you will always be with me where i am and you know the way to where i am going
3372052 so he took me in the spirit to a great high mountain and he showed me the holy city jerusalem descending out of heaven from god it shone with the glory of god and sparkled like a precious stone like jasper as clear as crystal the city wall was broad and high with twelve gates guarded by twelve angels and the names of the twelve tribes of israel were written on the gates there were three gates on each side east north south and west the wall of the city had twelve foundation stones and on them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the lamb
3372053 no longer will there be a curse upon anything for the throne of god and of the lamb will be there and his servants will worship him and they will see his face and his name will be written on their foreheads and there will be no night there no need for lamps or sun for the lord god will shine on them and they will reign forever and ever
3372054 the spirit and the bride say come let anyone who hears this say come let anyone who is thirsty come let anyone who desires drink freely from the water of life
3372055 the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field in his excitement he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field
3372056 again the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant on the lookout for choice pearls when he discovered a pearl of great value he sold everything he owned and bought it
3372057 the seed that fell among the thorns represents those who hear gods word but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life and the lure of wealth so no fruit is produced
3372058 jesus told him if you want to be perfect go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven then come follow me but when the young man heard this he went away sad for he had many possessions
3372059 no one can serve two masters for you will hate one and love the other you will be devoted to one and despise the other you cannot serve both god and money
3372060 dont store up treasures here on earth where moths eat them and rust destroys them and where thieves break in and steal store your treasures in heaven where moths and rust cannot destroy and thieves do not break in and steal wherever your treasure is there the desires of your heart will also be
3372061 a rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops he said to himself what should i do i dont have room for all my crops then he said i know ill tear down my barns and build bigger ones then ill have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods and ill sit back and say to myself my friend you have enough stored away for years to come now take it easy eat drink and be merry but god said to him you fool you will die this very night then who will get everything you worked for yes a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with god
3372062 god blesses those who are humble for they will inherit the whole earth
3372063 i am the way the truth and the life no one can come to the father except through me
3372064 come you who are blessed by my father inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world for i was hungry and you fed me i was thirsty and you gave me a drink i was a stranger and you invited me into your home i was naked and you gave me clothing i was sick and you cared for me i was in prison and you visited me
3372065 god blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers be happy about it be very glad for a great reward awaits you in heaven
3372066 god blesses those who are persecuted for doing right for the kingdom of heaven is theirs
3372067 you know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people and officials flaunt their authority over those under them but among you it will be different whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave for even the son of man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many
3372068 and if you give even a cup of cold water to one of the least of my followers you will surely be rewarded
3372069 i assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property for my sake and for the good news will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses brothers sisters mothers children and property along with persecution and in the world to come that person will have eternal life but many who are the greatest now will be least important then and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then
3372070 that is what the scriptures mean when they say no eye has seen no ear has heard and no mind has imagined what god has prepared for those who love him
3372071 for god loved the world so much that he gave his one and only son so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life
3372072 we knew that we were going to face the best players in the world
3372073 it was a lot of fun even though it was very hard because they pressed us a lot you just have to take a lot of good things from this game because they are the best
3372074 what i will remember is the play in the second quarter the usa was on a fastbreak and somebody passed the ball to lebron and he dunked it with his left hand it think it was amazing
3372075 the most important thing in life is to learn how to give out love and to let love come in love is the only rational act

3372085 atlanta is well known throughout the country as being a solid soccer city filled with talented players and enthusiastic fans so weve had our eye on atlanta as an expansion market for many months
3372086 the league is fortunate to have fitz on board as we will certainly tap his enthusiasm and business savvy during our inaugural season
3372087 wps has proven itself to be a smart business venture with a conservative business plan built on realistic numbers and executive leaders that not only know soccer as a sport but as a business
3372088 atlanta soccer fans can now watch the worlds greatest athletes play in this months olympic games and know that those same premier players will soon put their talent on display in our city as part of wps
3372089 as a league we want owners who have solid operational business experience a deep rooted passion for soccer and a commitment to the community as well as extensive local connections fitz meets and exceeds these requirements and we look forward to the prospect of adding him as our business partner
3372090 the problem with brett favre right now is that his ego is way too big i know its difficult to pass up 12 million but he does not have the arm he used to he does not have the stamina age eventually catches up with all the great ones the same thing happened to dan marino at the end of his career he thought he could go out and win 16 games with his arm so jimmy johnson finally told his offensive coordinator to let him throw it against jacksonville that year throw it 60 times throw the hell out of the ball they wound up getting blown out marino didnt have the same magic in his arm and went in to talk to johnson after the game he was mad that he did not put him in a good position to succeed at some point you have to trust your coach
3372091 what made john elway unique is that he bought into the plan he understood late in his career that he was not going to have the same magic in all 16 games and in those five or six games that he did not have it he was willing to let terrell davis run for 200 yards and elway pass for 100 the broncos won two super bowls because elway was able to put his ego aside for the best of the team do you think favre is going to do that he went out and criticized his general manager for the moves he made when they were all the right moves after og marco rivera left he went to the cowboys for big money and what did he do he got hurt and no one wanted to sign him he had to retire
3372092 just when you think the redskins front office is starting to figure it out and building through the draft they give up the house for jason taylor a guy that will be lucky to play a few more seasons they could have drafted phillip merling in the second round there were plenty of options in the draft with upside they could have had a young talent who could play another 10 years in the league
3372093 whats interesting when you look at the browns roster is that gm phil savage was hired because of his ability to draft that was ravens gm ozzie newsome s blueprint and drafting was regarded as savages expertise when you look at the browns roster though its a team that was built through free agency jaguars vp of player personnel james shack harris followed ozzies blueprint in jacksonville the jaguars have been heavily built through the draft
3372094 no team has added more veteran free agents than the saints they needed to make some changes in the college department
3372095 what i would like to know about mike shanahan is how much say he has had in bringing in defensive players he has a long history of re coordinating his defensive coordinators and its possible his coordinators wanted the players and that is why they are gone the question is whose philosophy were they following and who was allocating the money to those players was mike responsible or was it ted recently fired gm ted sundquist it makes sense why he was fired if it were ted i know mike brought two trophies and helped bring a new stadium to the owner but since he has been there he has misspent more money than any other team and most of it has come on the defensive side
3372096 i dont see broncos wr brandon marshall making the contribution they are expecting from him he keeps getting in trouble and cant stay healthy
3372097 denver has lost a lot of good coaches in recent years gary kubiak was very good texans ol coach alex gibbs moved on from the offensive line he made it go dolphins wr coach karl dorrell was a really good receivers coach before he went to ucla former te coach tim brewster went to minnesota that takes its toll as much as losing good players
3372098 the chiefs do not have a quarterback thats their problem they didnt draft one in part because there really was not one there to draft and in part because i dont think it was in their plans to draft one early brodie croyle is going to struggle to stay healthy he does not have a 16 game arm the running game better be healthy as long as he is in the lineup
3372099 i was very skeptical about how browns nt shaun rogers would do but he has looked dominant inside
3372100 former chargers and bills gm john butler never won a super bowl but he consistently built teams that contended and was as good as there was drafting talent look at his drafts they were far better than former packers exec ron wolf s yet he does not get nearly the credit as far as drafting goes hes a first ballot gm in my book
3372101 chiefs mlb napoleon harris is awful he has no thump to him at all he is the last one moving he has no instincts he always runs to a block and gives himself up all his movement is lateral never downhill he shows no second effort he looks like tarzan and plays like jane he belongs on the third team he is stealing a paycheck
3372102 now that de luis castillo is locked up the chargers will have some decisions to make they have olt marcus mcneill philip rivers antonio cromartie and shawn merriman all coming up at the same time cromartie has three years left on his deal so there does not have to be as much urgency but the longer they wait the more they are going to have to pay theres not a better corner in the league

3372113 if you lose weight after diagnosis you can achieve some long term benefits in terms of blood pressure and glycemic control that extend even beyond the point at which you regain weight
3372114 we havent had results like this before this is telling us that with a significant mean weight loss of 10 7 kilograms 23 5 pounds in 18 months theres an improvement despite weight regain after 36 months
3372115 its entirely possible that one of the explanations here is that if we looked at 15 years we wouldnt find that benefit continuing
3372116 losing weight is a good idea even if you regain it

3372230 this population wants to take care of themselves and wants to do something about their health they are just looking for some information and tools on how to do it
3372231 its a partial answer but this is a way of helping particularly in settings where prevalence is so high
3372232 should not be seen as a specialist condition anymore this is a condition that needs to be managed in primary care as well as in specialist centers when required
3372233 they get holistic care at the local clinic level with people they know and were comfortable with

3372256 lg electronics is establishing itself as the innovation leader in consumer electronics combining the best of broadband and blu ray connectivity
3372257 lg electronics was the first of our technology partners to publicly embrace our strategy for getting the internet to the tv and is the first to introduce a blu ray player that will instantly stream movies and tv episodes from netflix to the tv
3372258 weve been open 35 years weve never ever ever seen anything like this on this road in broad daylight
3372259 there are certain factors both domestic and external which may add to the slowdown of growth rate but we still think that the growth rate could be 7 5 to 8 per cent
3372260 if there is moderation in the price i am quite sure that monetary policy stance would change
3372261 this is a transition period as china and other emerging countries move towards becoming developed nations and their underlying demand will persist at least in the next 15 to 20 years to keep upward pressure on energy costs
3372262 its unlikely that oil prices will fall back to double digits demand in these countries has not fallen to levels a year ago and as long as they grow there will be fresh demand for resources each year and that accumulative demand will keep supply tight
3372263 it looks unclear if the dollar will keep rising above 110 yen if the dollar reverses its course and falls oil will resume its climb and get back on a rising trend again
3372264 i think 200 is a possibility players see tight supply both in light of current and future fundamentals which will draw money from speculative funds
3372265 its a message from the market that developed countries are not doing enough to tackle the issue of global warming or invest in innovations to save energy and boost efficiency in the use of energy and resources
3372266 since swift action is not taken to change the industrial structure of developed countries that had been supported by cheaply available resources the latest price drop is likely to be a temporary adjustment
3372267 if you looked at barack obamas record public statements and campaign platform as of any time before june 3 2008 the last day of the democratic primaries you could detect a trend on issue after issue after issue there was a conservative position a moderate position a liberal position and then there was an obama position once he won the democratic nomination though obama started moving so quickly to re brand himself as a centrist that youd be forgiven getting whiplash watching him move his own supporters have ranged from bewildered to in denial to enraged to laying out lists of things he must not concede meanwhile in some cases the mccain camp is simply refusing to accept that obama has abandoned his former position preferring to run against the less ambiguous left winger
3372268 basically mccain over the years has presented himself to the public not as an ideas guy but as a moderate pragmatist one who goes here and there sometimes without a ton of predictability or philosophical consistency
3372269 at the end of the day john mccain can get away with this approach on domestic policy issues because nobody doubts that the test of mccains leadership in foreign affairs or in times of crisis is his very lengthy record in those areas regardless of the more mundane business of domestic government unlike obama mccain has earned that credibility because unlike obama mccain has more to back up his words than the words themselves
3372270 ceragon develops transmission equipment for both wireline and wireless networks but the companys real growth has been coming from its wireless business its products allow carriers to quickly accommodate their growth expand their networks and do it more cost effectively
3372271 ceragon is introducing a number of higher margin products that will be rolled out throughout this year and into next it is also cutting expenses so i would now expect to see margin improvements
3372272 as the economy improves and as demand grows internationally i expect that we will see shares do very well sales are picking up in emerging markets such as india and china
3372273 in the second quarter ceragon reported sales in asia pacific grew 92 much higher than expected this offset declining sales in the us down 34 year over year thanks to our economic slowdown
3372274 management expects this kind of growth to continue for the next two years or so thanks to its efforts to expand its networks and build additional capacity
3372275 because of the strong demand in asia pacific management has raised its guidance for the third quarter and expects a growth rate exceeding 35 for the year the company believes that things will improve further in the us next year as carriers migrate to ip networks
3372276 the shares trade at about nine times 2009 expected earnings per share i think however that given the expected improving market for crnts products and improvements in sales and earnings per share growth the shares should trade at 15 times 2009 earnings
3372277 that would give a target price of 10 50 per share plus 2 per share in cash or 12 50 over the next 12 months
3372278 at the pleasure of the president of the united states of america
3372279 i could never vote for him unless he selected that guy to be vp
3372280 i have a lot of family and friends and if he chambliss doesnt back away from this none of them are going to vote for him
3372281 house republicans are doing something inspiring and you the gang of 10 are sabotaging mccains candidacy republicans are tired of your compromising if we wanted the democrat plan then we would vote for him obama
3372282 while i respect our senators desire to find the legislation that reaches consensus with senate democrats the american people are more interested in lower gas prices than in senate procedural pleasantries the only thing they care about is a comprehensive all of the above energy plan to lower the cost of fuel for far too long this congress has accepted compromise energy legislation and look what it has got us 4 gasoline
3372283 the final results from the second of the companys two phase 2 trials were published in the online issue of cancer which is a prestigious peer reviewed scientific journal that is published by the american cancer society
3372284 for those not familiar with the background the patients in this trial who received a dose that is comparable to the dose being used in the ongoing and extensive phase 3 program for gvax for prostate cancer experienced an overall median survival of 35 0 months
3372285 this is nearly identical to the overall median survival achieved in the first phase 2 prostate cancer trial 34 9 months in the patients who received the dose comparable to that being used in phase 3
3372286 just as important if not more so is the fact that the results from both phase 2 trials dwarf the published data on taxotere plus prednisone in the hormone refractory prostate cancer hrpc treatment setting
3372287 to be perfectly clear these phase 2 results on gvax are going to mean very little if neither of the ongoing phase 3 trials is successful our point all along however has been that the company has done an excellent job of taking the correct steps to position gvax as best as possible for success
3372288 using overall survival as the primary endpoint in both phase 3 trials and using a dose similar to that used in prior phase 2 testing which proved successful are two of the things that cege has done exactly right
3372289 patient enrollment in vital 2 the second of the two phase 3 trials is still expected to wrap up in the first half of next year and the triggering of the final analysis of vital 1 the first of the two phase 3 trials is still anticipated to take place in the second half of 2009 cege is a buy under 4

3372302 we continue to see unprecedented growth in u s gas production that will eventually overwhelm the u s gas markets
3372303 even if that number were to increase 100 fold in the next ten years to 11 000 000 or roughly 5 percent of the entire vehicle market a formidable goal the impact on natural gas supplies and the natural gas delivery infrastructure would be small equating about 4 percent of total u s natural gas consumption

3372311 although this is very good news for end users across the globe lets not forget about farmers in the midwest who are still recovering from the worst flooding in 15 years despite the devastation they endured they rose to the task of generating a reliable supply of grains
3372312 the middleclass population is growing rapidly in many developing countries like india for example and as a result more meat milk and eggs are being consumed because people are able to afford these products for the first time in a long time therefore the livestock and poultry sectors are growing and are demanding more feed grains the council will work around the clock to make u s feed grains the first choice of our trading partners
3372313 we have a safe and reliable supply of u s feed grains produced by americas farmers and we will take that message overseas

3372333 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3372334 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3372335 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3372336 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3372337 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3372338 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency

3372341 we have no moral high ground growing up i was taught to look at the united states not from the inside out but from the outside in the signs you see are very disheartening it is probably the worst time ever for us internationally when you go to europe for the most part they just hate us not individually but they think we are just like these big bullies and quite honestly we have acted like that

3372351 otherwise his statement is just deceptive hypocritical and highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress the bottom line is a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic led congress
3372352 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling
3372353 its one of the limitations on his powers he cannot establish the agenda and the agenda is set by the majority party which brings it all right back to the speaker

3372377 non violent drug offenses are being over prosecuted and corporate crime is being under prosecuted
3372378 the justice department must begin to reverse course crank up the crackdown on corporate crime and end the cruel and inhumane war on non violent drug possession
3372379 the criminal justice system is broken so badly that one hardly knows where to begin describing the breakdown
3372380 lets start with the war on drugs since commentators across the political spectrum recognize its lunacy we pour almost endless resources roughly 50 billion every year into catching trying and incarcerating people who primarily harm themselves this insane war on drugs damages communities and drains crucial resources from the police courts and prisons these resources could be better used to combat serious street and corporate crime that directly violates the publics liberty health safety trust and financial well being as with alcoholics and nicotine addicts the approach to drug addicts should be rehabilitation not incarceration
3372381 the current drug policy has consumed tens of billions of dollars and wrecked countless lives
3372382 the costs of this policy include the increasing breakdown of families and neighborhoods endangerment of children widespread violation of civil liberties escalating rates of incarceration political corruption and the imposition of united states policy abroad in practice the drug war disproportionately targets people of color and people who are poverty stricken coercive measures have not reduced drug use but they have clogged our criminal justice system with non violent offenders it is time to explore alternative approaches and to end this costly war
3372383 probably would not have gone on to have the career you have had
3372384 it is urgent that the u s reverse the incarceration binge the u s department of justice estimates that if incarceration rates remain unchanged an estimated one of every 20 americans and greater than one in four african americans can be expected to serve time in prison during their lifetime
3372385 it is time to make the failed war on drugs a central issue in the american political dialogue for too long we have let this injustice continue to grow unhindered taking action on clemency at the federal level will set an example for the states and begin the process of reversing this failed policy
3372386 the current cruel unjust policy perpetuated and enforced by the bush administration prevents americans who suffer from debilitating illnesses from experiencing the relief of medicinal cannabis
3372387 while substantial scientific and anecdotal evidence exists to validate marijuanas usefulness in treating disease a deluge of rhetoric from washington claims that marijuana has no medicinal value

3372418 it is merely a rumor started by someone who obviously is miserable in their own skin that they would even have the notion to attack a child
3372419 rest assured reginae is tucked away in her bed at this very moment trying to get past the hurt this ugliness has caused her and our family
3372420 ive been doing an album with lil wayne its called t wayne the project its basically just going to be an array of things just a visual love the two artists youve seen collaborate with everyone except each other when you see us together its crazy right now we already have what weve done were gonna keep going till they tell us to stop we might even put out a mixtape weve got so many songs that we just might do a t wayne mixtape too
3372421 basically i got a lot of stuff on my album thats not that simple its just basically a way to calm things down
3372422 getting the kids ready to go back to school and motivating them to get their minds together
3372423 they listen to his music so by him speaking out to the children that helps out hes standing behind where he went wrong at and hes spending time with them showing them right and wrong
3372424 i cant stress enough the value of education and importance of an education
3372425 i recognize that i have put myself in a position i have to go and pay my debt to society rather than dreading that im looking forward to putting this all behind me

3372436 allison has a special gift of looking at questions from new perspectives and recognizing relationships that others have either overlooked or missed all together
3372437 this ability has enabled her to make a couple of key breakthroughs as a graduate student that have stumped other scientists for decades
3372438 one symptom of an infected tomato or potato plant with this bacterium is yellowing of the foliage
3372439 the saliva of the tomato psyllid has been known to cause yellowing of tomato and potato leaves the cause of this symptom has been a mystery for over a century
3372440 what we know is that the bacterium is vectored by the tomato potato psyllid into their tomato and potato host plants subsequently causing yellowing and death to the plant
3372441 this knowledge may help growers come up with alternative strategies for controlling this pest were now working in the lab to confirm whether candidatus liberibacter psyllaurous is the psyllid yellows causing bacterium
3372442 chinese farmers call the young infected yellowing shoots of citrus yellow dragons because of the symptoms this disease causes in the plant
3372443 liberibacter psyllaurous could be a good model system to come up with methods for combating citrus greening disease

3372466 this now paves the way for the transfer of credits from the clean development mechanism into the eu registry system linking up with the uns carbon credit registry will further strengthen europes leading role in the global carbon market
3372467 this increased cost estimate is reasonable given inflation and the expected increase in the amount of spent nuclear fuel from existing reactors with license renewals
3372468 these soaring costs are yet another reminder why the so called
3372469 we need real solutions to our climate and energy problems that are fast and affordable and nuclear is neither
3372470 to spend nearly 100bn on a hole in the ground guaranteed to massively leak deadly radioactivity into the drinking water supply over time would perhaps represent the biggest boondoggle yet of the atomic age
3372471 sixty six years after enrico fermi first split the atom we still dont have a solution for the first cupful of high level radioactive waste generated
3372472 the department of energy finally has admitted what many observers already knew the proposed yucca mountain nuclear waste dump would be the most expensive public works project in recorded history
3372473 its cost is rising far higher than inflation giving rise to the likelihood that the cost will increase far more before the facility could ever be completed
3372474 but even at nearly 100bn the doe cannot assure that the dump wont leak nor that it would even meet basic regulatory requirements

3372485 tsmc is committed to offering high quality silicon proven standard cell libraries to enable customers to design at 40nm technologies
3372486 by adopting eldo as our characterization spice engine we are confident that we can deliver to this commitment
3372487 tsmc is the technology leader in advanced process technology so clearly eldos role as tsmcs simulator for 40nm standard cell characterization is an important one

3372490 most of us are pseudo scholars and i want to consider our characteristics with sympathy and respect for we are a very large and quite a powerful class eminent in church and state we control the eudcation of the empire we lend to the press such distinction as it consents to receive and we are a welcome asset at dinner parties pseudo scholarship is on its good side the homage paid by ignorance to learning it also has an economic side on which we need not be hard most of us must get a job before thirty or sponge on our relatives and many jobs can be got only by passing an exam the pseudo scholar often does well in examinations real scholars are not much good and even when he fails he appreciates their innate majesty they are gateways to employment they have power to ban and bless a paper on king lear may lead somewhere unlike the rather far fetched play of the same name it may be a stepping stone to the local government board
3372491 it gives me a lot of confidence but at the same time weve still got three more preseason games im not thinking about making the team just thinking about getting my job down
3372492 any time you miss two weeks of camp thats development and timing and right now mine is a little off but you know were practicing so all i can do is get better
3372493 these results mark a cornerstone in the development of euv lithography they represent the first real 22 nm resist data building confidence for euv as a viable technology for 22 nm half pitch lithography
3372494 partnering with resist suppliers to accelerate resist cycles of learning has been critical to bringing euv resist readiness to this point where euv resists can now support 22 nm half pitch imaging the combination of sematech and resist supplier expertise has been an indispensable asset in conducting this important advanced research
3372495 this achievement was deemed to be impossible by leading resist experts only a few years ago resist suppliers have made excellent progress in improving euv resist resolution thanks to access to the mets which provide the highest resolution available worldwide among euv optical imaging systems
3372496 the focus of sematechs euv resist development program is to engineer current car platforms to realize 22 nm high pitch introduction and provide a fundamental understanding of euv resist exposure mechanisms to develop new platforms
3372497 we believe this two pronged approach will drive resist development to the highest level and support euvl introduction
3372498 1 the united states has more musicians in its military bands than it has diplomats 2 this year alone the united states army will add about 7 000 soldiers to its total thats more people than in the entire american foreign service 3 more than 1 000 american diplomatic positions are vacant because the foreign service is so short staffed but a myopic congress is refusing to finance even modest new hiring some 1 100 could be hired for the cost of a single c 17 military cargo plane in short the united states is hugely overinvesting in military tools and underinvesting in diplomatic tools the result is a lopsided foreign policy that antagonizes the rest of the world and is ineffective in tackling many modern problems
3372499 our intuitive approach to fighting terrorists and insurgents is to blow things up but one of the most cost effective counterterrorism methods in countries like pakistan and afghanistan may be to build things up like schooling and microfinance girls education sometimes gets more bang for the buck than a missile
3372500 he clearly leans toward the diplomacy side in world affairs foreign aid agriculture aid using federal tax dollars to buy a countrys affections is one element of diplomacy but i hope he realizes that having a strong military is another form of diplomacy
3372501 be there or else well kick your butt to smithereens
3372502 lets agree that diplomats should be every bit as much of an american priority as musicians in military bands
3372503 the governor thinks this is an inappropriate practice that e zpass should be used for business purposes this is something that should be corrected
3372504 use of a companys products for its employees is very standard and the trips represent only a fraction of a percent of toll revenues
3372505 im always interested in new delivery systems for stories and always curious about how those systems work with the old story telling verities this one it seems to me works extraordinarily well
3372506 the synergy between marvel scribner and cbs in bringing this venture in entertainment to fruition has been phenomenal so its only fitting that such collaboration could occur only under the auspices and creative inspiration of stephen king and his infectious storytelling

3372508 somalia faces many climate related problems such as floods and droughts which in addition to the lack of peace and security in a large part of the country have left a significant portion of the population dependant on food aid
3372509 with a large proportion of this population being youth it is vital that their energies be tapped to ensure the country a better future
3372510 it is important to actively engage somali youth like their counterparts elsewhere in the world in areas of preparedness and action to deal with effects of climate change
3372511 the american people rose up and said look in the united states its time for the immigrants to adapt to our ways not the other way around
3372512 e specially given that an immigrant to an islamic country had darn well better adopt islam and try to build a church in saudi arabia and see how far you get
3372513 but the islamicists come to this country and they use and abuse our legal system in order to impose their religion on the rest of us well for once the people have risen up and said not here not today its a big victory
3372514 extremely crucial since this holiday is as important to muslims as christmas is to christians
3372515 i am sad to be leaving because ive had a wonderful time here in wolfsburg
3372516 bit im looking forward to my new task it is a huge challenge to win titles with flamengo
3372517 marcelinhos departure is a big loss for us and the bundesliga as a whole
3372518 i had the impression that he wanted to move and i didnt want to stand in his way
3372519 finally after all this time i am here now i want to help the team and start this new adventure
3372520 peruzzi was a great goalkeeper and i want to do well just as he did
3372521 weve brought six in so the squad is more competitive i believe its a lot stronger than last season
3372522 with hunger on the rise we are doing our best to stream incoming contributions to the people most in need in africa asia and the caribbean
3372523 it is essential to launch a bold new set of responses to stem a full blown hunger and nutritional crisis
3372524 im delighted but i will not get too euphoric ive been selected a few times now but ive been cursed with injury each time
3372525 we are looking at more cost effective ways to manage and develop the oyster card system that we expect will save millions over the next few years the savings will be reinvested to deliver further improvements in londons transport system
3372526 manchester united have made an offer for david silva but valencia have turned it down and that is because of the players wishes
3372527 he wants to stay in spain we can confirm he will be starting the season in valencia and if does ever make a move it wont be to the premier league
3372528 after a few more games i am sure freddy and clinton will get goals
3372529 we have to remember they have not played together properly before
3372530 its been a long time coming ive been through a lot the 100th goal was for my family my wife and kids
3372531 we were playing long ball we looked nervous and our defending was schoolboy stuff but to get the three points is a good sign
3372532 all you really have to do is dance to save the world
3372533 i think paris are going to have to look for another solution because it is very tricky to find an agreement with fenerbahce i am very disappointed by this situation
3372534 i would love to play for paris but i still have two years left on my contract with fenerbahce the clubs cant come to an agreement and the president is playing a very hard game with me
3372535 they are not ready for this game but hopefully both will be available for the weekend

3372555 i have been fiddling the books for years and i cant live with it any more i want to confess
3372556 one can well understand the reaction in a small community to what he has done he has gone from being a popular and quite well known figure to where he is ostracised by many people
3372557 during the medieval warm period from about ad 900 to 1250 the hydrographic and environmental conditions were similar to those of the present time
3372558 can be used to characterize terrigenous organic matter from plants
3372559 is also still as great as ever with a factor of 2 at both high and low latitudes
3372560 because we have not had recent climate changes of the magnitude forecast for the rest of this century
3372561 we can have greater confidence in the multi model mean changes than in that of any individual model for climate change assessments
3372562 it is doubtful that averaging different formulations together will end up giving the right result
3372563 model responses e g tropical land precipitation can often be of different signs and there can be little confidence that averaging them together will produce a better result
3372564 at this point we cannot determine the low and high latitude sensitivities and we have no real way of obtaining them our italics
3372565 affect the confidence we can have in many of our projections of atmospheric dynamic and hydrologic responses to global warming
3372566 forecasting even the large scale response to climate change is not easy given the current uncertainties
3372567 regional responses may be the end result of varying influences in part due to warming in different tropical and high latitude regions
3372568 real progress will be the result of continued and newer observations along with modeling improvements based on these observations
3372569 there is no guarantee that these issues will be resolved before a substantial global warming impact is upon us
3372570 the 19 year old had initially fallen four hundredths of a second short of the criteria time in the 200 meter freestyle and it seemed he would have to wait four years to make his olympic debut in london the high court of the olympic committee of israel decided however that national record of 1 48 76 minutes which he set in croatia two weeks ago is good enough as he never had the chance to request to be selected as one of the three youngsters in the delegation because the now suspended max jaben had initially been israels representative to the games in the 200m free

3372578 they came in and worked so hard this summer what im most proud of is how they came in and competed they didnt want to sit back and say hey im going to take a year and redshirt
3372579 even if that happens theres nothing against a redshirt you want to come and compete and win a job if you dont win at least it makes the guy in front of you better
3372580 julio and b j come out and work hard every day its hard to find true freshman who come out and work like that every day you have to respect that
3372581 julio hes going to make some big plays this year hes can go up and get it he can run by guys
3372582 its coming together the receiving group is starting to form
3372583 you play fast and you play hard and things are going to happen
3372584 obviously how they play is affected by a their instincts b theyre ability to learn and execute their job and still play fast and use those instincts to be good tacklers and be able to play their responsibility on the defense
3372585 were pleased with all three young linebacker that we have all three guys are learning and i think grinding a little bit upstairs with calls right now they all make plays and they all make flashes of ability
3372586 hes going to help us a lot at star and safety
3372587 theyre really bringing something to the table one thing im impressed with is how they bring their toughness and determination to practice a lot of times you kind of have to earn it
3372588 they told me that they gave it to the chairman of compensation committee but there has been no answer until now
3372589 they were yelling and screaming and whacking me in the head

3372593 well as far as these dogs we obviously have to complete our investigation which is still ongoing our officers did go out to the scene today to collect more information and more statements from witnesses and so at this point we are going to try to complete the investigation and possibly classifying this dog as dangerous
3372594 este proceso de cambio tiene que continuar las prefecturas no han invertido el dinero que nos pertenece esos dineros deben ser destinados a los pueblos donde est n los campesinos que no cuentan con servicios b sicos por ejemplo y no se lo roben los prefectos
3372595 queremos que esos dineros se destinen a la construcci n de caminos colegios hospitales queremos que se apoye este proceso de cambio es lo nico que queremos los campesinos de bolivia
3372596 it can generate up to 60 percent of the electrical energy usage of the house and i guess the better question isnt why do we offer it as much as why dont other people offer it
3372597 desde lo m s profundo de nuestro coraz n y en nombre del pueblo maya y campesino organizado en la coordinadora nacional ind gena y campesina conic reciba nuestras felicitaciones por el triunfo obtenido en el referendo revocatorio del 10 de agosto
3372598 compa ero evo aprovechamos para saludar su convicci n y seguridad en su pueblo porque llamar a un referendo en un momento dif cil como se vive en bolivia hay que tener una confianza total en el pueblo su decisi n ha sido ejemplar que consolida su gobierno y el proceso revolucionario en construcci n
3372599 este ejercicio democr tico debe servir de ejemplo a tantos gobiernos de nuestra am rica que terminan repudiados por sus pueblos porque imponen su voluntad y no escuchan a los despose dos muchos menos a los pueblos ind genas
3372600 a los enemigos de la humanidad no les va gustar este proyecto porque est n acostumbrados de lucrarse con los bienes y pobreza de los pueblos gracias por levantar la bandera y dignidad de los pueblos ind genas de bolivia y del mundo
3372601 he said he did it because he wanted to buy some stuff
3372602 i would do anything give up my home die just to make him not do something like that
3372603 put a lot of people in jeopardy there he put himself in extreme jeopardy you could have had a 12 year old shot by a cop
3372604 if you only have so much money you have to spend it on what you consider is more important
3372605 none of these government agencies will do a thing for me
3372606 its very physical its just the whole ordeal of it
3372607 my major issue is just to get through and offer this service to people
3372608 i want to be able to do it safely not only for my business but also for the public
3372609 ive always been a fighter ive always fought for my life
3372610 when he pulled out the gun i thought of my mother shes the emotional type and she started screaming i was afraid that he would turn his attention toward her and shoot her
3372611 i just wanted to scare him so he wouldnt shoot my mother
3372612 this is not to say that obesity is not a problem
3372613 but there may be certain individuals for whom obesity is not as big a problem as we thought
3372614 im sure there are things people can do to help bring down their risk factors even if they cant get the weight off
3372615 we have to realize that staying at a healthy weight is very hard
3372616 its more important to feel good about yourself to come in and exercise regularly for good health
3372617 as you get to your middle ages you have to decide if youre going to be one of those guys who sits back and watches two hours of tv a night or if youre going to the gym
3372618 i want to go to the gym i want to feel alive and feel good
3372619 we dont know if obese people with no risk factors are protected for their whole lives or just for some period of time
3372620 as we get further into the obesity epidemic there are going to be more and more people who have been obese their whole lives and this could be a very different picture it may be that your body just cant stay heart healthy that long
3372621 you cant just look at your bmi and say i must be healthy or i must be unhealthy
3372622 the couch potatoes who are real thin can be at higher risk than an obese nfl lineman
3372623 gas the distance the economy none of that stops us
3372624 what youre seeing is a reflection of absolute discontent with the republican administration
3372625 the democrats are focusing on registering anybody who has a heartbeat regardless of whether the registered person has any intent to vote
3372626 the state and the country are pretty evenly divided right now that means all groups whether young people or african american or latino can make a difference in a close election
3372627 he makes it real he helps them understand how they can get involved he is giving everybody the opportunity to be engaged in this political process
3372628 it can motivate african american and young voters but it can also motivate those democrats who cant bring themselves to vote for obama
3372629 cari amici grazie per tutto questi giorni finiscono ma porto con me un tesoro di ricordi
3372630 solo adesso vedo quale esercito di angeli custodi mi ha circondato
3372631 saluto tutti i cittadini di bressanone anche io adesso sono un cittadino di bressanone
3372632 come tutte le cose belle questi giorni sono terminati porto con me un tesoro di ricordi
3372633 nei momenti difficili dio ci porge la mano e chiede a noi di porgerla al prossimo nel bisogno
3372634 bressanone per me un luogo di incontri incontro delle culture incontro anche tra una sana laicit ed una gioiosa fede cattolica incontro tra una grande storia e il presente e il futuro
3372635 c un punto nel vangelo di marco dove egli racconta che dopo giorni di stress il signore ha detto ai discepoli
3372636 paolo vi fra lostracismo del clero e quello dei mass media
3372637 una gmg grande i giorni di sydney hanno lasciato un forte segno scialbi i resoconti dei quotidiani italiani
3372638 abbiamo ricevuto unenorme risonanza sui mass media e su internet con riflessi notevoli sul turismo a livello personale ci sono stati momenti che non dimenticher mai
3372639 sono state due settimane molto intense di festa per la nostra citt che lasceranno una traccia profonda in me e nella popolazione il pontefice ha riconosciuto in diversi incontri e occasioni che siamo stati capaci di offrirgli quella serenit e quel momento di pace e di riflessione che ricercava
3372640 in tutti gli appuntamenti del pontefice e in particolare negli angelus abbiamo riscontrato una grande simpatia un notevole calore da parte delle migliaia di persone e di pellegrini che erano presenti
3372641 un affetto continua il sindaco della citt altoatesina pienamente ricambiato dal pontefice
3372642 benedetto xvi prosegue purgstaller ha parlato di bressanone come di una citt europea modello un luogo che da tempo esempio ed espressione di apertura di dialogo culturale e religioso di felice incontro fra radici cristiane e modernit
3372643 la visita del pontefice conclude il primo cittadino di bressanone ha anche alimentato un ulteriore interesse nei confronti della nostra citta grazie allafflusso di informazione su questo evento abbiamo ricevuto unenorme risonanza sui mass media e su internet con riflessi notevoli sul turismo

3372645 massive frog die offs had for years been linked to environmental conditions
3372646 new data from australia suggest that the real killer may be a deadly fungus
3372647 in some of the very die offs that first raised the amphibian alarm in the united states
3372648 a convincing case blaming global climate change for these ecological events
3372649 an alternative mechanism upwind deforestation of lowlands that may increase convective and orographic cloud bases even more than changes in sea surface temperature do
3372650 deforested areas of costa ricas caribbean lowlands remain relatively cloud free when forested regions have well developed dry season cumulus cloud fields
3372651 lies directly upwind of the monteverde tropical montane cloud forest
3372652 constrained by a variety of ground based and remotely sensed observations
3372653 examine the sensitivity of orographic cloud formation in the monteverde region to three different land use scenarios in the adjacent lowland and premontane regions
3372654 deforestation has decreased the cloud forest area covered with fog in the montane regions by around 5 13 and raised the orographic cloud bases by about 25 75 meters in the afternoon
3372655 further deforestation in the lowland and premontane regions would lead to around a 15 decrease in the cloud forest area covered with fog and also raise the orographic cloud base heights by up to 125 meters in the afternoon
3372656 many cloud forest dependent amphibians have declined or gone extinct on a mountain in costa rica pounds et al 1999 2005
3372657 among harlequin frogs in central and south american tropics an astounding 67 have disappeared over the past 20 30 years
3372658 is largest at middle our italics elevations even though higher elevation species generally have smaller ranges
3372659 to stimulate thought and generate ideas concerning the altitudinal patterns of thermal environments the recent temperature shifts and the interactions between batrachochytrium and its amphibian hosts
3372660 future experimental studies should examine these ideas while also considering the influence of other climatic changes such as shifts in precipitation and humidity
3372661 pounds et al 2006 did not focus on showing whether the pathogen was present or causing disease in the species studied raising questions as to whether infection by b dendrobatidis was actually involved in the observed species declines
3372662 with climate change promoting infectious disease and eroding biodiversity the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas concentrations is now undeniable our italics
3372663 amphibian populations are declining across the globe at an alarming rate with over 43 of species in a state of decline
3372664 both field studies on amphibians briggs et al 2005 lips et al 2006 and on fungal population genetics morehouse et al 2003 morgan et al 2007 strongly suggest that bd is a newly introduced invasive pathogen
3372665 need to understand as quickly as possible the global patterns and causes of amphibian declines to prevent further losses of biodiversity
3372666 a classical pattern of disease spread across native populations at odds with the cleh proposed by pounds et al 2006
3372667 analyses and re analyses of data related to the cleh all fail to support that hypothesis
3372668 support a hypothesis that bd is an introduced pathogen that spreads from its point of origin in a pattern typical of many emerging infectious diseases
3372669 the available data simply do not support the hypothesis that climate change has driven the spread of bd in our study area
3372670 outbreaks of chytridiomycosis are triggered by a shrinking thermal envelope
3372671 implicitly assumes that species cannot evolve in response to changing climate
3372672 many examples of contemporary evolution in response to climate change exist
3372673 in less than 40 years populations of the frog rana sylvatica have undergone localized evolution in thermal tolerance skelly and freidenburg 2000 temperature specific development rate skelly 2004 and thermal preference freidenburg and skelly 2004
3372674 laboratory studies of insects show that thermal tolerance can change markedly after as few as 10 generations good 1993
3372675 studies of microevolution in plants show substantial trait evolution in response to climate manipulations bone and farres 2001
3372676 collectively these findings show that genetic variation for traits related to thermal performance is common and evolutionary response to changing climate has been the typical finding in experimental and observational studies hendry and kinnison 1999 kinnison and hendry 2001
3372677 has grown much stronger e g stockwell et al 2003 berteaux et al 2004 hariston et al 2005 bradshaw and holzapfel 2006 schwartz et al 2006 urban et al 2007
3372678 on the basis of the present knowledge of genetic variation in performance traits and species capacity for evolutionary response it can be concluded that evolutionary change will often occur concomitantly with changes in climate our italics and bold as well as with other environmental changes e g grant and grant 2002 stockwell et al 2003 balanya et al 2006 jump et al 2006 pelletier et al 2007
3372679 its very exciting knowing that i could be the first true freshman quarterback to play at lsu in a long time
3372680 just being a part of that situation is really important in my life so whenever that opportunity comes im going to work hard and do what i need to do
3372681 its a little different now than it was during recruiting because i wasnt in the top three
3372682 to be honest when i signed i really didnt think id have a chance to play this year
3372683 theyve been telling me to work as if i want to be the starter so ive been doing that
3372684 now if i come here and do my thing ill play early if i dont ill be on the side
3372685 this is me this is who i am and you must accept it
3372686 this is not a fashion you can put on and take off like this years dress
3372687 i couldnt live with myself if i got you a job with these people
3372688 and you dont need to worry about your accent any more
3372689 we are looking at a cold cold winter in upstate new york
3372690 george bush and big oil special interests killed this responsible drilling bill because they werent satisfied with their record profits
3372691 if mr massa is serious about disagreeing with speaker pelosi maybe he should put his money where his mouth is and return the 14 000 in campaign contributions hes received from pelosi
3372692 otherwise his statement is just deceptive hypocritical and highlights everything thats wrong with the democratic majority thats leading congress the bottom line is a vote for eric massa is a vote for speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic led congress
3372693 only speaker nancy pelosi can set the agenda for the u s house of representatives and speaker pelosi has made it clear she wont allow a vote on a comprehensive energy plan that includes drilling
3372694 its one of the limitations on his powers he cannot establish the agenda and the agenda is set by the majority party which brings it all right back to the speaker
3372695 gt buffalo bills all pro punter brian moorman 8 also holds for field goals and kicker rian lindell here the pair work out at training camp at st john fisher college
3372696 i feel great and i feel even better about the team
3372697 the optimism the community shows is shared by the team we are excited about what we have put on the field its not like any other year that i have been here
3372698 we work together its like a psychologist we are always trying to improve from each other
3372699 hes really fast and hes got tremendous leg speed like a runner his ability to strike the sweet spot on a ball is better than most other punters
3372700 when i signed with seattle i was just thrilled to be in the league
3372701 i was just thrilled to have a jersey with my name on it i started to improve though and i realized this was not some pipe dream
3372702 nothing is different for kickers and punters the ball is the same the uprights are the same the competition might be different for some of the guys but for kickers it shows people how capable we really are
3372703 you are not going to find a better atmosphere in all of the country
3372704 it is division ii football but it is still good football the fans are amazing and the atmosphere is incredible i would put it up against any other school
3372705 a necessary step in understanding the physical relation between co 2 forcing and climate change
3372706 determined the chronology of high and low latitude climate change at the last glacial termination by radiocarbon dating benthic and planktonic foraminiferal stable isotope and magnesium calcium records
3372707 deep sea temperatures warmed by 2 c between 19 and 17 thousand years before the present leading the rise in atmospheric co 2 and tropical surface ocean warming by 1000 years
3372708 does not lie within the tropics nor can its early onset between 19 and 17 thousand years before the present be attributed to co 2 forcing
3372709 if increased biomass production is to continue nutrient availability in the soil has to match increasing demand for major nutrients
3372710 increased tree growth under elevated co 2 has not resulted in the depletion of phosphorus pools in soils as originally hypothesized but rather in the replenishment and increased storage of p in the rooting zone
3372711 p may not therefore limit tree growth in a high co
3372712 biogenically driven weathering of primary minerals in the rooting zone is sufficient to maintain the replenishment of plant available inorganic p
3372713 since future levels of elevated co 2 may stimulate biomass production in a diverse range of forests norby et al 2005 this increase of p availability is of global consequence
3372714 show that it is possible to identify rhizobial strains to improve plant performance under predicted future co 2 concentrations with no negative effect on nutritive value
3372715 believed to keep sinking all the way down to the bottom cutting deep crevasses and vertical tunnels that scientists call moulins
3372716 when the water reaches the bottom of the ice it lubricates the surface of the bedrock and destabilizes the ice mass
3372717 large pieces of ice to slide quickly into the ocean
3372718 could lead to a far more rapid disintegration of the ice sheets than predicted by any current models
3372719 present ice velocity measurements from the major ablation area along the western margin of the ice sheet
3372720 ice velocity reacts to increased meltwater production and increases by a factor of 4
3372721 over a longer period of 17 years annual ice velocities have decreased slightly
3372722 in earlier work lemke et al 2007 zwally et al 2002 it has been suggested that the interaction between meltwater production and ice velocity provides a positive feedback leading to a more rapid and stronger response of the ice sheet to climate warming than hitherto assumed
3372723 the englacial hydraulic system adjusts constantly to the variable meltwater input which results in a more or less constant ice flux over the years
3372724 may have only a limited effect on the response of the ice sheet to climate warming over the next decades

3372730 it was a lot of fun even though it was very hard because they pressed us a lot you just have to take a lot of good things from this game because they are the best
3372731 what i will remember is the play in the second quarter the usa was on a fastbreak and somebody passed the ball to lebron and he dunked it with his left hand it think it was amazing
3372732 but liberals and democrats also abetted the triumph of the right they mostly stopped arguing over theory democrats and liberals won some policy battles and some elections and they presided over a prosperous moment but they did it by selling themselves as reagan lite by overselling small social advances pilot projects and placebos and by riding the crest of a credit boom that could not be sustained
3372733 however liberal economists today get a painful surprise when they look back and see what the first modern liberal franklin roosevelt attempted for while new dealers of the 1930s and mainstream liberal economists of the 1970s share a common commitment toward income redistribution contemporary liberal economists have far greater respect for the value of competitive market mechanisms in making sure there is something to redistribute

3372740 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3372741 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3372742 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3372743 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3372744 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3372745 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3372746 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit

3372766 ive already said that in accordance with the united nations code we are trying to force georgia which started the aggression to peace we find this tactic very effective and the only possible one i want to remind you that history has seen many examples of pacification by the aggressor in this way western countries did it seventy years ago and you know the tragic consequences of it i mean the lessons of the munich agreement of 1938
3372767 we are in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country we are in the process of the destruction of world order as it was established after the end of the cold war and it is so obvious that the world has to react there is no way georgian people would ever live with occupation and annexation

3372794 building on earlier work by scientists at carnegie mellon university vella developed a mathematical model to determine the maximum weight load that a thin flexible cylinder representing a water striders legs can support on a liquid surface without sinking he found that as the length of the cylinder increases the maximum load at first increases but then reaches a plateau at some critical length
3372795 after that length the cylinder begins to bend and is not able to support more weight comparing the model to measurements on museum specimens vella found that the striders legs are typically slightly shorter than the critical length this suggests that the water striders legs are just the right length long enough to provide maximum weight support but not long enough to bend and hinder the insects movement he says
3372796 the amazing water strider known for its ability to walk on water came within just a hair of sinking into evolutionary oblivion
3372797 it indicates that early eating patterns have effects that persist over time regardless of later changes in diet

3372805 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
3372806 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
3372807 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
3372808 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
3372809 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
3372810 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
3372811 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
3372812 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
3372813 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
3372814 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
3372815 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
3372816 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
3372817 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

3372838 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3372839 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3372840 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3372841 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3372842 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3372843 people were extremely rude they just thought it was a ridiculous request
3372844 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3372845 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3372846 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3372847 sites tapping into consumer concerns about the economy giving them the opportunity to save money dominate the fastest growing list coupons and reward sites classifieds and shopping comparison engines are obvious examples but walkers snack foods is the fastest growing site of all due to their brit trips promotion offering discounts on british holidays and trips around attractions hotels and restaurants

3372888 i am shocked by cicis tragic death she was very popular with the staff and work colleagues
3372889 my sympathies go out to her family and friends everyone has been devastated by the events
3372890 it was a friend a female member of our staff who went to her flat with other friends after she failed to turn up for work
3372891 she was so popular i cant speculate on anything to do with the inquiry but i dont know any reason why anyone would want to do this to her
3372892 as far as i know at this time two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get an education who have both worked hard done extremely well and graduated with good degrees have been killed

3372898 it wasnt what they did but the vibe was very similar mine was a bit less epic it was more about the progression of him and it was more in gotham city he didnt go to tibet and meet cool people but it was very similar in vibe
3372899 in my version there was actually a new villain it wasnt one of the classics which is probably why they didnt use it it was more of a hannibal lector type he was somebody already in arkham asylum that bruce went and sort of studied with it was a whole thing i get very emotional about it i still love the story maybe ill get to do it as a comic one day

3372901 a black tie event disguised in a pair of jeans and nice top
3372902 were not even realizing what an incredible athlete he is
3372903 obviously hes amazing and he breaks all these world records but i think being a part of that we almost take it for granted
3372904 i want to do things that no one else in the sport has ever done
3372905 it will remain to be seen where history ultimately places him but clearly today he is the best swimmer weve seen
3372906 he was very active and never stopped moving and it was kind of hard to harness that at first
3372907 its a little bit counterintuitive because even though he was so rambunctious as a young swimmer when he raced he was very focused
3372908 i always had dreams of being an olympian being a world record holder being a professional athlete being a gold medallist and i had to focus on those goals to achieve them and i knew that
3372909 i think he missed out on a normal progression of things but i wouldnt say hes missed anything
3372910 i would say he would tell you what hes gained has been a lot better than what hes missed
3372911 i would never trade going to the olympic games and standing on top of the medal podium or being able to turn professional or travel all over the world i would never trade any of it in
3372912 there are a lot of things that people havent done and i want to change the sport and be the first person to do new things

3372921 this hit sequel almost didnt come to fruition the reason how about an a list film actor who was also an a list television actor who couldnt keep his libido under control seems as if this a lister took a bet from another a list film actor that a certain wife of yet a third a list film actor was open to his charms well it turns out that he was right the wife of the third a list actor did have a relationship with our first a list actor i guess maybe relationship is the wrong word it was either once or twice depending on which story you believe what is known though is that the wife confessed all to the third a list actor who then decided he couldnt work with a list actor number one anymore he finally gave in to the pressure from the studio but has not said one word to a list actor 1 outside of hello or goodbye since that date as for the bet a list actor 1 offered up his girlfriend for the night a list actor 2 offered up his girlfriend for the night unfortunately no one bothered to check if this was ok with the girlfriend of a list actor 2 she declined although not for being bartered in a bet or possibly destroying a marriage she just didnt find a list actor 1 appealing

3372924 this occurred in the context of continuing credit market turbulence and its impact on the firms operating performance and reputation
3372925 the uncertain near term outlook for global financial markets and potential changes in regulatory capital requirements
3372926 our review has clearly revealed the weaknesses associated with the integrated one firm business model

3372943 after a decade of near stagnation new york citys graduation rate has climbed significantly since 2002
3372944 we clearly need to help larger numbers of students to graduate but the progress weve made so far means that thousands more students are graduating today than would have six years ago
3372945 i think a fifth year if it works is perfectly acceptable
3372946 we dont have a regents action item on that yet
3372947 other than search what has google done right they have 1 001 products in beta but whats been successful
3372948 there has been a sequence of missteps and failures and this is not the end they miscalculated the valuation of aol and this is the first time theyre admitting to it
3372949 for advertisers to prosper they need competitive markets we think google is a fantastic company our sense is that if the transaction with yahoo proceeds theres the potential the development of yahoo ad system panama and other competing systems will atrophy over time

3372951 why have the scorpions not investigated chemical warfare expert wouter basson and the cia who have created this aids the scorpions are working for mi5 and the cia and not for south africa
3372952 integration would streamline and strengthen capacity in the fight against crime
3372953 disbanding it requires a political decision the scorpions chose some prime cases because they were serving the interests of their own political masters
3372954 where they have not succeeded they have been mum to the media
3372955 it suggests to me this is the gang who cant shoot straight my surmise is that they didnt have a pot of money that they could easily fit this into so a little creative bookkeeping was done and you take it out of the promart budget

3372979 we just kind of got out there for about a minute and after that just kind of stuck it
3372980 we were pretty smooth together because you know rogers has been doing this forever
3372981 hes so crafty you cant give him an inch because hell figure out how to win
3372982 i knew he was going to be really strong hes really cagey so he knew when to go and when to hold back so he rode the race really smart
3372983 then andy went thurlow got him at the bottom the corner of the final climb and thats where i went and that was that

3373009 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
3373010 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from

3373026 theres a lot of patients who are using these medications who may not need these or may be able to use a different medication that doesnt have these side effects
3373027 if someone has a hip fracture their chance of dying is 20 per cent in six months
3373028 even those who dont die as a result of it theyre still often left with significant disability and loss of independence
3373029 furthermore use has been increasing in recent years likely because of a number of factors including increasing affordability with the emergence of generic and over the counter formulations

3373043 that the catholic church neglects this issue as with other infirmities even contagious ones the love of christ has led those who care for those affected to even risk their own lives
3373044 the church loves aids patients too and cares for them with love
3373045 the most common position is that of providing for safe sex through the use of condoms the catholic church however proposes other more positive ways and that puts her against the tide in seeking the comprehensive good of persons the condom is a cork its not always effective proposals should lead to educating people in true love
3373046 sexuality is not a toy sexuality is the carnal expression of human love which god has placed in the human heart
3373047 in this field of aids as in all fields that include the proper use of sexuality the church presents the proposal of true love which brings with it a proper education in the virtue of chastity
3373048 make unbridled use of their own sexuality in the name of greater freedom at first this sounds good but going down this path man becomes a slave of his own selfishness and he will never learn to truly love
3373049 curiously the statistics on aids infection fly in the face of these proposals by going down this road we head toward moral ruin
3373050 concrete experiences such as that of uganda where this proposal has been put in practice at catholic hospitals have reduced aids infections from 80 to 10 no other program has achieved such drastic reductions
3373051 through the storm a real story of fame and family in a tabloid world
3373052 beyond the reach of the paparazzi and outside the narrow orbit of the hollywood glitterati to share the inside story of the spears family as only a mother can tell it
3373053 the slowdown in demand related to the general economic downturn and high oil prices is becoming increasingly evident
3373054 consumers clearly are reacting by a change in driving behavior
3373055 it looks too early to cite definitively a sea change in the market
3373056 flagged a vigorous start to what could be an active autumn storm season
3373057 customer traffic picked up over the last week but cautious back to school spending held back the sales pace for the week
3373058 key drivers of revenue such as investment banking and mergers and acquisition have simply not been happening enough to stimulate related business
3373059 goldman has among the highest exposures to equities estimated at 35 during a period of significant equity market declines including areas of expansion such as china
3373060 in the case of the three men you shot them with a sub machinegun as some form of execution because of a prior drug deal where you were dissatisfied none of the three were armed you lured them to the cowells residence to kill those responsible and to compensate yourself by taking a further kilo of cocaine you failed to kill ian jennings who escaped into the back garden
3373061 im going to start working on gadgets formatted more for blogs and for the blogging community anyone have any interesting ideas you want me to help out with just leave comments on my blog and well see what develops
3373062 this is an insult what we are being put through today
3373063 its kind of a growing pain that we are experiencing
3373064 today were giving back a little bit here we were over the 1 300 level on the s amp p 500 yesterday that was looked at as a pretty good sign
3373065 how this story plays out really depends on whether the weakness in financials bleeds out to other sectors in the economy
3373066 long beach residents and children deserve nothing less than access to a downtown library with ready access to books and programs to help them achieve their goals
3373067 remove access to over 1 5 million books from one square mile of the city
3373068 it seems the mccain campaign has decided to take advantage of the violent conflict in georgia to
3373069 has twice spoken with the president of georgia and is working to prevent a close american ally from collapsing under the weight of a russian invasion
3373070 us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also been noticeably absent on the diplomatic scene having failed to interrupt her holidays to fly to tbilisi in support of the georgian government
3373071 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3373072 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3373073 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3373074 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3373075 over the years the endangered species act has become a regulatory nightmare that kills or stalls even the most well crafted land use projects
3373076 the economy suffers people suffer rational environmental planning suffers some careful streamlining is long overdue
3373077 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3373078 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3373079 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3373080 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3373081 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3373082 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3373083 great now i wont have to commit suicide ill be a hero and my family will get some insurance money
3373084 great now i wont have to commit suicide ill be a hero and my family will get some insurance money
3373085 thats good he was guilty and i dont know what else he could have pleaded
3373086 i think hes somebody who should never walk among us again hes been given chance after chance after chance he took the life of a friend an 18 year old girl with his bare hands
3373087 clark gregg choke director knew that id written choke while listening to radioheads 1993 debut album pablo honey with creep over and over and over
3373088 so clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits
3373089 apparently radiohead liked the movie so much theyve written the score
3373090 i quit believing in my own life at this point my life is just too incredible to be believable anymore its a living dream
3373091 i was working for a charity and wanted to go into teaching but you do need a specialist degree he says
3373092 id been teaching drama as a freelance for some time in schools and colleges and had an education certificate for that but most mainstream jobs needed a degree
3373093 i had a lot of experience after working in tv since the mid 1990s but when a cv doesnt have a degree at the top of it employers ignore it and it was getting more and more like that
3373094 it was all done and dusted within about six weeks this time last year i hadnt really thought about going back to university
3373095 i had to write to the university officially and the hardest part was knowing what to put in the letter
3373096 i should have done it 10 years ago but there wasnt a performing arts course then i would recommend it to any mature person really there are quite a few of us and everybodys so focused we know what were doing what we want and how to work on our own as well
3373097 its a big step but ive managed to get part time teaching work and a bit part in a local zombie film which supplements the student loan its tight but definitely worth it and the quality of life i have got is great
3373098 officers are keeping an open mind as to the significance of this find
3373099 however one possibility being considered is that the cat has been killed by those responsible for the murders
3373100 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was something frenzied
3373101 we will work around the clock to catch those responsible we have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case we have the support of the local community the area command policing and the people of newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime
3373102 he has certainly been subjected to an extensive assault which has caused very significant bruising to the forearm
3373103 at this stage we have no motive as to why these two people have been killed which could be properly put forward as a reason why they should be attacked with such brutality wade said
3373104 sometimes the police hold news conferences like this and go through the motions with the media when they already have it in the bag but this really is an undetected homicide
3373105 we are beginning to make inroads into their friends and associates but we are a long way short of establishing a motive for this crime and we are a long way short of arresting anyone
3373106 he will take a look at the sequence of events and give us some assistance into what happened
3373107 people are very subdued at the moment they are in mourning
3373108 yeah it was so great that you couldnt wait to leave
3373109 the horse is really young and im really pleased with him as he has never seen anything like this before
3373110 it has been a great competition and the atmosphere in this arena is electric
3373111 since we have a new board it would be normal course to discuss their goals with him
3373112 the respect you have shown to parents and staff is bar none
3373113 you always are ready always have an answer for parents
3373114 is there an open criminal investigation against the superintendent or anyone else is there anything fraudulent
3373115 his answer is no we do have a citizens complaint that we have done due diligence to look into
3373116 i have encouraged mr hess to bring this to a conclusion as quickly as possible lets bring harmony and unity to the school district
3373117 enable the two companies to benefit from the rapid development of a modern supply chain
3373118 it complements our entries into china and the us giving us access to another of the most important economies in the world

3373128 chrysler pt dream cruisers are about individuality and uniqueness and for 2009 we modernized our next factory customized edition
3373129 the new 2009 chrysler pt dream cruiser series 5 embodies a contemporary theme with a distinctive two tone exterior and the use of unique exterior and interior materials
3373130 our chrysler pt dream cruiser series 5 utilizes brilliant black crystal pearl to accentuate body lines while enhancing side rails and windows giving pt cruiser a sleek appearance with a visually lower roof
3373131 with the addition of 17 inch srt design wheels bold billet grilles inspired from the dub edition chrysler 300 chrome accents draped all over our midnight white pearl coat paint the latest dream cruiser delivers a new style that accentuates pt cruisers individuality
3373132 at least one from each major family in the series
3373133 they have a choice whether they want to sign up for our security research or whether they want to devote research engineers of their own to investigate the vulnerabilities
3373134 by combining the vulnerabilities with the series 40 issues one could develop malware which could be simply deployed and that malware wont be visible to the user
3373135 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3373136 nothing like having that unsettling phrase screaming out at you from your morning inbox for

3373140 oh no i cant tell you the guy whos in charge of making sure my manuscript is in good shape you might spoil it for everyone else

3373148 after the conference ends almost all of the delegates organizations and people from around the world will leave and mexicans will remain
3373149 in a country so rich and with so many natural resources
3373150 it is a crime that organizations and individuals that fight homophobia and discrimination do not receive the support from the government that they need
3373151 congratulations and jubilations i want the world to know i am as happy as can be

3373161 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain infineon is the 3g supplier
3373162 voor buitenstaanders is het misschien n pot nat wat lijn 5 en funx doen maar binnen het containerbegrip urban doen we iets heel anders funx heeft de laatste jaren veel publiek verzameld in de randstad terwijl lijn 5 in de relatieve luwte van radio 5 diepgang heeft gezocht wij kunnen dat goed gebruiken bij deze beslissing staat de inhoud voorop
3373163 funx richt zich op de opgroeiende jongeren lijn 5 spreekt dezelfde doelgroep aan op het moment dat ze volwassen geworden zijn
3373164 we zijn op dit moment gesprekken aan het voeren om tot een situatie te komen waar iedereen blij mee is ik ben ervan overtuigd dat dat gaat lukken
3373165 natuurlijk zullen er dingen veranderen maar lijn 5 heeft een vaste groep fans die we graag willen vasthouden
3373166 anders hadden ze bij funx beter gewoon een paar nieuwe djs aan kunnen nemen
3373167 i secured vauxhalls 100th victory at knockhill in 2006 so its a special track for me
3373168 similar to a rally circuit you have to drive aggressively to gain places through tight fast corners and also hold back the field using a defensive line i hope to extend my championship lead even further at knockhill but you have to be aware of the limitations of the car when carrying so much success ballast
3373169 if one does things hastily he will make a lot of mistakes he will need to spend a lot of time correcting those mistakes later

3373185 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime
3373186 it was just interesting to me that here we are trying to promote peace and harmony and were witnessing a conflict take place
3373187 unfortunately the trial court incorrectly held that trademark holders and not ebay are responsible for policing the ebay site the effect of this is that ebay can continue to profit at the expense of consumers and trademark holders
3373188 in our view this approach makes no sense as a matter of law or policy once ebay has reason to know that a specific brand like tiffany amp co is being widely counterfeited and sold ebay should be compelled to investigate and take action to protect its customers and stop the illegal conduct
3373189 trademark law does not impose a duty on tiffany to police ebays site ebay designed the site and has the responsibility to police it
3373190 well children we actually had to meet people in person and verbally converse with them to find out what their top three favorite albums were sure it was slower but much easier on the eyes you see people didnt dress up like their myspace page so we didnt have to look at gawdy and unreadable pink text on a pink background with an obnoxious animation tiled on it

3373212 we were farming communities some of us fled during the war while others arrived following the drought that hit the region
3373213 it seems the international community forgot us when siad barre was overthrown
3373214 things changed with barres removal from office since then we have not gotten much help only acpo a local ngo has supplied us with some food we could not flee the latest hostility in beletweyne because we are poor people and we dont know where to go

3373217 three cases have been found in the abidjan suburbs treichville and cocody at this stage 19 cases have been confirmed and 1 500 people have been vaccinated
3373218 despite a large vaccination campaign conducted in 2001 the rate of coverage is still only around 60 percent
3373219 the launch of the fta is the beginning of a process we need to embark on to build both our productive and trade capacity improve competitiveness of our industries and address the supply side constrains that inhabit us from benefiting our agriculture and industrial base to promote intra regional trade

3373233 i would definitely say that people arent as excited about going to minneapolis as they were about going to new york city
3373234 minneapolis is a nice city but it doesnt quite have the environment and reputation of a new york city and i think 2004 was a unique convention and a lot of it had to do with where it was
3373235 i have a lot of friends that are just not going that have gone in years past
3373236 we certainly werent alone a lot of venues hadnt heard anything and were kind of wondering what might of happened

3373242 the bottom line is that we see two groups of viewers one group who are interested in the facts and accuracy and they want to know what is real in a movie and what isnt the other group really isnt that concerned about the fact fiction divide and mostly just want to enjoy a fun story

3373246 the popularity of the iphone along with the emergence of various applications and faster connectivity makes it an ideal platform for developing applications that incorporate quality realtime voip giving consumers real world communication experiences like in game multiperson chat

3373257 i have a passion and an absolute love for radio we have looked at opportunities over the years but we have always turned them down because they were too expensive or too great a risk with original 106 we feel there is a reasonable chance with it
3373258 we know it is a tough time out there and that makes the challenge even more appealing
3373259 i love the immediacy of radio and the simplicity of what it does compared to the huge trundling machine that is television
3373260 one person and a microphone can inform a lot of people television requires an awful lot more preparation
3373261 i was on holiday with my wife in the south of france talking about whether to take the opportunity she is remarkably understanding but is sometimes concerned about the amount of time we are able to spend time together
3373262 she knew it is something i have always wanted to do from the day before i met her 30 years ago she understood i have got to do it
3373263 we determined that the prospects for fm radio in the uk were not consistent with the companys long term growth strategy

3373266 if speaker pelosi is truly sincere about having a vote on deep ocean oil and gas drilling to help bring down fuel costs she should use her power as speaker to call congress back into session immediately and schedule a vote on the american energy act
3373267 our message to speaker pelosi is very simple we are ready to vote on more energy production and lower gas prices right now and we should not wait one more day to begin giving the american people the relief they expect and deserve if you meant what you said last night we welcome you and your democratic colleagues to join us in our historic call to action on american energy end your five week break early and call congress back into session now so we can vote for more american made energy and lower gas prices without any further delay
3373268 t hey have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas well we can do that we can have a vote on that
3373269 in 2008 alone at least nine states have considered digital download taxes and at least five of those states have enacted them into law

3373419 those who would be at risk of re offending or who have a history of violence would certainly be high on a list to be on this program
3373420 he has pulled away from danger said the man who refused to give his name because he was not authorized to speak to the media
3373421 we are now waiting for him to wake up and speak so we can find out more details about what happened
3373422 it presents several new aspects which were not present in previous incidents in xinjiang bequelin said
3373423 one is the sophisticated co ordination of the attacks it was not just one attack its a string of bombings that requires much more planning and a larger organization to carry out especially at the time of the olympics when the security is so high
3373424 if you look at the streets everything seems calm and peaceful said one merchant who would only identify himself as amar because he feared retribution

3373435 is it wise to have a propane facility of this kind immediately adjacent to residential properties
3373436 obviously in light of what happened the answer is no
3373437 the yard had a right to be there a legal right
3373438 were going to investigate whether thats appropriate from the citys perspective were also going to work with the provincial regulator who oversees these kinds of facilities to make sure the regulations are being followed and are adequate to protect torontonians
3373439 at the federal level there are rules that govern the transportation of dangerous and toxic compounds and that includes propane
3373440 when a city is looking at where theyre going to locate a facility all of those federal rules and regulations are applied but its up to the city to actually make the rules
3373441 we have very strict regulations in place and a very robust safety system
3373442 if this is a 1 6 kilometre area of evacuation why isnt the propane yard 1 6 kilometres away
3373443 i was very surprised to the see the pictures of the explosion
3373444 its very typical of what youd normally see in this type of the facility when things go awry
3373445 something like 500 people died in that explosion and in toronto it could have been as bad as that
3373446 were just fortunate that our fire department was able to get a lot of water on these tanks when flame impinges on these pressurized tanks they literally explode sending shrapnel in all sorts of areas

3373473 our participation as sponsors of this event dovetails perfectly with our aim to actively engage with south africas publishing and media sector
3373474 we see platforms like this as essential for the growth of the industry and are very happy to support it
3373475 there are real opportunities for local media companies to pursue profitable digital publishing strategies importantly there are now capable south african service providers and software vendors that can assist them in achieving this goal
3373476 i wonder if anyone can see the beauty of it
3373477 ill only say this once ive never said it before this kind of certainty comes but just once in a lifetime
3373478 we had some heavy fire on the back side of the structure
3373479 we woke up to all these lights on our street and an ambulance in our front yard

3373489 nbc is spending more than 1 billion to broadcast the olympic games to the u s they believe footage available on other web sites would take away their audience
3373490 expands to any footage filmed within the accredited area or interviews conducted within the accredited area
3373491 an irish person via a mobile phone and they happened to be in an official olympic car we cannot play that interview outside of ireland
3373492 realistically this means we need to block all live streams radio and television because we cannot monitor all of the streams 24 hours
3373493 its not even common for the olympics no other sporting event in the world requires this level of restrictions including the 2004 games
3373494 were making more of these olympics available to american audiences by far than any olympics in history
3373495 it seems to me that sony has made a corporate decision to double down on recorded music
3373496 since its already in game platforms and electronics it seems theyre going back to the content is king strategy and taking the recorded music forward into these other platforms
3373497 sony will be attempting more aggressively with playstation network to create an internet distribution platform for content
3373498 music is a very popular form of content and they want to be well positioned as they roll that out i think this acquisition would be related to that
3373499 i was president of the torchbearers youth association the youth arm of the fnm about 27 years ago and i remember back then talking about the need to get young people involved
3373500 i say that only to say that you are indeed future leaders of our country
3373501 i believe that you need to be responsible in your dialogue and in your recommendations but you ought to be heard and that as you fight to be heard you will find that many of us as national leaders who have traveled the road that you are now travelling will be very supportive of your efforts in ensuring that you are heard
3373502 this is an opportunity for the young people to interrogate us per se on issues that you feel are most important to you
3373503 i am happy to be a part of this forum which has both sides of government here
3373504 from the mass numbers demonstrated here i can certainly say that all is not lost
3373505 this is an excellent idea and i would certainly be willing to participate in those yet to come
3373506 let me firstly say that we are putting various strategies in place to deal with school violence as the new school year is about to begin in terms of ensuring that our children and educators are safe

3373568 on a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone drops to zero
3373569 but look we put tools in to prevent x from happening
3373570 t he biggest mmos are teen oriented and this is something thats always been mysterious to me why are there hardly any kids in teen second life you make a good point but i wouldnt say second life has been marketed towards teens i guess the question i would ask is would you think second life is explicitly designed as a product for teens no its a platform that was designed for probably a more mature market than that and sometime ago for an early adopter market and so the experience hasnt been really tailored for a teen market so as a result as you say theyre a very small part of our market today were expanding the second life experience so its very very relevant for a user thats interested in participating but not necessarily creating and thats probably not going to be the teen consumer explicitly and singularly whereas some of the other offerings have been targeted specifically at the teen market we havent done that the teen markets going to be incredibly crowded and its going to be a lot of companies chasing a relatively small wallet
3373571 spamming is now done by organised crime using local gangs who know how to target customers and how to make their spam look legitimate
3373572 the type of emails are now more dangerous there are now more fraud emails rather than just spam offering you viagra
3373573 orange takes email spam very seriously we are an active member of the messaging anti abuse working group and deploy a mixture of proprietary and third party anti spam filtering software which we provide free to all our customers
3373574 with any automatic filtering there is a danger of it identifying email that the customer actually wants to see therefore we choose to tag the spam and deliver it to the inbox and make it a choice for the customer to turn on their anti spam settings via their webmail to deliver the tagged email to the junk folder
3373575 it tends to go in cycles who they target with gangs tending to target the banks with most publicity they will go for the biggest banks because theres so many more customers who are likely to click on an email
3373576 this research simply doesnt reflect our experience its an unreliable snapshot and rbs didnt even feature in their previous table for quarter one of this year
3373577 we have developed significant security processes to protect against this type of threat including sending more than two million card reader devices to our customers with the specific purpose of protecting them from online fraud such as phishing
3373578 for homeowners who need to sell this is a gravely serious situation it can also be harmful to communities where the number of unsold homes adds more to inventory and puts downward pressure on prices

3373594 we heard their concerns and we understand that taken out of context the site appeared to be insensitive to people with disabilities
3373595 is an r rated comedy that satirizes hollywood and its excesses makes its point by featuring inappropriate and over the top characters in ridiculous situations
3373596 i see no humor in making fun of anyone with a mental or physical disability
3373597 this is a disgustingly low portrayal of citizens who go through stares laughing and taunting on a daily basis dreamworks and mr stiller are choosing to hide behind their taunting under the auspices of comedic creativity when they are clearly stooping down to the schoolyard bully mentality and finding humor in mocking someone who cannot fight back as a society i keep hoping that we have at least moved forward and educated ourselves to have a modicum of compassion for those who are less fortunate than ourselves however it is clear that mr stillers writing team and the executives at dreamworks have never had to defend a sibling cousin or relative from verbal threats taunting and name calling with this film they are in fact those who are delivering those insults while asking the general public to pay and laugh with them the public should refuse to stoop so low
3373598 we are dismayed over what looks like an unnecessary and deliberate delay in setting her free

3373601 this is the first time ive decided to leave something i really truly love i will dearly miss getting a chance to work with
3373602 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3373603 ive never played singles at the olympics so this has been really cool for me
3373604 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3373605 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3373606 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3373607 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3373608 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency
3373609 i felt like any time that i needed to serve well i did if i was down love 30 or a 30 all point
3373610 thats good for me going on in the later rounds that im tough on my serve
3373611 i turned around to my dad and said thats exactly what i want to do
3373612 he goes its not how many times you get knocked down but its how many times you get back up and go forward carl latz said his son told him
3373613 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3373614 well the law prohibits it and the legislature enacted the laws to protect the health safety and welfare of all children
3373615 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3373616 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world

3373638 officers are keeping an open mind as to the significance of this find
3373639 however one possibility being considered is that the cat has been killed by those responsible for the murders
3373640 it was a vicious attack there was a lot of blood and i think in any interpretation that was something frenzied
3373641 we will work around the clock to catch those responsible we have a very experienced team of detectives working on this case we have the support of the local community the area command policing and the people of newcastle to catch whoever is responsible for this horrendous crime
3373642 he has certainly been subjected to an extensive assault which has caused very significant bruising to the forearm
3373643 at this stage we have no motive as to why these two people have been killed which could be properly put forward as a reason why they should be attacked with such brutality wade said
3373644 sometimes the police hold news conferences like this and go through the motions with the media when they already have it in the bag but this really is an undetected homicide
3373645 we are beginning to make inroads into their friends and associates but we are a long way short of establishing a motive for this crime and we are a long way short of arresting anyone
3373646 he will take a look at the sequence of events and give us some assistance into what happened
3373647 people are very subdued at the moment they are in mourning
3373648 its not at all surprising to see developers targeting these areas
3373649 particularly in older cities in europe and asia the red light district is where you often find many historic buildings and architectural landmarks and thats a very attractive selling point to builders and investors

3373667 generally breeding of these animals is especially difficult in captivity but currently with 23 clouded leopards howletts wild animal park is one of the very few zoos to have been successful in its breeding programme with no less than 30 births at the park since 2003
3373668 the aspinall foundation is proud of its breeding programme especially as in comparison to the rest of the world where no births were recorded by the us species survival plan during a 16 month period from 1 january 2006 through 1 april 2007 howletts recorded five successful births
3373669 the leaf is the food factory of the tree and so as the nights draw in and the temperatures start to fall the tree realises autumn is approaching
3373670 since trees do not grow during this period the factory closes down and the leaves begin to die
3373671 theres always an element of this in august but this year people are clearly desperate to get away from the rain
3373672 the seasons seem to be extending you get a spring summer for two months and then youre right into autumn for three or four months
3373673 they really do need a sustained period of sunshine now

3373690 what shocked me was that within 24 hours one half of those arrested 200 people had been whisked away to texas to send them back out of the country as soon as possible
3373691 bond is important because it starts the whole process of realizing the rights you are guaranteed by the constitution of the united states
3373692 i couldnt have continued caring for my family they had no idea what had happened with me but this way at least my children can see me in person
3373693 if you consider the fact that many of these same people have spent large amounts of money to get smugglers to bring them into the country in the first place forfeiting their half of the bond probably isnt going to be a major deterrent to not showing up to their court dates
3373694 i was excited when i found out i was selected

3373699 falling inflation suggests that the governments macro tightening measures have been effective which will both reduce investor fears of the possibility of policy missteps and increase the chances of a shift to targeted pro growth policies
3373700 the focus will now switch to the high cost of raw materials where prices remain elevated despite coming off recent peaks
3373701 i would never give it up not unless i was dying of alcohol poisoning or something
3373702 its inelastic demand as far as many of these stocks are concerned
3373703 so far theres signs that they are holding up although theres still concern that these industries will see some impact
3373704 id rather spend 4 or 5 on quality beer than 3 on hopped up water
3373705 its worth the extra buck or two to get quality
3373706 were going to stop buying silly things like that as opposed to giving up going out for a drink
3373707 cigarettes in general can withstand such an environment better than many consumer products

3373709 the odd bar of chocolate is not going to break the bank
3373710 i always have a piece a day and i cant see that changing
3373711 the sound of your voice is projected out across the fjord the valley and the village of dale below
3373712 received word of a game called victim that may have been going on at the time
3373713 thats clearly not the case violent crime has been with us forever and it will continue to be with us forever
3373714 when you compare the crime rate around the world what do you see
3373715 getting good statistics is very difficult and the way that nations count just varies incredibly
3373716 where you see major social upheavals indeed youll see spikes in homicide rates
3373717 we have a higher firearm homicide rate than many of those nations so that is part of it but it is also some aspects of american lifestyle we do tend to be out quite a bit and out in dangerous places quite frequently
3373718 the trend is overall quite good in the last 30 years crime rates have gone down significantly in the united states and they havent across the rest of the world
3373719 i think for sociologists who study crime the big question is not why do people deviate its what keeps us in check almost all of the time
3373720 although turkey doesnt like the present regime it has always tried to keep iranians both at bay and collaborate with them it is an extremely delicate balancing act and it will continue to be so
3373721 the visit is all about controlled risks and the most important aspect is a gas deal with iran not the nuclear program because turkey has little influence on that
3373722 ankara definitely does not sympathize with the theodemocracy theocracy partial democracy of iran but not having a hostile attitude against iran is important for turkeys domestic stability as well as its energy needs
3373723 will the visit really help turkey i doubt it its more beneficial for ahmadinejad hell get another 15 minutes in the spotlight when he unleashes his trademark attacks against israel and the united states
3373724 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3373725 i think this is an indication of the type of people we house at our detention facility and the kind of danger than our corrections officers men and women face everyday
3373726 you have it in your power to make your days on earth a path of flowers instead of a path of thorns
3373727 i know that there are interested parties who read media so its not good to say exactly where the hosting is
3373728 the attackers have inserted a large image made up of several smaller side by side images of pictures of both the georgian president and adolf hitler
3373729 separate groups of georgian armed forces are periodically trying to shoot at russian positions in various locations in south ossetia
3373730 we are somewhat perplexed by the modest silence of the belarussian side you need to express yourself more clearly on such issues especially as we have a union state
3373731 i condemn this terrorist attack that targeted us and this is not the first attempt
3373732 is not going to sway us from continuing our course of imposing security through operation good omen
3373733 we must capture or kill the hard core terrorists that are residing now out in the hinterlands
3373734 despite the russian presidents claims earlier this morning that military operations against georgia have been suspended at this moment russian fighter jets are bombarding two georgian villages outside south ossetia
3373735 we will need more evidence everyone in this situation needs a signed binding agreement
3373736 until that happens we are mobilized we are prepared for everything
3373737 i do appreciate it medvedevs gesture but there has been more damage to infrastructure and civilian casualties today
3373738 it could be that the executive order hasnt trickled down to the rank and file or it could mean something else
3373739 finally the international community began to speak with one voice and is beginning to get the message through that this behavior is unacceptable
3373740 president saakashvili has signed the four point kouchner plan which is being discussed in moscow right now signing that would be a start
3373741 the international community must succeed in bringing a durable and proper end to this
3373742 mr solana welcomed this decision he recalled the importance of peace and stability in the region and expressed the eus readiness to contribute actively to a solution to the crisis
3373743 large parts of the georgian military have been knocked out by the russian air and ground attacks
3373744 the goal appears to be to damage georgia militarily and economically to such an extent that its capacity to resist politically is severely weakened after that i expect political conditions for an end to the conflict will be dictated
3373745 the first unhcr humanitarian airlift flight carrying relief supplies for civilians affected by the south ossetia conflict arrived in georgia this morning as the estimated number of people uprooted by the fighting approached 100 000
3373746 that would amount to some 56 000 people from gori on the move officials said most had gone toward tbilisi and that most would return home once the threat subsided
3373747 the situation on the ground is deteriorating sparking a significant movement of population
3373748 we need unrestricted humanitarian access to the civilian population and to the wounded and to enable medical personnel and ambulances to take care of the dead and wounded
3373749 one of our top priorities when it is possible will be to get safe drinking water to tskhinvali
3373750 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history it is a pretty amazing accomplishment
3373751 this gold medal is the best present for the president and for the people of the country
3373752 we two are very close and happy we both got medals
3373753 it has been a long journey a long eight years
3373754 ive gone from a naive 14 year old to an under pressure 18 year old in athens and now a relieved 22 year old
3373755 it is very important that all parties go back to the status quo ante that is as it existed on august 6
3373756 the palestinian side will only accept a palestinian state with territorial continuity with holy jerusalem as its capital without settlements and on the june 4 1967 boundaries
3373757 at the opening ceremony they cordoned off an area at the back of the stadium for smokers it did last nearly five hours
3373758 id say 70 out of 100 athletes in the olympic village smoke
3373759 just having the mandatory non smoking signs up has discouraged smokers somewhat
3373760 i will not announce a success before the ink is dry but the information we are getting makes the acceptance of my governments demands by the u s more probable than only a few weeks ago
3373761 raise the banner of jihad and let us bleed and have our limbs severed until we bring back a caliphate styled along the lines of the prophets way
3373762 wake up and prepare for the war the cross is marching towards you
3373763 wherever we find them we will arrest them and bring them to justice
3373764 those regimes that enslave their people have always raised the banner of democracy in their fight against islam while people see that most of them assumed power through military coups
3373765 the tidal wave is sweeping the country even his own former allies are now voting against him
3373766 this is no time for confrontation and we want to strengthen the democratic process thats why we have decided to support the impeachment motion
3373767 we saw the reporting and the announcement from the russian president medvedev
3373768 were trying to get an assessment of what exactly it means what a halt means and whether its taken place
3373769 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon
3373770 i suspect that long before we get to the summit there will be some decision coming out of zimbabwe
3373771 i dont foresee a total breakdown where there would essentially be war on the streets or at least very high levels of repression and exclusion
3373772 i dont think they talks will remain on the rocks because i think all the parties eventually have no way out of it other than talking to each other
3373773 immediately dismantle all torture camps and bases throughout the country and prosecute those responsible for torture and other mistreatment
3373774 the bottom line is there are still offerings out there but most of the action we see is with siebel on premise or oracle on demand
3373775 theres not enough independent validation that that stuff meets the bar those offerings cant keep pace with siebel or oracle on demand or the rest of the market for that matter
3373776 what its done is given people who have implemented sap as a suite the opportunity to go back to their users and say hey look at the improvements here this is not the typical sap youve known
3373777 microsoft is clearly breathing down siebels and salesforce coms neck here
3373778 netsuite has done ok but theyre in the broader erp suite play sugarcrm innovated with open source but here again when i get called on short lists the typical suspects always pop up
3373779 if you look at sfa its going to be very hard to compete without an on demand offering
3373780 salesforce oracle microsoft netsuite pivotal sage even sap all these guys they all have on demand options the writings clearly on the wall
3373781 what its done is given people who have implemented sap as a suite the opportunity to go back to their users and say hey look at the improvements here this is not the typical sap youve known

3373785 salesforce oracle microsoft netsuite pivotal sage even sap all these guys they all have on demand options the writings clearly on the wall
3373786 i think it can be number one on the charts
3373787 i think you all have too much time on your hands and need to get some lives
3373788 i picked it up wrapped it and never even noticed
3373789 she opened it on christmas morning she put it on and our son noticed it was wrong

3373805 bayh supported an unpopular war i did too and still do
3373806 bayh was a co chairman on a neocon committee i know because i served alongside him

3373812 well done john that is an outstanding piece of work
3373813 i just read your blog about bair vs darer great stuff
3373814 in all affairs its a healthy thing now and then to hang a question mark on the things you have long taken for granted
3373815 el desarrollo de la 550 lleg a su techo y como en 2010 habr un nuevo reglamento t cnico para que estos autos tambi n puedan correr en le mans ferrari no est dispuesta a prepara otro modelo

3373822 the opening ceremony was a long time for the athletes to be on their feet it was very hot and there were not a lot of fluids around
3373823 it is something we will have to talk about after the games if i was a coach in charge of a team with that heat and that amount of standing around i would think that it was a lot
3373824 you dont often do something like that a week or two weeks out from a big event you wouldnt normally do that its things like that we have got to have a good look at apparently its nothing new the same thing has happened before and happened four years ago
3373825 i can see that when we go back home in september these things could be forgotten but i wont forget them because thats why im here im having a really good look at all of this stuff
3373826 no athletes who were competing in the next 48 hours were there but even for the others and even for the officials it was a very long time on your feet i will make my report back to the boa and all the national governing bodies and uk sport to make sure that we dont forget some key lessons these have been good and bad because some really good things have happened that i have been really impressed with all the accommodation for example has been top drawer and the team working together across sports has been excellent
3373827 its the symbolic start of the games and you get a big kick out of it if you can make it but it simply involves too much standing around in the heat
3373828 its not just the two hours after youve walked into the stadium either so many athletes go from the village that you have to queue to get on a bus sit in traffic with hundreds of other buses and then stand around in an enormous waiting area before you finally file into the stadium
3373829 by the time you get home youll have been on your feet for six or seven hours and thats no good to us this close to competition
3373830 i am proud of our research and development team being the first company to release gis capability for sending alerts to workstations is a substantial accomplishment and milestone for the company a number of new geospatial viewing tools from major companies in the internet have recently been introduced to industry and are taking the geospatial world by storm google yahoo microsoft and amazon have all released web based mapping tools in the former year and this trend has raised the bar for internet mapping desktop alert now puts into effect these technologies and extends gis capabilities beyond that of traditional gis vendors the new gis capability is a boon for our military customers operating bases in battle zones who require quick situational awareness and response capabilities desktop alert will continue to lead as a pioneer in first to market technologies
3373831 about two thirds of corporations operating in the united states did not pay taxes annually from 1998 to 2005 according to a new report
3373832 the gao did not analyze whether the firms had profits that should have been taxed
3373833 corporations gave a variety of reasons on their tax returns to account for the absence of taxable revenue the most frequently listed included the cost of producing their goods salary expenses and interest payments on their debt the report said
3373834 it would have been refreshing if at least one of the worshipful media folk at the press conference had replied well actually brett youre here because after months of vacillating on your retirement and putting the packers through hell and forcing them into using a valuable draft pick on an extra quarterback because they didnt know whether youd be playing for them this season you tried to bully them into either making you the starter or trading you to a team of your choice
3373835 once again another loser that doesnt know crap about brett favre lets see if this b tch is complaining when
3373836 the vb1257 blade effectively leverages vmware virtualization to solve the problems known in the data center today such as server sprawl power and cooling issues and operating costs enabling customers to achieve greater density and server utilization
3373837 we are pleased that verari systems is helping to deliver added value to customers with innovative technology combined with the significant business benefits of vmware virtualization including lower capital and operating expenses business continuity strengthened security and reduced energy consumption
3373838 the practical benefits of well executed vmware installations have received much coverage and include lower capital and operating expenses improved floor space efficiency and contributing to the demand to be greener that is so prevalent these days
3373839 those same benefits can be extended by users who choose to combine the software with hardware platforms exemplified by verari systems bladerack 2 server and storage systems that have a similar focus and can deliver benefits in the same area verari systems platforms can run twice the usual number of virtual machines per blade which means not only less capital expense for users but also reductions in the associated ongoing operational and environmental costs verari systems has reported strong demand for its bladerack 2 platforms most likely this is driven by giving users an attractive combination of technologies that combine with vmware to help deliver even stronger business value
3373840 verari systems bladerack 2 x series solutions for vmware environments offers customers increased performance scalability and energy efficiency and ultimately more value than similar servers on the market
3373841 in addition to more memory compute density and storage capacity than the competition our blade server innovations also enable customers to fully realize the benefits of virtualization and energy efficiency
3373842 ive been to game events where people would come by and say oh these games are in japanese and then just leave
3373843 otakon is the best for us it kills over the game conventions
3373844 the people here are passionate about it and you dont see that in some of the industry stuff

3373851 although last night was about your book and you i left thinking about how god wants to use me and my relationship with him thanks for taking your platform and using it to point us to something bigger than you
3373852 i think its more an attitude and the way we see life than the actual music
3373853 the way we party our parents grew up in the revolutionary period of tropic lia
3373854 and when youre a teenager you just want to listen to the opposite
3373855 i remember loving the beatles when i was a kid and asking my mom to translate everything and my favorite song was like the most stupid song ever
3373856 in portuguese i curse a lot but in english it doesnt work to be like fucking fucking fucking i didnt have no idea in the last songs i know they were dirty words but now i can feel the weight of them

3373858 im not against public transportation i used it for many years
3373859 but we oppose it the road is not wide enough its too narrow so its a public safety issue
3373860 this is a parkway filled with walkers bikers stroller bladers you know quiet activities
3373861 mr loring and mr wirth wanted this as a place for quiet and reflection
3373862 we wanted to propose a solution and not just say we are against it
3373863 when we marketed the citizens of that broad geographical area they wanted to routes to hook up with the robbinsdale transit center that was a popular request
3373864 the notes show tojo kept his died in the wool militarist mentality until the very end
3373865 we now have to see our country surrender to the enemy without demonstrating our power up to 120 percent
3373866 we are now on a course for a humiliating peace or rather a humiliating surrender
3373867 being scared of enemy threats and easily throwing their hands up
3373868 frightened by the new type of bomb and terrified by the soviet unions entry into the war
3373869 many soldiers and the people cannot bring themselves to die until the goal is achieved
3373870 now that the diplomatic steps have been taken after the emperors judgment i have decided to refrain from making any comments about it though i have a separate view
3373871 moral responsibility for causing useless deaths even though they were meant to be sacrifice for a great cause
3373872 after several tests we decided to put lin miaoke on the live picture while using seven year old yang peiyis voice
3373873 the reason for this is that we must put our countrys interest first
3373874 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi we combined the perfect voice and the perfect performance
3373875 pavarottis great career therefore ended with a virtual performance something sad but inevitable
3373876 previously recorded footage was provided to the broadcasters for convenience and theatrical effects

3373878 participation in the future consolidation of the u s banking market

3373883 i didnt feel any pressure i was lagging behind in the first round
3373884 my coach told me to be more aggressive and more active in attacking so i did and the rest of the bout went smoothly
3373885 there was so much going on in the crowd i just stood there at the end i thought i was up
3373886 i feel like i should have been up every round and every round was tied
3373887 i felt like the scoring wasnt right because i worked so hard for this and to come this far and lose in the first round it isnt right it doesnt seem real to me
3373888 maybe our defense is not good enough or maybe our cooperation is not good enough
3373889 this is incredibly detailed was he here and whats our responsibility to readers should we take the enquirer allegations just as they are or should we you know do our own investigation try to confirm independently
3373890 basically you know were you at the hilton this night were you there
3373891 ive always felt like we have the best fans in the nfl and that they would support our team regardless of how they feel about myself or brett or management or whatever
3373892 but it was a great reception when we took the field
3373893 i understand the attention around him his performance tonight and him playing tonight
3373894 but i saw aaron just like he is every day i thought he went out there he played with excellent energy which i always recall him playing with i think hes done a really good job being consistent and understanding that the microscope is on him with all the attention but those are really outside external forces that we cant really pay attention to
3373895 offensively we got off to a slow start but we picked up the pace as the half went on
3373896 first step was for scientists and engineers to realize that in complex issues uncertainty ignorance and indeterminacy are always present in what she described as a call for humility in her nature essay she urged researchers to cultivate and teach modes of knowing that are often pushed aside in expanding scientific understanding and technological capacity including history moral philosophy political theory and social studies of science what people value and why they value it
3373897 the world can be divided in many ways rich and poor democratic and authoritarian but one of the most striking is the divide between the societies with an individualist mentality and the ones with a collectivist mentality
3373898 weve seen displays of mass conformity before but this opening ceremony was collectivism of the present a high tech vision of the harmonious society performed in the context of chinas miraculous growth the rise of china isnt only an economic event its a cultural one the ideal of a harmonious collective may turn out to be as attractive as the ideal of the american dream

3373900 what if we let athletes do whatever they wanted to excel
3373901 their advice offered a look at the potential downside of cancer screening and our seemingly endless quest to detect cancer early in otherwise healthy people in this case for men 75 and older the united states preventive services task force concluded that screening for prostate cancer does more harm than good 75 is the age at which the risks clearly begin to outweigh the benefits and the disease if detected would most likely not have a meaningful effect on life expectancy
3373902 weve done a great job in public health convincing people that cancer screening tests work
3373903 were uncomfortable with the notion that some screening tests work and others dont that seems mystifying to people

3373906 richmond has more in culture history and business than all those cities cited by rove put together and so perhaps mr rove would like to come see how terrific a place this is the capital city of virginia rather than just taking shots on a news show
3373907 richmond residents chastise rove for his patronizing and belittling comments about their city
3373908 cynical and misguided viewpoint out of touch with america and the real people with real problems who reside there
3373909 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
3373910 in belittling richmonds size rove shows hes out of touch
3373911 it appears that karl rove will swiftboat anyone including cities

3373913 if i speak about it what will be left for chiranjeevi to say
3373914 continuing inflationary pressures indicate persistence of the tight monetary stance growth is slowing slightly but the main concern is the worsening fiscal situation as subsidies are used to suppress inflation
3373915 with countries allowing domestic fuel prices to increase even partially there is little question that as long as oil prices remain at current levels or even decline moderately the price adjustments will keep up the pressure on inflation rates across the region this puts the spotlight on monetary policy
3373916 with the exception of new zealand every country we cover has begun raising policy rates and is expected to continue to do so for the rest of 2008
3373917 however high interest rates and rising inflation are expected to hinder consumer spending and corporate investment in 2008 and 2009
3373918 we are hoping to have one of the biggest and the best womens football clubs in the country
3373919 we already have a girls centre of excellence training the best of the regions young footballers this link up will mean we also have an academy for older girls to progress to
3373920 training facilities are very hard to come by so the opportunity to train on a third generation artificial pitch will make a big difference
3373921 we hope to support the club in extending the range of services it offers through our range of sports qualifications
3373922 members of the academy will not only be able to access a range of college courses but will also receive expert coaching sports injury support and the opportunity to participate within national leagues and competitions
3373923 i read that too michele that is what made me think of it

3373925 en relaci n al tercer trimestre hasta la fecha la condiciones del mercado se han deteriorado considerablemente respecto al segundo trimestre particularmente los diferenciales sobre valores respaldados por hipotecas se han ampliado de manera acusada provocando que la entidad incurra en p rdidas de aproximadamente 1 500 millones de d lares en lo que va de trimestre
3373926 actuales previsiones contemplan el mantenimiento del deterioro de la econom a de eeuu as como que los mercados de capitales contin en bajo presi n al mismo tiempo que se mantiene la ca da de de precios inmobiliarios estos factores han afectado y probablemente continuar n afectando negativamente a las cuentas de la entidad

3373943 als aufsichtsratsvorsitzender der austrian airlines und als iag chef gezeigt dass er nicht der richtige mann f r die durchaus delikate aufgabe ist den bundesanteil der aua zu ver u ern
3373944 nur eine rasche und ehrliche vollprivatisierung also ein strategischer partner kann die probleme der aua l sen
3373945 in das letzte match k nnen wir nur voll motiviert reingehen
3373946 wir schauen dass wir eine gescheite vorbereitung auf das spiel haben und eine gescheite videoanalyse machen dass wir eine gute taktik haben und dann schauen wir dass wir das umsetzen k nnen damit wir gegen sie gewinnen
3373947 ich war nicht ganz zufrieden mit meinen side out spiel aber mit dem spiel insgesamt k nnen wir schon zufrieden sein
3373948 public place copies or those given away by a third party partner
3373949 when they were both about to leave they had a heated argument outside the restaurant they were doing a good amount of yelling
3373950 this success was due primarily to pockets exceptional operating performance during this time
3373951 we remain committed to financing strong business models such as pockets within the wireless communications industry
3373952 we looked at the track record of cit in the communications space and were confident that they could provide us with the financing we needed to continue our success
3373953 ill do anything for carrie ill sit out here all night

3373955 the guys have been chirping me at practice about it but we all know we have to focus on the tri nations
3373956 the next three weeks and that all starts this saturday and winning here at newlands
3373957 but of course playing my 100th test is obviously a great achievement for me
3373958 and to be running out at newlands my home ground and against a side like new zealand will be extra special
3373959 its always been a dream to play for the boks and to play as a professional because i have managed to look after myself ive been able to keep on going well into my thirties
3373960 just look at george gregan hes gone back to japan to play for another two years and thats a good example of a guy that has looked after himself after years of international rugby i like to think ive done the same
3373961 it may have rejuvenated me after four or five years of international rugby fatigue couldve been setting in
3373962 the key to returning in 2004 under jake white was that i had a good pre season and my fitness came through from there
3373963 it was easy to come back when peter de villiers approached me
3373964 i love playing for my country and i know ive got a lot to offer younger players like frans steyn ruan pienaar and conrad jantjes
3373965 those guys are playing some fantastic rugby so maybe its time for me to stop standing in their way and call it a day
3373966 his honesty stands out for me you always know where you stand with him
3373967 im also enjoying playing some expansive rugby im still learning as you always do under a new coach
3373968 we dont have a player that has reached a milestone of 100 caps yet for this country
3373969 but come kick off on saturday south africa will definitely have one and the focus is just to get through these next few days of training
3373970 i dont think it could happen to a greater rugby player like monty
3373971 the professional player that he is now and the experience that he brings to the side is priceless
3373972 what makes him so extraordinary is the fact that he is prepared to share all his knowledge to everybody in the side hes not the kind of guy to keep everything to himself
3373973 even when hes not playing percy is the same person the same character you cant read anything on his face
3373974 we all know percys strengths and he helped us in dunedin when he started and the boks beat the all blacks we will need to use those attributes again this weekend
3373975 i am blessed to work with people like monty and this week is going to be huge for him
3373976 the only thing i can do is support him this week and try to get him at his best as well as keep him calm
3373977 i know it must be a whirlwind of emotions going on inside him right now
3373978 but again i know his character he knows that the job at hand at beating the all blacks is more important than individual milestones
3373979 thats not to say that the team and myself arent looking forward to sharing this massive achievement with him
3373980 theres a lot of big names in the changing room especially the ones in the welsh team
3373981 and having played against them countless times either with ireland or ulster its nice to be on the same side as them now
3373982 im 24 now im in a good spell of form and its time for me to test myself against the best certainly by competing for my place with some of the players here that is exactly what i will be doing
3373983 it was difficult with ulster last year things didnt go as we would have wanted and it was tough towards the end of the season
3373984 i could easily have stayed at ulster enjoyed my rugby there and without sounding big headed been confident of keeping my shirt for the majority of the games but i wanted to take my career to the next level here
3373985 theres a lot of competition for places at the ospreys and its going to be tough getting into the first xv
3373986 obviously this club has come away with silverware for the last three seasons now its a case of moving that on to the next stage and europe is obviously a priority
3373987 wir m chten uns bei euch f r euer mitgef hl eure anteilnahme und euren schutz aufs herzlichste bedanken ihr habt uns in der schwersten zeit sehr viel kraft und sicherheit vermittelt
3373988 sie ist eine extrem starke gefestigte frau die auf ihre kinder h lt und sich r hrend um sie k mmert
3373989 eine katze ein vogel das alles war ihnen ja nur aus dem fernsehen bekannt
3373990 i have been fiddling the books for years and i cant live with it any more i want to confess
3373991 one can well understand the reaction in a small community to what he has done he has gone from being a popular and quite well known figure to where he is ostracised by many people
3373992 you never really know why somebody wants to be around you or if they do genuinely like you
3373993 i wish everyone had a label on their forehead so you could automatically tell their intentions sometimes you just wish that no one wanted anything from you
3373994 we were both small town people doing very big things and we relied on each other dealing with fame
3373995 i dont know the phone will ring and itll be him and ill maybe not answer
3373996 i dont want to name names even though he probably deserves it but he fooled around
3373997 oh yeah and lied it was one of those things that everyone knew but me he was a good liar nobody would come out and tell me and he seemed perfect in every way
3373998 im sure weve all run into these people whether theyre friends boyfriends or girlfriends
3373999 weil es sich um einen v llig unvorhergesehenen fall handelt wir m ssen mit respekt f r die schwierige lage in georgien abwarten wie die uefa entscheiden wird
3374000 da die grenze zu georgien nur 250 kilometer entfernt ist sind sehr viele menschen hierher geflohen alles ist voll
3374001 es gibt mehr im leben als den t glichen verkehr zu beobachten und streunende katzen an sich urinieren zu lassen
3374002 the grant centers on things that already are important to the school district the goals of increasing academic success for all students strengthening student student and student adult relationships and improving post secondary outlooks
3374003 working with a grant is a good sign and provides some resources toward the improvements of our high schools but there is a lot of important work that goes ahead in the next five years
3374004 they are extremely close a number of members of the hollywood community including brad pitt ben affleck and matt damon offered to help raise funds for barack but it was with george that he struck up this amazing affinity
3374005 we realize consumers these days arent going to have a pocket full of cash we want to move to a cashless cabin
3374006 i just remember after i got my medal i walked back to the ready room where we were sitting and everyone said let me see let me see and i held up the jersey

3374012 the fcc s tests of prototype white space devices at fedex field prior to saturday s game between the redskins and the bills conclusively show that spectrum sensing white space devices will cause harmful interference to wireless microphones during live events
3374013 you will see a lot more guys making the switch
3374014 since i made the switch ive had guys who i dont want to name ringing me up and saying they are interested in coming over to union
3374015 they see that union is at a really good level now whereas five years ago maybe the premiership was a little lower profile but the game has really picked up
3374016 myself and lesley had talked about wanting to switch codes he left bradford earlier than planned but we kept close contact
3374017 i knew i wanted to make the switch as well so having decided that it was then about finding a club that was going to suit me
3374018 i had a couple of agents looking for me and when the opportunity arose to come to bath after olly barkley had signed for gloucester i knew it was the place i wanted to be
3374019 the reason why i chose to switch now was because i felt i had achieved everything at bradford and i felt it was better to do it now rather than leave it to a later date and think what if
3374020 all the feedback from lesley about rugby union was positive and i thought i would really like to be in that position as well
3374021 for me it is about making the switch learning the rules and my first goal of making the bath starting line up
3374022 you cant really ask someone if they want to play for england if they are sitting in the stand watching
3374023 we expect that within the next three six months symbian and android will combine to provide a single open source os

3374025 having good morning america and cmt insider broadcast our cma awards final nominees live brings a heightened level of excitement to these highly anticipated announcements
3374026 these special broadcasts will allow fans across the nation to experience the same excitement our artists and industry feel as the names are announced for the first time by our hosts it also demonstrates the enthusiasm of our network partner abc and the continued and valued support of good morning america and cmt
3374027 were excited to be a part of the live cma nominee announcements on good morning america
3374028 we had our first cma win in 2002 and know how thrilling it is to hear your name called out as a nominee so were glad to be the ones to share that good news
3374029 cma provided me with one of the most amazing moments of my life and its an honor to be asked to announce this years nominees with my tour mates rascal flatts
3374030 we are so honored to have been asked by cma to help them make this announcement
3374031 the cma awards are something weve dreamed about being a part of since charles dave and i sat down to write our first song together it is truly one of the most anticipated events of the year and we are excited that we get to call the nominees names
3374032 this is country musics biggest night what an honor to be asked to participate in announcing the cma award nominations
3374033 i dont think there is a country artist out there including myself who hasnt dreamed of winning a cma award to be asked to announce the nominees names that morning with lady antebellum is a moment i will always remember
3374034 for the past two years being out at country radio i get to see for myself every day how hard these people work and how difficult their jobs can be
3374035 country radio has been really amazing to me so its very cool to get to announce the deserving nominees and share in their excitement
3374036 i am thrilled to be able to announce the broadcast nominees
3374037 country radio has been so supportive of me and my music and i have made so many amazing relationships over this last year that i cant think of a better way to show my appreciation than to be a part of these special announcements
3374038 the cma awards are country musics biggest night and this is certainly going to be country musics biggest morning
3374039 i cant imagine a more exciting way to kick off the cma awards season and the excitement leading up to the 42nd annual cma awards
3374040 we really need to know what the risk is being lean doesnt mean you arent at risk and we are now starting to understand obesity a whole lot better
3374041 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3374042 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3374043 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3374044 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3374045 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3374046 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3374047 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3374048 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3374049 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3374050 he pokes his head out occasionally but thats about it
3374051 the bottom line is there are still offerings out there but most of the action we see is with siebel on premise or oracle on demand
3374052 theres not enough independent validation that that stuff meets the bar those offerings cant keep pace with siebel or oracle on demand or the rest of the market for that matter
3374053 what its done is given people who have implemented sap as a suite the opportunity to go back to their users and say hey look at the improvements here this is not the typical sap youve known
3374054 microsoft is clearly breathing down siebels and salesforce coms neck here

3374080 che sin dallinizio ci siamo impegnati a confrontare questi testi con le organizzazioni di volontariato cattoliche e non che sono impegnate in prima linea nella lotta contro la povert urbana
3374081 noi giochiamo coi soldatini lo vadano a dire ai cittadini a me sembra che ci siano reminiscenze pseudo ideologiche che vengono da sinistra ma anche da certi cattocomunisti con il solito atteggiamento post sessantottino duro a morire

3374083 there was a long steady cam shot where a young christian bale is coming into this american barracks

3374088 the present is stronger and the future is brighter for the united way of the national capital area i am looking forward to joining the united way of america team and furthering my career with the agency
3374089 because they want to perform better but at the same time they get more supporters from the audience and the chinese people i think great athletes dont mind who cheers they concentrate on one thing competition
3374090 i think that self improvement is important you have to control yourself very well dont get too excited because some are young they cant control themselves too well they have to save their energy
3374091 there are some gold medals in these olympics which are so easy to predict that its surprising that the medal

3374176 it is absolutely traumatic especially for the grandmother because they have a visa for a limited period of time
3374177 what happens if the period expires how do they manage the problem where do they leave the baby where does the baby stay who cares for the baby
3374178 i think obviously india owes an obligation to speed up the legal and judicial process so that the child is able to travel as soon as possible
3374179 i am very worried and stressed why cant they let her father take his child
3374180 i think this should end there should be stricter laws
3374181 half of the citizenship cases that they do now in mumbai are from surrogates
3374182 i will not leave india without her no matter what
3374183 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3374184 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3374185 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3374186 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3374187 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3374188 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3374189 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3374190 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3374191 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3374192 if youre a betting person and you look at the numbers and the fact that most pardons have landed in december i think there is every reason to expect there are some pardons ahead
3374193 i will do so in a fair way i will have the highest of standards
3374194 our country has long turned a blind eye to the misdeeds of our heroes
3374195 but it is not the ultimate fate of richard nixon that most concerns me my concern is the immediate future of this great country
3374196 but i have concluded that the prison sentence given to mr libby is excessive
3374197 has been very cautious done very little that would get him into any trouble
3374198 youve never heard of only their hometown neighbours would know who they are
3374199 to giving each clemency petition careful review as the historical figures demonstrate a commutation of sentence is an extraordinary remedy that is rarely granted
3374200 he cannot be faulted for a parsimonious pardoning record because there were not as many applications then
3374201 and he did not get that many favourable recommendations from the justice department he granted all of the pardons that were recommended to him by the justice department
3374202 everybody seems to expect that the president is going to do a lot at the end of his term
3374203 growing up where i did forced us to think locally but when my children get older i want them to see the olympics i want them to know that its the pinnacle of your achievement this gives them something to strive for not just in athletics but in life a way of thinking
3374204 for anyone working in a professional environment it is important to stay abreast to whats happening in the world
3374205 so most of my african american friends who are professionals will tune in they will care and know at least some of whats happening
3374206 as a youth growing up in jamaica i couldnt wait for the olympics it was a matter of national pride
3374207 primarily basketball im looking forward to it all especially the soccer
3374208 everyone is watching men and women they can tell you about different events throughout the day
3374209 the olympics will always be relevant on a world stage its just that sometimes in the united states as a whole people dont always pay attention to the games
3374210 im gong to watch mens soccer for sure some basketball some beach volleyball most of the finals
3374211 this is a chance for the world to see what china has to offer
3374212 chinese companies are seeking to expand globally this will only increase business opportunities in the future
3374213 he is willing to return and since he is determined he is an asset
3374214 we have decided not to link the payment of his fine with his selection
3374215 shoaib gul and afridi carry a lot of experience and we are confident they will be 100 percent fit for the tournament
3374216 her name must be put in nomination and there must be a roll call vote allowing the delegates senator clinton has earned and who represent more than 18 million democratic voters to cast their votes the representation of those 18 million democratic voters is the only acceptable means for conducting the convention regardless of outcome and the only acceptable means that is in accordance with the democratic process
3374217 senator obama howard dean and some in the dnc would prefer if senator clintons name were not placed in nomination democratic principles and processes demand otherwise neither candidate has enough pledged delegates to secure the nomination senator obamas recent agreement that the original florida and michigan results should stand reduces his pledged delegates to only 49 super delegate declarations coerced in june count for absolutely nothing only votes cast at the convention count howard dean does not choose the nominee nancy pelosi does not choose the nominee only delegates of the democratic party choose the nominee senator clintons name must be placed in for nomination her supporters must be allowed to make speeches on behalf of her candidacy there must be a true and honest roll call vote with each candidate given an equal chance to win the nomination i f democratic processes and principles are not respected if attempts are made to turn the convention into a coronation instead of choosing a nominee according to democratic rules and principles then the party will have a much bigger problem a genuine revolt of more than 18 million voters and then come november there will be a lot more than tea going over the side
3374218 i wasnt a bill clinton fan but there is no question that he attempted to
3374219 severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3374220 move ahead with the resolution despite russian veto threats and submit russia to the court of world public opinion
3374221 continue to push for a united nations security council resolution calling for an immediate end to the violence
3374222 we must charge based on facts we can prove beyond a reasonable doubt in a court of law
3374223 we do not have a quota system for charging police officers each case is evaluated on its own merits
3374224 in 2006 and 2007 we charged 36 detroit police officers with felonies and misdemeanor offenses
3374225 currently in 2008 we have charged officers with crimes these cases reflect both on and off duty misconduct the crimes range from felonies such as involuntary manslaughter criminal sexual conduct child sexual assault and domestic violence assault offenses
3374226 he was a good person who was trying to stay out of trouble although he did get into it he always talked to me and asked for guidance it was just a tragedy i dont know why the officer to emptied his whole clip into him
3374227 we cannot comment on this matter due to an ongoing investigation regarding the death of rose cobb
3374228 the investigation into my sons case was incompetent and a decision was made too quickly williams had already shot his own wife and slammed a little boy at cody high school into the wall how can you pay someone to represent the people when they allow cops to get away with shooting us pretty soon were going to start shooting back and theres going to be an all out war
3374229 under the previous two administrations there were investigations into the shootings that involved former sic detroit police officer eugene brown all of these investigations resulted in no charges being brought against him since taking office there has been no new evidence submitted to wayne county prosecutor kym worthy by any attorney or civilian
3374230 this really means a lot to me especially when you consider i started this business in the attic of my home 27 years ago
3374231 i feel extremely fortunate weve made sound business decisions that put replacements in a position to grow and continue to provide jobs to nearly 550 people at a time when other companies are struggling in todays tough economic climate
3374232 for every games we prepare for a number of situations that may or may not unfold most of those situations dont arise for these games one of the contingencies we prepared for was substandard air
3374233 i think the benefit is as much psychological as physiological theres been so much focus on air quality
3374234 for members of our delegation to know we do have contingencies in place provides peace of mind its one less thing they need to think about
3374235 their impact seems to be increasing and thats been tied to warming water temperatures giving them an ecological advantage
3374236 this will help us to understand on which types of ecosystems they might have a large impact or small impact and under which conditions they are going to be able to thrive
3374237 the question is whether this is an integral part of the physiology of the retina
3374238 once you understand the normal retina you can determine the basis of retinal disorders
3374239 this allows for a snapshot view of the relationship between fishermen and government staff and the development and implementation of marine regulations of a commercial fishery that has both economic and scientific significance
3374240 our main finding was that reward dependence is the only personality dimension correlated with opiate receptor binding and that positive correlation was restricted to the ventral striatum which is considered the key area of the human reward system and of the development of addictive behavior
3374241 this correlation means that people with high reward dependence have a high concentration of opiate receptors available in that area while people with low dependence have fewer opiate receptors
3374242 this is a novel finding and will provide a deeper understanding of the functional relation between human personality neurobiology and addictive behavior
3374243 understanding the central role of neurotransmission processes in certain brain structures for the expression of psychologically defined constructs such as personality will make a great difference in the future of medicine
3374244 is that it shows that pet technology is capable of detecting subtle biochemical differences in the brain in healthy persons which may ultimately be responsible for what we consider the individual personality this has far reaching implications not only for choosing the best individual treatments but also in discussions of an individuals free will
3374245 opiod receptor pet reveals the psycholobiologic correlates of reward processing

3374256 this number is an important reminder for physicians and patients that antibiotics can have serious side effects and should only be taken when necessary
3374257 for conditions in which antibiotics have questionable benefit such as many mild upper respiratory tract infections weighing the benefits of antibiotics with the risks of a serious adverse event will be especially important
3374258 because antibiotics are frequently used both appropriately and inappropriately if doctors would reduce the number of antibiotics they prescribe to their patients by even a small percentage we could significantly reduce the number of emergency visits for antibiotic adverse events physicians need to communicate to their patients that antibiotics are not harmless
3374259 though decades of economic research suggest men and women are equalizing in the labor market the notion that todays working women are being paid more and treated better than ever before is simply wrong
3374260 the growing equality between genders reflects the entry of the most able women to the workforce rather than better pay while there may be more women holding high power positions today they are still being paid as their counterparts were three decades ago

3374263 caregivers have a long exposure to stresses and losses from the dementia and fatigue that comes from caring for their spouses so they experience fewer positive emotions
3374264 some may have feelings of guilt about participating in activities with friends or in the community when their loved ones are no longer able to do so
3374265 specific effects of caring for a spouse with dementia differences in depressive symptoms between caregiver and non caregiver spouses
3374266 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3374267 we had encouraging results including several long term survivors in patients with stage iv cancers that had spread to distant sites
3374268 previous studies determined the maximal radiotherapy doses for single organs
3374269 but this technique has not been tested for simultaneous use on multiple organs so we designed a dose escalation trial to determine the optimal dose starting with fairly low levels and increasing the dose in later groups of patients
3374270 we have seen improved response rates with higher radiation doses without an increase in side effects yet
3374271 and several of them remain disease free one of them three years after treatment
3374272 using x rays to find solutions to earth science questions is an area that has been highly active on the srs at daresbury laboratory for some time we are very excited that the srs has contributed to answering such long standing questions about the earth in this way

3374296 no one actually knows the full scope of the abuses at guantanamo
3374297 this program was approved at the highest levels it suggests that people had simply lost their ability to distinguish right from wrong
3374298 psychologists strive to benefit those with whom they work and take care to do no harm
3374299 i was in my house and police were all in my backyard and all of a sudden they just said stay in the house next thing i know i just heard numerous bullets like over nine to 15 coming
3374300 the potential for this to get much worse is right there because this is a guy who prefers to go into places knowing theres someone home
3374301 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized
3374302 if there are any emerging hotbeds of resistance or any aggressive actions you should take steps to destroy them
3374303 we left when the shelling started we dont have food
3374304 we may say that the russian state has once again shown its face its true face
3374305 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3374306 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses
3374307 if this news that military operations are stopping is correct then it is what this country needs and we can then get on to build peace
3374308 this is a beautiful place with a wonderful people they dont deserve the suffering that has been inflicted by military operations
3374309 the scoreline may suggest it otherwise but i think it was not that easy anyway im happy with the way we played but we need to raise our game in the next round
3374310 we played solid tennis and im really happy to start on the right note

3374315 for decades newell rubbermaid has had a considerable presence in middle and east tennessee where we manufacture well known products like sharpie markers and highlighters and other office products and we are excited to be expanding our position in the community
3374316 by locating our new facility here in close proximity to other newell rubbermaid office products operations we are well positioned to maintain our sustainable competitive advantage as the worlds largest manufacturer of ink for writing instruments
3374317 it swelled up pretty good and were taking the pictures so well see
3374318 but when she comes through like she did in backstroke i think the rest of the meet will fall into place for her
3374319 the last few days i wasnt feeling as strong as i was hoping to mentally regardless i was able to get my head together and perform today
3374320 the 100 back has been progressing faster than any other female event i think for me to win gold in such a strong strong event i was really proud i think thats why i was crying like a baby on the medal stand
3374321 hes one cool customer without a doubt the best backstroker ever
3374322 but really he kind of killed us hes got the right mind for it hes always up to race and he always performs when it matters
3374323 honestly i dont know what goes on in these other guys heads i know what i have to do to get my hand on the wall
3374324 i think after we rocked the high bar we were like this is happening its happening after that moment we felt like we couldnt do anything wrong
3374325 if i was there by myself i wouldve been crapping my pants
3374326 but these guys theyre all yelling come on i could hear them stay confident swing big we dont have anything to lose
3374327 i had so much energy i felt like i couldve done another routine after that
3374328 weve said this is a family of nine and those guys were pulling for each other out there
3374329 its just been a tumultuous roller coaster ride and i couldnt be prouder of these guys this whole entire collective and collaborative effort really showed today
3374330 probably the most clutch performance ive ever seen in my whole life
3374331 but the real winners the real competitors in a sport like this are the guys that can overcome those nerves and thats what we did today
3374332 im not allowed to discuss the condition of my injuries
3374333 i think thats something that youve got to talk to coach brad childress about or the trainers
3374334 i just gave birth to 6 babies your babies i have so much to do and if you need to fulfill this new urge i suggest you go elsewhere for a few days
3374335 oh im so sorry mr mouse but i am just about to lay my eggs perhaps if you could wait a few hours i could help you

3374337 can you please help me i have a terrible problem and i just dont know what to do about it
3374338 perhaps i can help why dont you tell me about your problem and well see if we can work it out together
3374339 i just heard that mr bull is on his way home after having had a very bad day im expecting him any second and im afraid hell need a bit of my attention when he gets here if only youd have gotten here 10 minutes ago
3374340 oh mrs hippo am i glad to see you i am experiencing a problem and if you could just give me a few moments help i would be ever so grateful
3374341 hi mrs elephant i see that you dont look very busy and ive got this problem and i told mrs mouse and i told mrs chicken and i told mrs cow and i told mrs hippo but it appears that nobody can help me please mrs elephant can you help me
3374342 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganized

3374344 we left when the shelling started we dont have food
3374345 the sculpture is offensive to women we have to take it back to whoever made it and ask that it be changed
3374346 its offensive in an area where theres lots of kids and families
3374347 i dont have a problem with children seeing a depiction of a womans vagina its not done in a lewd or an erotic way
3374348 i didnt get paid for the work but the canadian embassy gave me 3 000 in cash to cover my travel costs

3374350 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3374351 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3374352 we are trying to get an assessment of what a halt means and whether it is taking place of course
3374353 president saakashvili is the duly elected president of a sovereign democratic nation and so the determination of him as president is his decision and a decision for the georgian people and not for any outside nation to make demands on whether he is the appropriate person
3374354 the escalation on the part of the russia was disproportionate to their stated intentions
3374355 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3374356 we didnt know if anyone would know who he was but they recognised him straight away
3374357 he told everyone we were the greatest band in the world we put that in his contract then he talked about who he is and why he lives in has lived under canvas in
3374358 hes doing something that most of us could never contemplate nor comprehend so we like to think he must be wired up differently we like to think his life must have always been very different to our own its not true
3374359 hes an ordinary man with a home and a family who went to a protest seven years ago realised that a tolerated demonstration was infused with impotence and refused to go home
3374360 since then the government has removed many of our rights and freedoms we no longer have the automatic right to a peaceful protest
3374361 when we picked him up on friday he was on crutches as a result of the latest attack he has taken the police to court many times and won it rarely gets in the papers often they dont even print his name he is referred to only as the peace protestor in
3374362 still he stands there day and night year on year as a symbol not only of the rights we once had but also as a symbol of hope of the freedoms we might one day claw back
3374363 i did feel for a long period that there wasnt anything new to buy
3374364 but i really like the slim fit its not so roomy not so bulky and its a lot cleaner
3374365 this is a trend that you have to buy otherwise you look outdated
3374366 suddenly a pair of cargo pants and a polo shirt doesnt look good anymore
3374367 womens wear has painted themselves in a corner by offering too many options and with everything a trend it is very easy not to buy anything
3374368 if you are keeping up with fashion people notice and it gives them more confidence
3374369 i had looked in the mirror and never was impressed i looked like a little kid who was waiting to grow into his clothes
3374370 i feel extremely confident in the way i look everyone has noticed
3374371 i would dearly love to meet someone who i can spend the rest of my life with and have that companionship with

3374389 the solution was so simple to install we had it up and running in one day with just a few minutes of end user training our clinicians and managers were able to proactively analyze data from our meditech system to research patient trends and identify diabetes patients who need closer attention to better manage their conditions

3374398 the comments of greg conti the us military academy professor in las vegas last week highlight the problems that the it security industry will face in the next few years if as the experts are predicting companies move on up the efficiency and financial benefits that cloud computing will bring them
3374399 conti pointed out that early examples of this technology such as the simple web based email services offered by google and others are difficult to secure when using standard web interfaces but isaca believes that with the right technology these problems can be solved
3374400 whilst there is no such thing as a totally secure system especially a system that is accessible across the internet our belief at isaca is that with the right technology the new generation of cloud computing system can be made as secure if not more secure than existing server based office systems
3374401 the whole web 2 0 explosion has moved from the consumer and college student world to professionals in the business world

3374404 in october obamas former pastor wright will publish a new book and hit the road to promote it an occasion that might well place the topic of obamas blackness along with his patriotism and his candor about what he heard in the pews in all those years at trinity church squarely at the center of the national debate how obama handles that moment may determine whether he becomes the next occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue
3374405 as i write this russia is waging war on my country
3374406 s storyline but lead designer jay wilson did tell me that the game will round out the story arc set up by the previous two games
3374407 we also tried to focus a little more on bringing characters back and not just from diablo ii but from diablo i
3374408 we feel like a lot of the focus is on diablo ii but diablo i started it all and has a lot of really good stuff on the gameplay side and on the character side so people can expect to see characters from diablo i more characters from diablo ii and characters from some of the books were definitely going to bring a few of them in
3374409 were not saying this is the end of the diablo universe but we are trying to bring this storyline to a close

3374414 theyre having an argument about points he says it takes a lot of points to win the game and the other teddy bear doesnt have any

3374424 our research identified a significant gap between what people say and what they do when it comes to protecting sensitive information online
3374425 while homeowners and businesses continue to embrace solar energy at a tremendous rate this growth is somehow restricted by the relatively limited number of consumers who are exposed to solar in their daily lives
3374426 i wanted to do something that was very bold and memorable and this fit the bill
3374427 its a very modest account of being married and trying to figure it all out and trying to stay connected with this person that youve vowed to love and cherish until death do you part
3374428 we eliminated photographs of old matriarchs and children we removed childrens books and toys from the room we added candles and incense to the room and covered the bed with an east indian bedspread we also draped a tapestry over the television
3374429 along those lines we didnt have sex with bad breath
3374430 we tried to look good for each other we treated our nightly engagements as if we were dating again we would shower annie would wear nice lingerie and lipstick i would not wear my ratty old sweatpants but instead wear a nice robe or pyjamas
3374431 we really felt these 101 days were special we treated it as an adventure
3374432 we didnt spend much money but we did do more than we would have normally but we wanted to really treat these 101 days with great respect and to make them memorable for the rest of our lives
3374433 i was one of those spouses who was running around like a chicken with their heads cut off and at the end of the day turning to my husband and saying ugh
3374434 i knew that that was one thing that i had let fall off the list of important things so to speak
3374435 and i would probably tell you that before the year of the gift you know maybe a couple of times a month at most
3374436 i think he was a little suspicious at such an over the top idea
3374437 i think he was worried that perhaps i couldnt follow through or perhaps on one level he wondered if he could
3374438 so we would sit down and say ive got book club on monday night youve got a sales meeting on tuesday night so lets figure out whether morning is going to work for us or maybe right when you get home from work and things like that
3374439 nobody needs to do it for 101 consecutive days but committing to a period of time a month 10 days a week a long weekend is extremely important for couples that arent doing it as much as they would like
3374440 sex is what keeps us from being just pals its powerful its important and when it declines it harms relationships
3374441 i think i realised what an extraordinarily common experience this is negotiating intimacy in a committed marriage
3374442 it doesnt matter whether you live in the youre figuring it out
3374443 annie discovered the pleasures of lube and she still marvels over the stuff
3374444 towards the end of it i thought holy cow what have i done
3374445 various drugs stopped everything from spinning but that night after being incredibly sick all day i did it
3374446 it was one of the quickest of the quickies but i managed
3374447 we did have sex on the 101st day and i felt grateful that we had finished i was ready to rest though
3374448 he knew that if he hit tskhinvali south ossetias capital the russians would hit georgia now they are bombing us into oblivion
3374449 we need to know whether we are still under moscows rule or whether we are protected by the west

3374454 the name menomena comes from an italian soft porn movie but its also greek for what remains so there are a few different layers behind it
3374455 i get a little disappointed when journalists spoil the surprise a fun thing about the band is we want people to hear us and then a year later see the muppets on tv and realize how we got our name the muppets stole the name from porn and were stealing it back
3374456 theres always a negotiation between what people are eager to hear and the music musicians are eager to make and how those two get connected
3374457 that means theres now a strange homogenization and complication when it comes to music theres no clear channel that controls how music is distributed mainstream radio does try they have complicated algorithms that determine an average grade and a threshold percentage chance of a song being a radio hit there are pressures from when people listen to music in short increments that forces music to be dumbed down
3374458 most people are looking for music that is a kind of language with new ways of communicating new words and phrases and rhythms
3374459 bands like animal collective and califone are pushing and tugging on the perceived notions of what makes a song a song then there are bands like arcade fire who can somehow push deep into our music sensibility with something that resonates and is increasingly enjoyable on subsequent listens weve all heard music that we liked at first and then it becomes stale and we feel cheated like the music is a fraud the lyrics are pointless there is no redeeming value or maybe they dont even write their own songs the music i am most enamored with maintains an innocence despite the talents of the musician
3374460 no one else is going to do it for you you have to make your own context the best artists the music i love is always done by people who are totally committed to the craft of music not just getting attention they are very inventive in the process they use and the technology they use i like how the guy in tool makes his own guitar pedals or that tori amos uses these unique pianos and harpsichords in recording sound garden for a majority of their songs use alternate tunings they experimented with new sounds and new ways of making sounds
3374461 we have for the most part avoided the neurotic curse of measuring how this microphone sounds in a certain cabinet or which way it is pointing exactly or that we just cant record unless we get this new piece of gear some people get hung up on the idea that they cant record the great american record unless they have this 10 000 microphone or a certain pre amp theres an entire industry that makes a living convincing people that they dont have the gear they need but once you get a basic recording setup it is not that complicated we recorded a majority of our first record using the same microphone and borrowed a couple of others for other recordings
3374462 the core name is and will be our flagship pc processor brand going forward

3374466 we dont know if the victim is going to pursue the charges anytime there is a domestic allegation the victim is offered an emergency protection order basically a restraining order she declined it she also declined medical treatment
3374467 the victim did have visible injuries and we also believe alcohol was involved that will be part of the investigation

3374469 oil demand data are coming in weaker on an underlying trend basis

3374491 its been so easy for people to get into debt now the economic climate has changed and panic is setting in
3374492 i dont really know where my money goes it would probably be good if i sat down and worked that out
3374493 ive no idea what im spending this on although its more than likely coffee thats e3 25 every morning by 20 working mornings a month which comes to 65 how have i been spending 65 a month on coffee
3374494 shes in a good place in that things havent gotten totally out of control
3374495 the first thing she needs to do is sit down and work out an accurate budget of her non discretionary payments that means no luxuries theres no allowance in her budget for car tax car service medical bills that sort of thing she needs to put all of those things in there
3374496 as for the credit card i suggest she changes supplier and moves to someone who will give her interest free credit
3374497 if she gets made redundant her first port of call must be to her mortgage supplier
3374498 i thought id have more money as i got older but now im going to have less

3374506 in fact cmt has been jockeying for position in order to impose on bel air s
3374507 more importantly what results from cmts proposal for a joint venture and the visit of cmts project manager is that cmt in fact has absolutely no separate and independent project for the development of bel air for which there were no technical workings on the part of cmt or any presentation which had been made to the multisectorial ministries
3374508 bel air s e verily believes that no application whatsoever was made by cmt for any hotel development to the ministry of tourism and no hotel project was presented by cmt neither to the ministry of the environment nor the ministry of finance
3374509 the botched decision of the minister taken in a time frame of a mere month without any site visit and or other ministry or authority being involved is unreasonable and irrational
3374510 at the relevant time and prior to the decision taken cmt did not have any detailed or technical plan for the sites had absolutely no expertise whatsoever in the hotel and land development had no idea whatsoever of the topography of the lands in question and had no partner with any expertise in such land development
3374511 the governments decision must have been taken on the understanding that there was a purported joint venture between cmt and bel air s e in respect of bel air s e s project in line with what cmt itself wrote on the 23rd june 2008 three days after the issue of the reservation letter the purported cmt project was in truth and in fact a purported joint venture between cmt and bel air s e bel air s e is given to understand and verily believes that this purported joint venture is what was presented to government and was the reason why the letter of reservation was issued to cmt
3374512 there was no and has never been any separate and independent cmt stand alone project
3374513 the minister did not inform parliament that the two leases on which cmt is purportedly to build two hotels are not contiguous but separated by campement site leases granted to bel air s e the minister also failed to properly draw the attention of parliament on the access to the site which brings about a contemplated compulsory acquisition of bel air s e s lands
3374514 the whole of benar s neighbouring bel air is available this would result in four hotel projects the two of bel air s e and two of the cmt instead of only two of cmt
3374515 the lease of l le aux b nitiers had been terminated by the former minister of lands under the former government and allocated to a hotel project feeling that this decision constituted a blatant injustice to the previous occupiers of the site the incoming government cancelled the decision of the outgoing government and restored the original lease of l le aux b nitiers to its beneficiairies bel air s e avers that what could be labeled as an injustice for l le aux b nitiers can equally be an injustice to bel air s e
3374516 the minister dulull and or the permanent secretary cannot request bel air s e to go through the ordeal it has been requested to over years and yet treat differently cmt
3374517 in unverified and wrong assumptions that there was an agreement between the cmt and bel air s e
3374518 we have been working on this project for over three years now and although we have had many meetings with government ministries including the ministry of lands as well as the boi we still have not received a single permit
3374519 the whole pas g om triques had been planted by my family since 1968 and the cachet would be kept and enhanced
3374520 at ministry and department level i e deputy prime minister minister of tourism minister of housing and lands adviser to the prime minister kailash ruhee and board of investment
3374521 there had never been any agreement between bel air s e and cmt
3374522 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging economic environment

3374563 we are not actually cloaking anything i dont think we have to worry about invisible people walking around any time soon to be honest we are just at the beginning of doing anything like that
3374564 in naturally occurring material the index of refraction a measure of how light bends in a medium is positive when you see a fish in the water the fish will appear to be in front of the position it really is or if you put a stick in the water the stick seems to bend away from you
3374565 instead of the fish appearing to be slightly ahead of where it is in the water it would actually appear to be above the waters surface its kind of weird
3374566 what we have done is taken that material and made it much thicker we call it a fishnet
3374567 however cloaking may be something that this material could be used for in the future youd have to wrap whatever you wanted to cloak in the material it would just send light around by sending light around the object that is to be cloaked you dont see it
3374568 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3374569 with global warming and a world thats running out of oil the last thing governments should do is add taxes on something that uses no oil and produces no carbon a digital download is the greenest way to buy music movies and software since it requires no driving to the store no delivery vans and no plastics or packaging

3374587 da ich den ersten stint gefahren bin wollte ich keine fehler machen und eine pace finden die es uns erm glichte einige positionen nach vorn zu gelangen genau das ist passiert und dank einem blitzschnellen fahrerwechsel kamen wir am ende auf den sechsten platz
3374588 diese aufregende erfahrung habe ich sehr genossen vor allem nach dem desaster von 2006
3374589 damals konnte ich nicht einmal fahren weil der wagen schon fr h aus dem rennen ausgeschieden war

3374591 ich mag asphalt rallyes auch wenn deutschland alles andere als ein typischer asphalt lauf ist
3374592 man kann es ein bisschen mit monte carlo vergleichen wo die bedingungen auch st ndig wechseln und man nie wei was das wetter macht ich wei nicht genau warum aber solche bedingungen scheinen mir zu liegen obwohl es viele schnelle abschnitte gibt kommt es bei dieser rallye nicht nur auf die maximale power an vielmehr braucht man ein auto das in allen bereichen gut ist und vor allem sollte man sich aus jedem rger heraushalten wenn wir probleme vermeiden k nnen k nnte es eine gute rallye f r uns werden
3374593 ich kenne die stra en nicht so gut aber wir haben in diesem jahr schon oft genug gesehen dass wir auch bei f r uns neuen rallyes in die punkte fahren k nnen wenn wir keine probleme bekommen mein ziel ist die rallye zu beenden und damit mehr erfahrung auf asphalt zu sammeln ich hoffe aber auch auf punkte
3374594 und wir kommen dorthin nach sieben monaten asphalt abstinenz es ist auch das erste mal dass wir mit dem sx4 wrc in deutschland fahren deshalb werden wir die rallye nutzen um am feintuning zu arbeiten es gibt dort viel zu lernen es war aber auch immer schon ein lauf bei dem man ein gutes ergebnis holen kann wenn man sich aus allem rger heraush lt ich rate den fahrern keine unn tigen risiken einzugehen gleichzeitig wird das team daran arbeiten die performance und die zuverl ssigkeit des sx4 wrc zu steigern

3374597 nothing seems simpler than a load of fresh laundry hung on a clothesline to dry unless you live in roswell where a public view of socks and shirtsleeves snapping in the breeze may spell trouble as part of an effort to strengthen code enforcement rules the city last week started requiring its residents to hide clotheslines behind houses the city also lowered the acceptable height of weeds and grass from 18 inches to 10 inches and reduced the time homeowners have to tidy their properties from 10 to three days while other local governments in metro atlanta dont admit to regulating clotheslines it isnt uncommon to find such bans in neighborhood association covenants

3374619 an immature chipset solution from infineon technologies ag may be at the root of reported connection problems with apple inc s 3g iphone nomura analyst richard windsor said in a note to clients tuesday
3374620 he said some iphone users are having trouble getting a 3g connection and hanging on to it hiccups reportedly include a high incidence of dropped calls switching onto the slower edge network while the device is stationary and loss of reception while in good coverage
3374621 windsor writes that the problem isn t likely to be solved with firmware updates which means apple could have to replace the chips so users get the performance they were promised
3374622 stephen yarbrough has a love hate relationship with his new apple iphone 3g he calls it the best gadget hes ever had but also the worst mobile phone
3374623 yarbroughs complaints stem from spotty phone reception owing to the phones 3g wireless technology he said that when the phone is set to ride on the faster 3g network the signal often fluctuates and drops calls even though it should be able to revert to a slower wireless technology called edge
3374624 he has taken to turning off his phones 3g connection when making phone calls and relying on the edge technology to maintain his conversations yarbrough upgraded his phones software last week but the problems continued he said
3374625 mark siegel an at amp t spokesman said apple and at amp t are working to ensure that users have a great experience with the iphone 3g which he said has not been a source of tremendous complaints
3374626 he said that while customer concerns are being investigated its hard to know if they are widespread or the product of individual circumstances
3374627 widespread complaints about the iphone 3gs reception have spread across the internet in the month since apple and at amp t released the successor to the original iphone the companies insist that nothing is wrong but the complaints have been mounting through e mails water cooler discussions and message boards on apples own web site iphone 3g users are having trouble connecting and staying connected to the 3g networks in their areas
3374628 repeated attempts over the past week to get apple and at amp t to even acknowledge the uproar if not the issues specifically proved pointless
3374629 its always difficult to determine the scope of an issue posted on internet message boards whether or not a loud minority is blowing up a relatively minor problem into something more
3374630 network coverage isnt the only possible cause of all these problems
3374631 users of other mobile phones on at amp ts 3g network are not reporting the same kinds of issues and iphone 3g users in the u k and australia among other places are reporting similar issues
3374632 its possible that a software problem is responsible for some of the issues if true that would actually be good news for iphone 3g owners since apple would be able to correct the issue in a subsequent update
3374633 but at this stage while its easy to theorize its almost impossible to know for sure what might be causing the problems
3374634 3g will often show a lower connection but work as well
3374635 weve discovered that we can deliver the product at a fraction of what our original estimates were

3374645 apple is likely to announce a redesigned ipod touch and slimmer macbooks at an event in september analysts said on monday
3374646 the new macbooks will be slimmer might have exteriors made of aluminum instead of plastic and could also have a newly designed keyboards said mike olson an analyst at piper jaffray amp co
3374647 the design of the ipod touch will be tweaked to resemble apples new iphone 3g at the same price the storage capacity of the ipod touch could increase or the same capacity could be offered at a lower price olson said
3374648 apple has held a special event in september to launch new ipods for the last three years piper jaffray analyst gene munster wrote in a report this year apple might announce increased capacity of ipods including the shuffle and nano brands but the products wont be redesigned munster wrote

3374654 this is how bad things have gotten for microsoft corp the software behemoth has a virtual monopoly in computer operating systems and yet it still can t get people to buy the latest version of its flagship product windows
3374655 the company knows it has a problem and it has decided to address it directly with an ad campaign arguing that the product isn t as bad as people think it is to their detriment they ve fumbled that too
3374656 a new campaign called the mojave experiment shows a series of regular users who seem to like windows vista a lot as long as they don t think it s windows vista
3374657 we don t actually see much footage of people trying windows vista so we don t know how much they actually did themselves versus how much they were shown by an experienced marketer
3374658 we also don t know whether the subjects were able to directly address the issues users have complained about such as sluggishness with older or cheaper computers or incompatibility with existing products
3374659 plus we don t know whether the people they show are a representative sample of the public
3374660 microsoft takes a page from movie promoters and pulls a one liner from a long review of vista

3374704 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3374715 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3374716 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3374717 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3374982 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from

3374995 eu is committed to working together with partner countries in equal partnership to make aid better and more effective in order to enhance democratic ownership of partner countries of their own development agenda and to increase development effectiveness the eu will facilitate processses for more country led aid effectiveness and prioritise action building upon the list of issues identified by partner countries
3374996 the eu believes that conditions should be based on development goals and performance targets drawn from partner countries own plans strategies and policies and confirmed in mutual agreements between partner countries and donors conditions should be designed in a transparent manner so as to make them more effective at more improving predictability allow for a maximum degree of partner countries policy options and promote sustainable development results there is a need to move away from unilaterally imposed policy conditions towards mutually agreed commitments formulated in terms of performance measures and outcomes this will also enable the dialogue between partner countries and donors to become more focussed on key development issues and results rather than indivicual donor conditionalities

3374998 when it comes to the challenges of ownership i think that decentralization of ec aid is an important factor decentralization to the delegations so that the dialogue can take place on a level where the partnership is taking place and that goes for all the member states but certainly for the governments and the civil society and that is something for what we have to work stronger for the decentralization of the delegations

3375000 its sad that the bishop wont give a straight answer and agree to help
3375001 if rocker is telling the truth conlon can help police prosecutors and children by getting her back home so that a dangerous predator can be jailed if rocker is lying conlon can help an innocent priest clear his name
3375002 conlon is doing precisely what americas bishops have almost always done with child sex cases the bare minimum
3375003 helping law enforcement get information about alleged crimes isnt taking sides its our civic duty
3375004 this is just a smokescreen by conlon to excuse his do nothing posture
3375005 beth will be here to testify though because some compassionate survivors of clergy abuse across the country are combining their efforts to loan her money for her ticket
3375006 well do whatever it takes to help law enforcement move forward
3375007 its just terribly disappointing that conlon apparently doesnt share our desire and the prosecutors need to get to the truth here
3375008 hundreds of ohio survivors of clergy abuse cant ever have their day in court because of the states archaic predator friendly statute of limitations
3375009 thank heavens beth has come forward quickly enough to file criminal charges its just sad shes getting no support in this from church officials
3375010 as a local lad its fantastic to see initiatives such as npower urban cricket giving youngsters the chance to get out there and play the game
3375011 its going to make a real difference to the local community and will hopefully produce more first class cricketers from the birmingham area
3375012 the npower urban cricket facilities are a great way of developing a legacy for the game and allowing children in the area to practice their skills
3375013 the npower urban cricket arena at highgate park is a real benefit to the city
3375014 it adds to the local facilities we already have and will help young people lead more active lifestyles urban cricket has been rolled out into other areas of the uk with great success and we are very fortunate to have it here in birmingham too
3375015 its always hot in darwin the humidity though is nothing like it is here and we expect bouncy pitches

3375046 isilon clustered storage delivered in full enabling us to deliver the highest quality product and meet our deadline without worrying about administrating the system or managing complex capacity additions
3375047 as audiences continue to demand more realism and visual impact from motion pictures leading edge visual effects are a critical component in enabling hollywood studios to meet this demand with each new release
3375048 the orphanages portfolio speaks for itself while their use of isilon clustered storage sets the template for post production companies looking to maximize the productivity of their operations in delivering the next generation of visual effects

3375069 and while the company does business in 26 countries its contracts in china alone could keep foster wheeler busy for several years
3375070 foster wheeler operates in two segments the global engineering and construction group designs and builds energy processing facilities worldwide
3375071 the company has a dod contract to develop a gasification unit that will be used in 21 coal fired electric plants the systems being produced by foster wheeler emit no airborne pollutants and are cost effective i think the technology has enormous potential
3375072 so do the chinese as you may know china produces almost all its electricity with coal the only fossil fuel it has in abundance most chinese coal fired plants are major polluters and must be cleaned up foster wheeler is the leading contender for the contracts
3375073 the company s coal technology also produces flammable gasses that can be used in other types of power generating equipment including fuel cells and gas turbines
3375074 in addition the gaseous coal is a good feedstock for various industrial chemicals the char waste that is left over after the process is complete can be burned in high pressure steam turbine electric plants
3375075 of course other energy contractors also have coal gasification technology the process dates to the 1930s however foster wheelers synfuel process operates at much lower temperatures than competing methods this reduces the need for expensive gas exchangers and cleanup systems
3375076 they are also easier to scale up or down for different sized plants it s not surprising that the chinese decided the foster wheeler system is the best fit for them
3375077 foster wheeler s second business is the global power group that constructs electric plants throughout the world china s contracts alone could keep foster wheeler busy for several years
3375078 foster wheeler also excels in using waste energy from industrial operations to generate power an area where it competes with ormat technologies in addition the company uses many kinds of industrial solids as fuel in power plants
3375079 with today s high energy costs the company s efficient green processes are in great demand foster wheeler has an excellent track record but its stock is down sharply with oil prices however energy will surely recover and go on to new highs
3375080 the july jump in the federal minimum wage rate appears to have had the predicted impact on teen employment the higher required rate enticed more teens into the job market to search for a smaller number of jobs on offer
3375081 the operations of many energy partnerships have nothing to do with the price of crude and natural gas they only need to have demand
3375082 midstream partnerships those that operate pipelines or storage and processing facilities segments as well as those that invest in these segments are among the most stable distribution payers
3375083 and more importantly right now they re among the most stable investments in what s become a treacherous stock market
3375084 whether the broad energy market is up or down these partnerships continue to be all around successes kinder morgan energy partners and kinder morgan management are foundation holdings in our portfolio
3375085 the big runs up and now the big slides in both crude and natural gas haven t meant much to either partnership and while the stock prices have inched higher each has been paying out nice pieces of their respective profits
3375086 kinder morgan energy is currently yielding more than 7 and its payout is rising by more than 8 on an average annual basis
3375087 this makes it a particularly desirable investment for those who want to avoid dealing with k 1 forms and those seeking assets for qualified investment accounts such as iras

3375125 one possibility being considered is the cat has been killed by those responsible for the murders
3375126 this put about 40 million board feet on the ground everything from large trees to small trees
3375127 it could have been about an acre fire but they couldnt get in there because of the trees across the roads and in the fire area
3375128 they couldnt get hand crews in there we had to bring two cats bulldozers in it took five hours to get a cat line around it normally it would have taken about 45 minutes

3375142 the notion of stolen elections is something we assign to third world countries but not this beacon of freedom and democracy that we like to view ourselves as

3375146 almost any kind of test can be run under the harness so i do not think there is any limitation that would stop you from doing what you want what tends to make the difference is how much built in support the harness and frameworks provide to you to decrease the amount of code you need to write the harness can help decrease the work required for you to configure gather results and generate reports the details depend on how complex your scenarios are but jt harness would be able to bring them all together under a single user interface

3375156 the changes that information technology brought to our societies promoted radical advances in educational environments changing teachers instructional roles in the classroom it is a fact that our younger generations have embraced this technology while for some educators it is seen as a threat to their role acquiring technology skills and developing new teaching strategies for integrating technology into educational institutions would change the dynamics of the classes turning instant messaging into a collaborative tool for both students and faculty

3375488 the economy continues to worsen and we must make the painful choice to reduce expenses further
3375489 we may limit the number of voluntary applications we accept given business needs or to ensure that no one area of the operation is unfairly impacted
3375490 we will evaluate the number of employees leaving under the voluntary program how work will be streamlined reallocated and consolidated and what additional expense reductions may still be necessary then we will determine if additional staff reductions must be made through an involuntary severance program

3375494 if you had to pick one thing to make people healthier as they age it would be aerobic exercise
3375495 the health benefits of exercise are greater than we thought
3375496 we know that deaths come one to a customer eventually we will have a 100 percent mortality rate in both groups
3375497 when we first began there was skepticism about our ideas
3375498 wir mussten uns entscheiden es war fair gegen ber lin miaoke und gegen ber yang peiyi
3375499 wir kombinierten die perfekte stimme mit der perfekten auff hrung
3375500 jetzt wei jeder dass sie eine betr gerin ist wen k mmert es da noch dass sie s ist
3375501 sie spielt sich nicht gerne in den vordergrund sie ist unbek mmert
3375502 schatzi wir haben sie und dieses mal nimmt sie uns keiner weg
3375503 es ist eine gute genugtuung das uns wieder zu holen was man uns weggenommen hat jetzt haben wir ihnen das gezeigt
3375504 das war berzeugend sie haben lange von der revanche f r athen getr umt das war sie respekt

3375508 well if you are gonna stand there chatting grab a towel and start drying
3375509 due primarily to the continuing negative effects of the economy on our advertising revenues and those of other publishing companies and the difference between our stock price following the spin off of scripps networks interactive to shareholders and the per share carrying value of our remaining net assets we determined that indications of impairment existed as of june 30 2008
3375510 the culture at the vancouver sun is incredibly poisonous and it extends right through the newsroom
3375511 there are very few reporters who are particularly happy or proud of the vancouver sun as a newspaper
3375512 if the editor in chief found out i talked id be finished
3375513 if there was another game in town itd be different but theres nothing else in this city theres nowhere else to go
3375514 the story of the sun should be presented as a cautionary tale to the rest of the world
3375515 if you want to see the future of media just look at vancouver where you have the tightest control of media in the free world if you allow cross media ownership like the federal communications commission in the united states has been considering this is how it could end up
3375516 the vancouver sun has a policy of avoiding the use of unnamed sources
3375517 we consider it a violation of journalistic ethics to permit people to criticize others while remaining anonymous i do not care to participate in interviews with publications whose ethical standards i do not share
3375518 i know journalism is a business but i think its just a question of how you strike the balance between the quality of the product and the bottom line my concern is that when you have these conglomerate ownerships that not only own several newspapers but radio television internet then i think by definition the commitment to any one of those properties is decreased
3375519 i can say to our critics and to the bleeding hearts of the journalist community that its the end of the world as they know it and i feel fine
3375520 people do their jobs they roll their eyeballs and a lot of them at quitting time stop thinking about it
3375521 and it makes you wonder about the future there are all sorts of new pressures going on in todays media and most of us dont have confidence that the aspers have the business acumen to deal with these pressures in an effective way
3375522 all transactions that increase concentration of ownership in the mass media are undesirable and contrary to the public interest unless otherwise shown
3375523 freedom of the press is not a property right of owners
3375524 the concentration of ownership has reached levels that few other countries would consider acceptable
3375525 convergence has become an essential business strategy in order to stay competitive

3375553 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3375554 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as climate change
3375555 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3375556 schumer would have known that his charges were false if he had taken a little time to check his facts before rushing into print

3375579 icleis partnership with the carbon disclosure project underscores how crucial standards quantification methods and voluntary reporting are to local climate action

3375587 everyones hearing that this is a buyers market and while thats true buyers need to know the inside scoop on working with builders to get the kind of home they want
3375588 builders and homebuyers form a team with the same objectives no matter what the market and by working together much can be accomplished to the satisfaction of everyone
3375589 think about location quality of neighborhood current design comparable value lot size and home features that are important to you and your family
3375590 buying a home is perhaps the largest investment youll make in your lifetime and you should give it thoughtful consideration if you must have an open floor plan or a master suite with a separate sitting area dont settle for anything less
3375591 we begin with elaborately detailed entrances to our neighborhoods and take that detail to the home inside and out
3375592 new homebuyers should be impressed by their neighborhoods entrance and feel good about their home being a part of a masterfully planned neighborhood our homebuyers wanting to build have the opportunity to work one on one with our decorator to make the many choices that go into building your own home it is an exciting time for most homebuyers and we like to help make it a great experience by making it easy for them
3375593 in the current market homebuyers will find that homes may be selling for less than they were valued one year ago but the quality of our homes remains top notch
3375594 today even more special features are being added to our homes to attract the buyers we pride ourselves on our mark of excellence in every home and that will never change we are offering brand new neighborhoods with all of the homes being investments that will offer faster future value
3375595 disinformation disseminated by an organization so as to present an environmentally responsible public image
3375596 greenwash is the gap between what companies say they will do to make their business sustainable and what they actually deliver in practice there is currently a grey area where genuinely positive intentions prove to be more difficult to deliver than originally envisioned but it is very dangerous for anyone to use this excuse on a regular basis in the long run the most respected and valued brands will be those that have a deep philosophical commitment to sustainability and a track record of solid delivery and innovation
3375597 greenwash is a pejorative term that some environmentalists and critics use to describe the activity of brands and corporations that portray a positive public image of putatively environmentally unsound practices greenwashing can take many guises ranging from lies of omission to misleading labelling systems from empty mission statements and voluntary codes of conduct to sustainability reports that offer only partial disclosure and transparency right through to the arbitrary sponsorship of good causes and events its a whitewash of the green variety a sham a hoax a scandal that dazzles consumers with the blinding beauty that is green the holy grail of sustainability that warm feeling you get when you do something good
3375598 when it comes to worries about greenwash the best option is to trust your gut many of us are far more media savvy than we know and have good antenna for lies and hypocrisy the use of numbers facts and statistics can be a good sign the company lawyers probably checked them before the advertisers were allowed to use them but general green feel good messages should raise more alarm bells if youre making a major purchase like a car research the facts behind the spin there are some real changes happening in businesses and those that are going green deserve our support and those that are riding on their coattails without substance to their claims well they deserve what they get too
3375599 must not misrepresent or overstate their claims to being eco friendly
3375600 if i knew what a hallucination was i would know what reality was
3375601 the soul and substance of what customarily ranks as patriotism is moral cowardice and always has been

3375604 religion is based i think primarily and mainly upon fear it is partly the terror of the unknown and partly as i have said the wish to feel that you have a kind of elder brother who will stand by you in all your troubles and disputes a good world needs knowledge kindliness and courage it does not need a regretful hankering after the past or a fettering of the free intelligence by the words uttered long ago by ignorant men

3375650 on the 4th august 2001 my 15 year old nephew timothy winkler also took his own life because of constant bullying whilst also attending kadina high school at lismore
3375651 how many more young lives and families will be destroyed before this bullying is addressed and eradicated
3375652 when someone takes their own life the pain and suffering does not stop with the death of that person
3375653 its the loved ones left behind who suffer through no fault of their own
3375654 they suffer guilt complexes like why didnt i see it coming where did i fail but the truth is it is not their fault
3375655 my brother timothys father battled with this along with the rest of the family until it became too much for him on 22 4 2003 when he took his own life to stop his own pain and suffering
3375656 surely the objective is to stamp out bullying and in the process save lives
3375657 we recommend that the pcgg terminate immediately the services of the two remaining chief of staff of comm abcede since the tasks that they were doing as pcgg ee personnel can be done by the commissioners special legal counsel and the three 3 executive assistants

3375659 they are not plantilla items hence they are not covered by csc law and rules governing regular positions or positions in the career service their designation and assignment of duties are purely internal in the office of commissioner abcede regarding the observation on compensation suffice it to state that they are also not covered by the rules on compensation

3375661 you dont have to change your entire website overnight its about making ongoing changes letting the user know you are aware of accessibility and doing something about it
3375662 irish businesses and government organisations are doing better than they used to etenders website it is very rare to see one that does not specify accessibility and to the correct level which is more important
3375663 there is an improvement in the level of knowledge that guidelines for accessibility exist but not the same amount of improvement in the actual level of change
3375664 somebody once said that google is the webs most important blind man if we make content accessible to people with disabilities whereby a complete text alternative is made available in the background then the search engine can read it and rank it accordingly
3375665 when a blind person enters a supermarket for the first time they have no way of knowing what kind of chocolate biscuits for example are on the shelf
3375666 but when they enter a website for the first time there is the opportunity to have this information at their fingertips
3375667 i know how we can improve our companys web site seo and usability by following some simple best practice guidelines

3375781 neuroscientists are making great leaps forward in understanding how the brain works unfortunately when neuroscientific claims jump to the classroom the facts often get lost and the science misapplied our cognitive scientist explores a few such misapplications and explains why neuroscience is not likely to provide answers to teachers in the near future
3375782 how did the myth of brain based pedagogy become so pervasive in educational discussions how did policy makers educators and the public become so misinformed brain science which is still refining methods to analyze early brain development is not ready to relate neuronal processes to classroom outcomes
3375783 actual testing of brain based theories in classrooms is almost non existent
3375784 why is this a symbol of whats wrong with education what is not wrong is wanting to help all students learn and trying to find methods to do so that are supported by research what is wrong is that once again
3375785 the trouble is that some educators are extrapolating piecemeal from certain findings and creating curriculum specifications without actual research to back up their claims they are hitting the streets with brain based learning kits and workshops
3375786 in fact actual testing of brain based theories in classrooms is almost non existent
3375787 d c school superintendent paul l vance often says he plans to revamp early childhood education with the latest brain research the only problem top brain researchers say it cant be done you cant go from neuroscience to the classroom because we dont know enough neuroscience said kurt w fischer director of the mind brain and education program at harvard universitys graduate school of education there really is no research that links learning strategies or classroom methods to changes in brain structure said john t bruer president of the mcdonnell foundation in st louis educators are making a very big mistake by wasting their time on brain based curricula that hasnt stopped a growing number of educators from believing that the world of education can be reborn via neuroscience and by buying what sam wineburg professor at the college of education at the university of washington in seattle calls snake oil companies sell learning kits based on the latest brain research and professional development consultants peddle the concept to teachers
3375788 brain science fascinates teachers and educators just like it fascinates all of us
3375789 neuroscientists often they are puzzled by the neuroscientific results educators choose to cite by the interpretations educators give those results and by the conclusions educators draw from them
3375790 this article examines a set of claims that i will call the neuroscience and education argument the negative conclusion is that the argument fails the argument fails because its advocates are trying to build a bridge too far
3375791 there has always been a simmering interest in brain research among educators
3375792 these issues contain a variety of articles articles by advocates of brain based curricula articles by educational futurists articles by cognitive not brain scientists in fact it is rare to find an article written by a neuroscientist in the educational literature of these articles those citing cognitive research provide the most useful advice to educators educators should be aware that cognitive science the behavioral science of the mind is not the same as neuroscience the biological science of the brain most other claims found in the emerging brain and education literatures are vague outdate metaphorical or based on misconceptions
3375793 some have asserted that brain research supports playing mozart to babies increasing funding for early childhood programs using particular teaching strategies or curricula or timing certain learning experiences around windows of opportunity when the brain is most receptive to them but theres disagreement over what the research implies about teaching learning and public policy i see a lot of dramatic kinds of marketing because of brain research says carl gabbard professor of motor development at texas a amp m university and past president of the national association of sport and physical education who is skeptical of such extreme claims
3375794 in studies of many animal species the brain shows signs of exerting less effort as individuals learn to perform simple tasks or to recognize relationships between repeatedly presented items neural activity slackened in both pathways on later trials as individuals demonstrated better knowledge pathways increasingly pool their efforts during learning trials
3375795 but mel levines ideas have also attracted some criticism although many parents and teachers swear by his methods the stories are anecdotal unconfirmed by peer review critics also fault levines books for not having footnotes or appendices where serious research could be discussed
3375796 how did levine come to his particular theory of the mind since
3375797 the devil is in the details however and beyond the big picture view levines theory has numerous oddities that would make people knowledgeable about the mind or about learning disabilities uncomfortable although he claims to read the research literature avidly these oddities seem to stem from a neglect of the literature it is surprising indeed that government officials are investing money in levines program schools attuned given the lack of data on its effectiveness its weak theoretical basis and its open conflict with what is known about the mind and how children learn
3375798 and now the mod metaphor is right brain versus left brain except that it is the worst of mixed metaphors the kind that mixes up metaphor with reality being a neurophysiologist i suppose i ought to feel that progress has been made in no other age could it have taken a mere twenty years to shift from a predominantly religious metaphor to a semi scientific one but the neurophysiologists and neuropsychologists who specialize in the human cerebral cortex are starting to view the left righters with something of the wariness which the astronomers reserve for astrology

3375800 teachers are lapping this up like you would not believe
3375801 teachers call it the reform du jour and for many its the biggest challenge at the start of any school year
3375802 the key to fad proofing your school is to look for things that work and avoid those that dont here are suggestions from some top superintendents and teachers excerpt first three points remember that the most entertaining consultant does not always have the best ideas textbook publishers or consultants rarely provide data or evidence that their materials or in service programs are effective insist on it take a hard look at the research base behind a proposal whats the evidence that students will learn more under the new program than under the program it is replacing what is the experimental design of the study and how strong is the evidence
3375803 ok so this brain based stuff isnt what its cracked up to be but its kind of a good exercise i guess and what harm does it do
3375804 another troubling trend which seems to be emergent is a great fascination with whats called
3375805 imagine that you have to choose an in service training session for your bus mechanics
3375806 there isnt that much new under the sun even in this modern era of great technological advances the odds of a newly minted edd coming up with a pedagogical method that is superior to all that has been done in the past five millennia are slim the odds that such a revolutionary method could be explained to teachers in two or three hours are virtually none

3375813 if everyone boiled only the water they needed to make a cup of tea instead of filling the kettle every time we could save enough electricity in a year to power the uks street lights for nearly 7 months this is the equivalent of the electricity used by 300 000 households for a year or output of a typical power station for nearly 5 months

3375815 there is no doubt that economic and environmental factors are significantly changing which vehicles individuals buy and even more interestingly the types of vehicles they choose to purchase again

3375817 he shall not be released from prison till the rest of his life
3375818 remission is allowed to life convicts in the most mechanical manner without any sociological or psychiatric appraisal of the convict and without any proper assessment as to the effect of the early release of a particular convict on the society
3375819 the unsound way in which remission is actually allowed in cases of life imprisonment make out a very strong case to make a special category for the very few cases where the death penalty might be substituted by the punishment of imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term in excess of fourteen years and to put that category beyond the application of remission

3375839 repossession is the last resort and every possible alternative should be investigated first
3375840 such a dramatic increase in repossessions suggests that some lenders are approaching the problem too rigidly and that staff that are inexperienced in handling an increasing arrears portfolio are seeing repossession as the only solution
3375841 our advice would be to seek expert arrears handling support and as and when necessary look to employ lawyers who have no vested interest in taking possession of a property

3375857 in the last two years 19 bills have been introduced in state legislatures in the us none of them have yet passed what it shows is that there is significant popular demand for a solution to junk mail and enough so that some politicians felt that they had a stable foundation on which to introduce legislation but there is also signficant opposition and well financed opposition to a do not mail registry
3375858 the mhra will not hesitate to take action against those who undermine public health there is considerable risk to the public from obtaining medicines through unregulated websites a medicine bought in this way has no guarantee of safety quality or effectiveness it could be counterfeit it may not contain the right amount of medicine at worst it may cause a severe side effect
3375859 it is more similar to strains previously identified in europe italy asia afghanistan and the middle east iran in 2007
3375860 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3375861 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and 2008s southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3375862 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3375863 uncertainty about virus spread and transmission is a major challenge for control campaigns increased surveillance is key to monitor the situation and keep track of virus spread

3375867 most of the infrastructure growth will come from public spending and in the current uncertain climate the threat of delays to some projects due to funding constraints is a real concern

3375894 for all that has been written and said about hillary clintons epic collapse in the democratic primaries one issue still nags everybody knows what happened but we still dont have a clear picture of how it happened or why the after battle assessments in the major newspapers and newsweeklies generally agreed on the big picture the campaign was not prepared for a lengthy fight it had an insufficient delegate operation it squandered vast sums of money and the candidate herself evinced a paralyzing schizophrenia one day a shots n beers brawler the next a hallmark channel mom through it all her staff feuded and bickered while her husband distracted but as a journalistic exercise the campaign obit is inherently flawed reflecting the viewpoints of those closest to the press rather than empirical truth how did things look on the inside as they unraveled

3375916 we view in russia an important element in the regional and global existence while we view georgia as a country with which we have friendly relations because of its experiences the state of israel should ensure that it does not intervene and that it does not abandon friends during their hour of need this is what we expected of our friends and this is what our friends expect of us and we all hope that matters there will be straightened out quickly

3376016 gmail users were without their e mail service for two hours on monday thanks to a systemwide outage beginning around 2 p m pt
3376017 was caused by a temporary outage in our contacts system that was preventing gmail from loading properly weve identified the source of this issue and fixed it
3376018 in a perfect world of software as a service downtime exists as a curious idea something people hear about but never actually see
3376019 if gmail had gone down a year ago would anyone have really cared possibly a handful of search bloggers and other googlephiles but the service goes down from here on out and its world news another sign that google has excelled yet another appliance beyond search and the business world has reacted favorably by becoming dependent upon it
3376020 this morning the problem was the most searched for term on google with five of the top ten searches referencing the issue

3376032 his leadership and participation were clear contributing factors to the overall functioning of s21 and demonstrated an intention that the staff of s21 carry out these crimes
3376033 the crimes committed at s21 themselves constituted a discreet widespread or systematic attack against the civilian population detained therein

3376036 whats the point in the conservative party having policies if we cant implement them the question why vote becomes unanswerable
3376037 the first major shift in this period was the replacement of virtue by values it was the practice of the virtues those aspects of the good that were the same for all people in all places and were what endured that gave life its structure and meaning the belief in virtue however was slowly replaced in the wider culture by that in values and values could be nothing more than personal preferences which are not normative for all people
3376038 values are not discovered by reason and it is fruitless to seek them or to find the truth or the good life
3376039 art of the royal court treasures in pietre dure from the palaces of europe
3376040 at this stage we cannot be sure if this u turn in fianna f il policy is simply the minister for education flying a kite la noel dempsey some years ago
3376041 however all three government parties went into the last election stating their unequivocal opposition to the reintroduction of fees and this is copperfastened in the programme for government
3376042 the reintroduction of college fees by fianna f il would be the most socially retrograde policy measure in a generation this is not about fairness this is not about reform this is simply about asking working irish families to stump up for the incompetence of fianna f il in managing the public finances
3376043 over the past few weeks we have heard a steadily rising chorus of calls for the reintroduction of fees from university presidents and others and it appears from comments made by minister batt okeeffe that the government is now about to capitulate to the pressure
3376044 at a time when we want to encourage more students to enter third level it would be short sighted and short termist to respond to the funding crisis by imposing what would essentially be a tax on those hoping to get a degree
3376045 le style de communication que nous utilisons avec les personnes atteintes dune maladie dalzheimer influence comment elles se per oivent elles m mes et elles vont r pondre ceux qui leur prodiguent des soins avec la pr valence croissante de la maladie dalzheimer il devient de plus en plus important pour les professionnels de sant les aidants et les familles de comprendre les effets de la maladie sur la communication et limpact de leur communication sur la qualit de vie des patients
3376046 im of the view from what ive seen that this isnt going to take a whole pile of resources this is going to take a change in management structures
3376047 from what i can see there is no uniformity across the country there are areas where they are extremely well resourced yet they have long waiting lists of child protection referrals and vice versa
3376048 its unacceptable that thats been going on for so long yes there is an issue in terms of health boards being replaced by the health service executive but its time we got on stopped making excuses and tried to find solutions
3376049 why are they being put on the front line so early in their career no doctor is allowed to perform surgery straight out of college no lawyer is allowed to run a murder trial straight out of college yet social workers are being put on the front line from day one
3376050 it seems to me that the structure there is wrong it seems to me that its leading to staff retention issues we need to ensure that a social worker on the ground who is making a decision about a child does not feel personally exposed so that there is a back up system and so the risk is shared throughout the corporate structure of the hse
3376051 it requires a change of mindset the easiest thing to do in a very heavy duty case is for a social worker to take the child into care its the easiest thing to do the risk is gone theres no problem there
3376052 the hardest thing to do is leave the child in the family and provide the services to go with that the only way we can encourage more of the latter is to have better services in place
3376053 in terms of improving funding and family support services there has been a dramatic increase in funding of these services
3376054 until we have a better picture of the lack of conformity and consistency in different health board areas it is difficult to say exactly where these gaps exist
3376055 when you look at resources required in residential provision for example its far greater than whats required for family support services
3376056 trying to persuade people that investing now will result in savings down the road its fairly self evident that that will happen
3376057 it will require buying into a system in which the fruits wont be seen for many years to come but it doesnt take any insight to know that that is the best approach
3376058 tsvangirai is moving goal posts forcing us to negotiate issues which we had already agreed upon

3376062 we were shocked and disappointed to learn our son had been involved in such an offence

3376065 aside from the challenge to develop an innovative title with spectacular levels and new controls the focus in cursed mountain is the overwhelming environment of the himalayas
3376066 it is really important to us that the player experiences natures powers as realistically as possible and that the games viewing distance allows the player to see the monumental landscapes at all times we are also going to great lengths to make the dead souls look as convincing as possible in order to deliver the level of immersion necessary for really effective and believable survival horror

3376068 the presentation at the deep silver booth will give visitors a chill guaranteed
3376069 it was decided even before last years general election that we needed a broader based leadership
3376070 sinn f in needs to develop their southern leadership and they are doing that by putting people like young councillor tomas sharkey a teacher from louth forward people like him are being given more responsibilities within the organisation adams would like to be in a position to take a back seat but he cant as the broad new leadership base needs to be developed
3376071 there was never the slightest chance of that happening you cant talk about the presidency until you have a solid base in the south
3376072 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3376073 it is clearly important that we should have capable and effective leaders and spokespeople in the south and in the six counties
3376074 the general view among my generation is that we would like people like gerry adams and pat doherty to remain on as the wisdom and experience they have from negotiations is priceless
3376075 whenever adams doherty and mitchel mclaughlin came through as leaders in the 1980s they were all in their 30s the existing leadership in the 1980s resisted them taking over yet those men are welcoming new ideas and people now
3376076 there are a lot of creative and talented people being given a free voice in the party and a lot of young councillors and members were at the forefront in the lisbon campaign
3376077 it is too early to get into speculation about the next leader the view within the party is that the new generation can rely on the experience of people like gerry adams and pat doherty which will be crucial in times ahead
3376078 the question of who might take over after adams is looming very much in the not too distant future in fairness to adams the leadership is a very stressful job and he probably needs to retire soon
3376079 if you are looking at sinn f ins leadership the big question is the division between north and south there has been a major momentum towards examining the leadership after the outcome of last years general election
3376080 adams was not au fait with the southern situation during that tv debate and it was telling that during the lisbon campaign that adamss face did not appear on posters mary lous face did appear on the posters in dublin and while she performed well in referendum debates she remains problematic and she is not the darling of the grassroots the republican constituency in dublin are not entirely happy with her compared with more traditional republicans
3376081 the prevailing view is pointing towards conor murphy as adamss successor he is personable and has a good record as a minister he is competent and clean cut he is also from south armagh he was in the ira and he has done his time which is still seen as important among northern republicans
3376082 if you look at mitchll mclaughlin you can see that this is true
3376083 there is nobody coming forward as a possible leadership candidate from belfast and this could pose problems for sinn f in one of the problems with the sdlp was the domination of derry for their leadership there will be no heave against adams he is still the man in the party when the dup were presenting difficulties in june it was adams that stood up to them and said we will call a halt to the stormont executive there has not been an executive meeting since then
3376084 the aggressor has been punished and has suffered very considerable losses
3376085 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
3376086 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
3376087 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
3376088 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
3376089 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
3376090 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
3376091 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3376092 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3376093 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good
3376094 party leader david ford claimed today that the dup and sinn fein do not want the minister to be a member of the executive meaning he or she would have no role in wider issues like the budget
3376095 so called breakthrough over the department of justice amounts to very little
3376096 apparently all the dup and sinn fein have proposed is a minister who would not even be a member of the executive
3376097 how could anyone fulfil a role as important as justice minister in those circumstances
3376098 should be a runaway winner an eye for detail humour and history i want to be him
3376099 depth variety and regular posts and a bit of politics too
3376100 a brilliant mix of humour politics and insightful analysis not just of ni but of british left politics and beyond where else do you get postings in what i assume is serbo croat beside gail walker watch and the photos attaching to the stories are usually hilarious although a disappointing absence of girls aloud as naughty schoolgirls of late
3376101 for its unusual socialist outlook on northern ireland and wider politics his is the perspective of someone who feels not unreasonably that the present party political system leaves his left wing views unrepresented as such he stands aside from the traditional ni partisan discussions a refreshing interesting and nicely written blog
3376102 is written with a certain amount of linquistic flair this is a blogger who clearly enjoys his english he also enjoys reading and gives us book reviews and cultural pieces his political position is self described as liberal unionist but his views are not entirely predictable and the items rather eclectic including a fascination with and dislike for ethnic nationalism in its east european manifestations
3376103 chekov really has a penchant for writing in a way that really grasps the reader
3376104 i hate to say it but chekov does write well
3376105 passionate unionism epitomising the pan uk unionist approach oneill synthesises an incredible amount of material for this blog a blogger with a genuine grasp of his subject
3376106 for the fact that he is in public office and combines council business and interesting outlooks generally
3376107 but only since pol omuiri came on board since then it has moved beyond a party political platform to something more considered and interesting
3376108 a group blog fairly closely associated with an identifiable political party is quite a good thing as it provides a picture of that partys id as well as a space for them to develop their thinking about issues that they will sometimes have to answer for their stance on soonish
3376109 a wee part of the blogosphere where i can be found and i shamelessly do so because it will permit me to state that the blog in question has been nominated four times in political blog categories and lost four times
3376110 i agree with its tone and attitude regarding the north of ireland situation
3376111 ignited has a grasp of the nuts and bolts of politics which i envy reading his pieces always make me view my own stuff as a bit conceptual and airy fairy a blog which is in touch with the unionist grass roots
3376112 fair deal is one of the very few bloggers delivering a dup standpoint in a thoughtful manner i rarely agree with what he says but hes always worth reading damian oloan is an excellent new addition writing coherent and temperate analysis from a liberal nationalist perspective an encouraging indication that moderation is not dead
3376113 fair deal damian oloan tom griffin patrick corrigan and very occasionally ian parsley all are delivering thoughtful and coherent articles analysing different areas of political life here
3376114 almost intimidating erudition from brian crowe as he examines the world from communitarian conservative perspective
3376115 where language literature and politics intersect some thoughtful musings on identity in relation to northern ireland from an irish ex pat
3376116 a tyrone ex pats whimsical blog where politics is viewed through the filters of sport travel identity and more recently fiction
3376117 a new collaborative venture by a number of bloggers braodly on the left it deals in political social and cultural issues as well as some humour
3376118 possibly the most impressive blog there are serious and thoughtful pieces virtually every day on a huge range of topics
3376119 serving up an interesting mix of investigative journalism and local interest
3376120 david vance really out posts the other contributors and hes from the north though id say that his focus is a good deal wider but his stuff on ni is quite astute

3376135 at level 4 in reading a pupil can read a tabloid newspaper and even read between the lines written in a tabloid newspaper and see what the moral message is but to step up to level 5 is what some appear to be struggling to do
3376136 they need to be able to understand historical and literary traditions
3376137 the difference in the levels is that at level 5 there is a need to understand such things as historical context it does mean that its quite a hard step up for quite a lot of pupils

3376145 after reviewing a number of external and internal options to support our siebel crm implementation we found the comprehensive extraprise s o s offering to be truly unique while reducing our support costs we have improved our issue resolution response time and reduced the headaches of maintaining the right blend of siebel specializations and providing 365 24 coverage furthermore our s o s resource pool shields cumis from the cost of turnover and risk of downtime related to reliance on contractors
3376146 extraprise is pleased to offer cumis the siebel support services that will enable the company to operationalize their sales and marketing programs in a manner that provides world class service while producing considerable cost savings
3376147 one consideration that companies often fail to appreciate when selecting a crm support model is that cultural elements general unfamiliarity with western sales processes and lack of proximity to the actual operational environment which are often limitations of offshore support may contribute more to support dissatisfaction than can be made up with technical expertise and low rates

3376159 todays teen driving statistics are unacceptable but can be influenced by the right kind of educational intervention
3376160 in addition to arming teens with facts and figures the year long campaign with the allstate foundation encourages teens to educate their peers about smart driving through story telling the issue is instantly brought to a more personal level and the message is harder hitting

3376265 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3376266 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3376267 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3376268 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation

3376292 its hard to turn around and say that the hd 4870 x2 is one of the most anticipated cards of recent times due to the plain fact that there have been so many cards released over the last three months while some had thought that the new hd 4870 would become the fastest single card solution on the market the price amd launched the card at gave indication that the chances were going to be pretty slim fast forward a few months and weve got a new card that sits at around the same price of the gtx 280 its packing two hd 4870 cores on a single pcb the same core speed and memory speed as its single card brethren and hopefully a whole bunch of extra performance

3376338 i have a repeated opinion on you you are trying to cross the dark nights and reach to the world of love and light your letter suggests that you are very near to that light
3376339 i remember what you had told i am happy and satisfied with my life once you had explained me about your view on love
3376340 it is better to live and laugh than to be serious all the time
3376341 everything is okay we are living and surviving but our country is in peril people are killing people of the same nationality i think there is no meaning of sympathy to man

3376358 if i were to refuse to perform a same sex wedding i could be sued i could be fined we could lose our tax exempt status
3376359 the majority opinion declared that any law that discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation will from this point on be constitutionally suspect in california the same way as laws that discriminate by race or gender making the states high court the first in the nation to adopt such a stringent standard
3376360 our assumption was when they discovered this was a worship facility they would understand
3376361 and we could work out something where they could do it somewhere else
3376362 no religious organization should be forced to use their facilities
3376363 a place of worship for things and behaviors that are completely at odds with their core christian beliefs
3376364 people want to have a relationship and if they want to make some kind of acknowledgement it should be allowed

3376392 we are encouraged by the robust revenue growth which we achieved despite the backdrop of a challenging economic environment
3376393 we believe now is an opportune time for investors to take chips off the table

3376404 how could i express what i was feeling in a way that didnt sound like bitching about george bush i mean you know i love neil young but i didnt want to listen to that record really
3376405 my reaction to that kind of record is we know this
3376406 so it started with me trying to write it as a piece of fiction i was thinking it could be the worst idea ever in the world but if it doesnt work it doesnt have to come out i started by writing a kind of world bible about what life would be like around 15 or 20 years from now if things continue on the same path i spent a few weeks filling it in with the events that could lead to this kind of time and place then as an experiment i started writing songs about people in this place and from different points of view
3376407 i had a record that would make sense to me but no one else would ever know what it was because there was no narrative its modular its a collection of snapshots these were glimpses of a place maybe with liner notes i could communicate some of it but how do you get liner notes in 2007
3376408 that was the route we were going to go with initially we talked to a different companies about releasing it but it didnt feel quite right we thought about a film but that has a different timetable and too many people need to say yes that wouldnt line up right then i started thinking about how i could make it really interactive something you experience rather than something you read

3376451 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3376452 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3376453 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3376454 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3376455 oil demand data are coming in weaker on an underlying trend basis

3376645 this study reinforces that by utilizing dicer substrate technology we can knock down the expression of a targeted gene in a way that is highly selective specific and more potent than other rnai approaches furthermore our research suggests that aptamer dsirna delivery systems may offer an important new approach to treating hiv and potentially other infectious diseases in this particular study although the aptamer provided some inhibitory function when tested in this setting alone the dsirna chimeras provided more potent inhibition than the aptamer alone thus suggesting cooperative action between the dsirna and aptamer portions in inhibiting replication and spread of hiv
3376646 the goal of this study was to define modification patterns of 27 mer dsirnas that would be useful for research purposes and would remain active at most sites in different genes regardless of sequence context based on the chemical modifications we explored in this study it appears that the 2ome modification may provide more generalized protection from immune responses than other 2 modifications
3376647 modification patterns of this kind may be useful in therapeutic applications of dicer substrate processed rnai molecules we expect that more extensively modified sequences could be developed for specific sites that would have increased nuclease stability and yet retain high potency which are desirable for pharmaceutical applications such as we are pursuing at dicerna
3376648 dicernas dicer substrate technology offers a new avenue to harness gene silencing and address the entire transcriptome for drug development these studies add to the growing body of data that will allow us to maximize the potential of this technology to develop novel potent and selective drug candidates for important unmet medical needs

3376695 hvad herren ikke ser f r jeg ikke ondt af
3376696 i victor augustus stellius mayor of the city of stella hereby authorize the usage of the darkstars to be administered by the department of defence and homeland security to any one individual who can successfully discover a way to use the unforeseen power of the darkstars for the good of all of the people throughout these stellian planets this agreement is cosigned by joseph gusta president of the stellian nation and under the agreement all persons who can awaken the power of the darkstars shall be granted a ddhs contract for the manufacture and distribution of such discovery
3376697 what is the matter you look kind of pale today
3376698 well friend the reason i am here is because of a discovery i had found in my backyard
3376699 well victor you better go back and fetch the pieces and get them ready tomorrow morning i will present the pieces to my cabinet
3376700 i cant do that joseph you know perfectly well i cant be in the same room as mary for 30 minutes without her crying false at my face
3376701 two weeks ago she recieved a letter from my sister quanisha which informed of the passing of vice president sivad she has gone to the funeral at lunia and she wont return for another two years
3376702 victor if these pieces are what you say they are then i think we have stumbled upon an amazing power source i cant wait to see these pieces myself
3376703 your father asked someone to try to examine the pieces but when he touched one it exploded the examiner was left with third degree burns on his right hand but he was alive
3376704 so it must have had some kind of protection devise installed in them
3376705 but why does it act that way mr stellius have you been able to figure it out
3376706 i am afraid not gudak the pieces seem to have a mind of own
3376707 mayor stellius we represent sasusaku robotics which is located in stellviasia we have heard from our stellia office that you found pieces which are probably a great power source our request is that we would like to use these pieces to power a new series of fighting robots we are in the process of testing
3376708 were designed to take on the shape of humans but that is their outside apperance once in combat mode they assume the bodies of dragons we had designed them to be superior in fighting skills the only thing missing is a souce needed to convert the robots from humans to dragons and so on that is why we came to you mayor stellius
3376709 these people dont want to get all of the humanoids arrogant so why tell us the names of the more powerful models
3376710 gudak i think that mr fieldbrook has something to hide he must have a superior that pulling all the strings
3376711 gudak remember that lengthy report mom made about sasusaku robotics
3376712 yeah why didnt we bring it to the hearing ill go get it
3376713 here it is the dci report on sasusaku robotics inc
3376714 sasusaku is a relatively new company founded less that two and a half years ago its parent martin technology is one the most successful companies in the nation but marttechs founder juilius a martin is a puppet master and a damn good one he doesnt care about the physical and emotional well being of all who work for him he mearly sees all his employees as tools lackeys
3376715 here is the probe report from the sbi on marktech
3376716 just admit it mr stellius you have a crush on vicki
3376717 pop this in the boom box for me mr stellius
3376718 i heard you approached stellius with a request to use that new power source he discovered good work paul couldnt have done it better myself
3376719 by the way paul how is the status of the new humanoids
3376720 one of them seems to act rebellious sir weve tried to reform him but to no avail we have to cut him off
3376721 well thats 1 down and 12 to go how are those
3376722 well sir the 12 we got are operating under full parameters and should be as powerful as they are in three years provided we get the nod from mr stellius to use the pieces
3376723 need i remind you paul that ive got a lot riding under this venture
3376724 then please dont let me down paul i mean when you have to see the gustas tomorrow
3376725 did you gather any dirt on martin that we should know about
3376726 well then you have to ask your men to step it up
3376727 because we have a conversation between martin and fieldbrook talking some kind of top secret plan
3376728 then that second man could tell us what in the blue heck martins got up his sleeve aint nothing that a little supoena woudnt fix
3376729 martin might be on to us right now his manipulation runs deep even the purest of hearts can believe his lies im very certain that he may have planted a bug to listen in right now we just dont know where it is
3376730 do you see the red light thats blinking above your brothers head
3376731 martin would do anything and darn it i mean everything to make sure we issue a blank check for the pieces but if me gudak and mr stellius have our way martin would lose this breadwinning contract now carl i want to keep looking at the tax returns financial statements balance sheets everything that proves that martins really dishing out robots
3376732 i have seen these blueprints before i was digging around some files until i have a cd rom when i loaded it it had the same blueprints along with the schematics the ones you gave me gudak these are six robots the file i read shows a series of tweve robots did fieldbrook said anything about that
3376733 no he didnt reveal the names of the more stronger models
3376734 all fieldbrook can tell us is that he will reveal the stronger models during the hearing in two weeks
3376735 you have to step it up a little bit martins been throwing his weight around for too long we need to stop his free ride
3376736 i will try senator gusta good day to you both and to you also mr stellius
3376737 please me my two associates senator udak gusta of the ninetieth district and his elder brother gudak senator of the one hundred seventh district they have come seeking the truth as well
3376738 i know why they have come with you mayor stellius
3376739 the question is can you handle what i am about to tell you
3376740 why is that that most of the friends i left back at stellia rich people like me call you a liar and radical
3376741 the girl has been through a lot mayor stellius i must ask that you go easy on her
3376742 if you can wait here i will infrom her that you are here
3376743 mayor stellius senators gusta please come in and sit down
3376744 i am sure you have plenty questions i cannot promise you i will have a logical answer for all but please ask them
3376745 i understand you know all too well about my fathers attempts to use the darkstars for some humanoids he has built but i am sure that the robots are just a cover
3376746 you see senator gusta my father julius a martin is a power hungry businessman he will do anything short of murder to accomplish his goals i am well aware of the use to which my father put sasusaku robotics he pays his friends and cronies by that name and by some way paul let this little fact slip when he wrote to you two days ago
3376747 he tried to eliminate his closest business opponent to gain a foothold on the governments new contracts for robotic work
3376748 the reason that most of sasusakus products never make to the assembly plant
3376749 is that my father always wants something that can give him the leg up on his business ventures such as the case with these humanoid robots he is claming to test right now i am not a very good businesswoman with a sharp intellect but all i know is that dad is hiding something with the production of the robots

3376757 the coach called me and was very unhappy he was asking me if all the fight we were fighting to release chinedu was just to put the boy on the bench

3376807 every time i walk out there its like im playing in my match but at the same time i have the whole u s team on my side its good i really like that feeling
3376808 obviously its a long ways away but the third round makes it closer im really excited for both of us to be playing really well for the u s
3376809 i think i play one of my best matches in the last weeks on hard court
3376810 its hard to train for singles and always dealing with swelling ive just really been playing careful with it i really wanted to be here in whatever capacity it was and it became painfully obvious to me that role was doubles i was very happy to accept that and move forward
3376811 but with the time difference im still waking up like at 5 in the morning so its good i like the early matches
3376812 my way of improving on it is to keep it up
3376813 i played really clean matches in the past the next one would be kind of streaky i dont want to do that any more i just want to keep playing the same consistency

3376818 la cessation des activit s militaires par les russes est une nouvelle que nous attendions
3376819 tu men avais parl je pense que cest une bonne nouvelle que tu nous confirmes
3376820 il est parfaitement normal que la russie veuille d fendre ses int r ts ainsi que ceux des russes en russie et des russophones lext rieur de la russie
3376821 il est normal galement que la communaut internationale veuille garantir lint grit la souverainet et lind pendance de la g orgie
3376822 je viens moscou en tant que pr sident de lunion europ enne une europe qui consid re la russie comme une grande puissance et qui peut comprendre que les derni res d cennies nont pas t faciles et apais es pour la russie

3376844 la russie a envahi un pays souverain voisin et menace un gouvernement d mocratiquement lu par son peuple une telle action est inacceptable au 21e si cle
3376845 il semblerait que des actions soient en cours pour renverser le gouvernement g orgien l gitimement lu
3376846 ces actions menacent les relations avec les etats unis et leurope
3376847 ces actions seraient en contradiction avec les assurances que nous avons re ues de la part de la russie que ses objectifs se limitaient restaurer le statu quo
3376848 il y a des preuves que les forces russes pourraient bient t bombarder la roport civil de la capitale g orgienne si ces informations sont exactes ces actions de la part des russes repr senteraient une escalade dramatique et brutale du conflit en g orgie

3376860 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3376861 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live so that was mission accomplished
3376862 it would have been prohibitive to have tried to film it live
3376863 we could not put the helicopter pilot at risk by making him try to follow the firework route
3376864 as far as we are concerned we let off the fireworks thats whats important to us
3376865 but he wouldnt have to be escorted off the premises if he had just left when he was asked to i really think he was trying to provoke an incident by refusing to leave

3376996 the odds are the retired folks theyre getting pensions theyre getting social security they have investment assets they own a house so theyre better off than somebody who is 30 or 40 years younger whos trying to buy a house and trying to start saving
3376997 if you work hard and pay into the system youve earned the right to a secure retirement
3376998 but too many seniors arent getting that security even though theyve held up their end of the bargain lower and middle income seniors are struggling as their expenses on health and energy skyrocket while their incomes do not keep pace
3376999 most low and moderate income seniors already owe no income tax among seniors with incomes below 50 000 who do owe income tax a significant number have modest incomes because they are retired but possess substantial assets
3377000 given all the problems and needs the nation faces targeting relief to this group isnt a priority
3377001 the proposal would exempt comparatively well off though not affluent senior citizens from tax and give them a benefit not generally available to working americans
3377002 helps only those low income seniors who currently pay income taxes those too poor to owe any tax arguably those most in need would get no benefit
3377003 everyone knows there would never be this 50 000 cliff

3377026 theyve crunched the numbers and concluded they cant head to the lake after a 20 percent loss in their net worth
3377027 many of my neighbors have also come out of retirement
3377028 besides the satisfaction we get from our jobs were all trying to make sure our nest eggs last as long as we do
3377029 this is just the beginning of a long term trend the changing nature of retirement income will make boomers more and more vulnerable to market downturns
3377030 i talked to my financial planner who thought i could afford to do those things even though im only 60
3377031 im debt free i dont even have a mortgage and ive been able to save for my retirement
3377032 im not hurting but im wondering whether the economy will deteriorate further
3377033 we look at what would happen to their nest egg if the market collapsed the day after they retired
3377034 then we see whether theyd have enough time to recover and enough money to live on throughout retirement
3377035 anyone who withdraws too much in a bear market especially early in retirement will outlive his money
3377036 a good rule is to take out no more than 4 percent a year that should keep a portfolio going for many years
3377037 if the market were better i wouldnt work at all
3377038 but my cardiologist tells me i may live to be 95 and my mutual funds certainly arent giving me the kind of returns ill need to last that long
3377039 because i dont see myself sitting at home and eating cat food i will keep chasing consulting jobs
3377040 even those who dont plan to move after retirement are still psychologically affected by falling home values
3377041 they look at their net worth on paper and feel poorer so they continue working

3377088 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3377089 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3377090 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species

3377363 obviously star wars was a huge opportunity for me and opened a lot of doors but just on a basic cool level i got to play darth vader its not often where you get to work on a film and run around every day with a lightsaber i really have no qualms about that character following me for the rest of my life
3377364 the very first day hayden walked out on the set with the darth vader suit was about two or three weeks before we finished shooting about 1 000 people from all over sydney came to watch it because it was like a seminal iconic moment in their life we tried to let as many people on the stage as we could
3377365 the films bind generations together it grows on the younger people because the mom and dad talk about them they develop a common bond in families
3377366 its tough on me because i have to see the movies quite a number of times to watch all the rest of me in the background
3377367 in the early days they put out an action figure that made me look like the blond guy from scooby doo but now theyre becoming a little more sophisticated theyre putting the cleft in my chin and making my hair brown instead of yellow
3377368 my daughter likes them because she can stick pins in them when shes mad at me
3377369 the first time i went to a convention i went how pathetic seeing all these people dressing up in silly costumes
3377370 well wait a minute this is exactly what i do for a job i better shut up
3377371 in 1982 i met a young kid with his dad and recently that young kid came to a convention here he had grown up and had become an animator because of the star wars movies its extraordinary how many people have caught on to george lucas dream and many of those youngsters are now working in animation studios or are directors or film cameramen its done an awful lot of good
3377372 they invited me into their family and now i can go around the world and hold my head and chin up and say im part of the lucasfilm family new zealand is such a small place i never imagined being in a movie let alone star wars when i had my first day of filming i knew as soon as the first shoot that this was my new family every time i see them they treat me like family
3377373 its been great being a part of that whole experience all of us who had the experience working with george lucas have been very fortunate were talking about a real legacy
3377374 it was the shampoo where you could twist off my head and pour liquid out of my neck lather up with leia and youll feel like a princess yourself i dont think they make it anymore but that was my favorite
3377375 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3377376 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3377377 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3377378 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3377379 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3377380 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3377381 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3377382 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3377383 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3377384 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3377385 everything is on a case by case basis meaning we as citizens have to react instead of being proactive

3377396 we knew a lot of communities around indiana were looking at the issue but its basically our opinion that the state has already pre empted the field of moving traffic violations and thats what a red light camera is set up to do to catch moving traffic violators
3377397 generally the state is the one that takes or assesses any points and they access the fee schedule obviously so i was just wondering how that was going to be handled
3377398 we did a snap shot in june of numbers at a couple of intersections without a student population
3377399 40 000 people into the community well then take another snap shot look at those intersections and continue to do our research in september which is what we had planned on and then we will go from there we will get the climate of the state and we certainly do appreciate the opinion from the attorney general
3377400 if the legislature wants to safeguard communities who want to move into this direction then they can propose legislation in the 2009 legislature that can give local units of government the ability to site people for moving violations

3377500 as we have stated in the past we are focused upon reaching profitability this transaction along with other organizational adjustments which have been recently made reduces our net cash expenses by approximately 500 000 per year or approximately 20 as a management team we have been investigating for some time options to reduce our expense level in order to minimize the amount of required external funding and accelerate our ability to achieve profitability from operations in that light we felt it appropriate to focus on our revenue generating instrumentation related products and technologies realizing meaningful cost savings via this transaction with aspera as an alternative to curtailing some or all research and development activities on the scientific applications in order to achieve the cost savings was a much better alternative for our shareholders additionally as the granted licenses are non exclusive we retain the ability to partner with others in these areas or to further develop the technologies ourselves

3377540 our growth both externally as well as internally was massive the sheer number of new servers and their associated applications proved especially challenging as we attempted to reconcile our business expansion within the physical limits of our current infrastructure we knew virtualization was a means through which we could effectively and intelligently approach our integration challenges

3377662 this is the first war that the united states has fought where so many of the people and resources involved arent of the military but from contractors
3377663 it was considered an all out imperative by the administration to keep troop levels low particularly in the beginning of the war and one way that was done was to shift money and manpower to contractors but that has exposed the military to greater risks from contractor waste and abuse
3377664 it is a shocking number but i still dont think it is the full cost
3377665 i dont think there have been any credible cost numbers for the iraq war there was so much money spent at the beginning of the war and nobody knows where it went
3377666 these new numbers point to the overall question when do you cross the line in terms of turning over too much of the public mission of defense to private firms
3377667 there are some things that are appropriate for private companies to do but others things that are not but we dont seem to have had a strategy for determining which was appropriate and which wasnt we have just handed over functions to contractors in a very haphazard way

3377695 homes are around for a long time if the whole state of wisconsin opts into a revised code substantial energy could be saved and carbon dioxide emissions reduced using technology that is already out there

3377702 high commodity prices allow commercial farmers in developed countries to cope with high fertiliser prices but rising food prices hurt subsistence farmers particularly in africa
3377703 people just cannot afford fertiliser they were in dire straits before but now the situation is worse

3377917 demonstrate that it is a volatile region it is a crucial region for getting caspian oil to consumer markets
3377918 with negligible domestic oil production unlike some of its caspian neighbours georgias significance to global oil and gas markets is as a transit corridor
3377919 threat of an attack on the btc baku tblisi ceyhan pipeline poses the bigger risk to oil markets it is clear that more generally georgia is a key energy transit hub in the caucasus region and a country of significant strategic importance to energy markets
3377920 the outage on the btc pipeline and recent hostilities in the caucasus highlight the potentially precarious nature of pipeline energy supplies in the region
3377921 with the btc currently closed disruption to georgian energy infrastructure further limits the possibility of getting caspian oil and gas to markets
3377922 renewed flows through georgia expected from september could be further delayed if the line is damaged during the russia georgia conflict
3377923 along the same corridor runs the south caucasus gas pipeline a branch of this pipeline continues through to the russian port of tuapse transiting the region of abkhazia another georgian area affected by separatist action where russian troops are reportedly also being mobilised

3377961 i really didnt know what to expect coming in but its been a lot of fun just to come down here meet some of the guys in the system meet the coaching staff and just kind of see the facilities i know im still young and i have to work my way up but its something that im definitely going to work hard at hopefully ill be able to play my game while helping the team out as much as i can
3377962 developmental camp was a crazy week for our coaches with all the players here but we did have some instructional meetings in the locker room
3377963 they just tried to stress the importance of playing good sound defense and to always keep your feet moving its something where im definitely going to concentrate on adding those aspects into my game on a consistent basis and hopefully theyll be satisfied
3377964 im out to be the best all around defenseman possible
3377965 i like to take care of defense first and then chip in offensively when needed but really i just want to be a good team player capable of sticking up for teammates and myself while trying to help out the team in any way
3377966 itll be pretty crazy watching players i admired growing up bearing down on me and playing against them itll be a great experience
3377967 at camp the guys who were drafted really took it to the next level and even though many arent in the nhl yet the pace was much faster and the players were a lot quicker and stronger its interesting to see where i fit in among the group
3377968 i suppose im fitting in because the guys around here are starting to call me chuck norris
3377969 i guess they feel i look a little like him that was the funny thing around camp all week
3377970 tobias made a good impression and has really done well for himself and itll be great to have a chance to play on a team with a guy like that
3377971 i think the team and fans of atlanta are really looking forward to moving ahead this coming season and obviously management has made some changes that we all hope will pay off
3377972 ve been depending almost exclusively on the sigma 50mm f1 4 ex dg hsm lens during my first few days in beijing in part as i anticipated its because im working indoors as we prepare for the launch of the olympics
3377973 in truth it has proved a lot more difficult than i anticipated for my family to settle in the area and the club has been very supportive and understanding of my decision

3378018 as an interpreter my job is talking to and interpreting what the iraqi people are saying feeling and believing about the country the coalition forces and the iraqi army
3378019 ive talked to like a million iraqis and a million american soldiers i mean who did that i dont think anyone has done that before
3378020 theres a bigger price on their heads than there is on ours
3378021 at that time i was kind of broke i didnt have a job
3378022 so the money that he paid me was good for me even though it was 80
3378023 when the americans came here they didnt know anything about this country the culture the streets and how to deal with iraqis so i believed we should stand and help them and i did
3378024 i think some of the impressions the americans had when they first came have been changed
3378025 this is why some of the mistakes that happened in the past are now getting fixed because they know more about the iraqis and they can handle the situation better than when they first came here
3378026 when you get away from the dreams and the ambitions i believe i lost my life i lost my life as an iraqi citizen
3378027 i cant walk in the streets and the markets and be normal just like anyone

3378035 the timing is right for this demonstration weve seen a massive increase of interest in targeted advertising and are already working with iptv broadcasters network owners and vendors not to mention advertising agencies and brands mobile tv is a vital part of the rapidly changing world of tv and is a vital part of our roadmap like packet vision udcast is a pioneer in its particular area of innovation with a proven track record and global reach so there is a natural synergy between the two companies
3378036 we expect targeted advertising to be an important element of mobile tv business models including free to air services where finding ways to generate revenue from advertising will be essential udcasts mobile tv solutions are compliant with majority of standards deployed across the world we are in an ideal position to provide the global platform for delivering mobile tv so it makes sense to work with packet vision which we believe is at the forefront of delivering targeted advertising technology on ip video networks

3378056 we are committed to improving the way we deal with rape and domestic violence cases which are among the most serious crimes we deal with
3378057 the rape and domestic violence policies are an important part of the cps violence against women strategy which sets out how we deal with crimes of violence against women these crimes not only have a devasting impact on the victims but on their friends and families as well
3378058 revising our policies means we make sure they are current and relevant they set out for victims their families witnesses and the general public what they can expect from the cps and that our aim is to prosecute cases effectively we welcome the views of the public to help us achieve this
3378059 i am proud that we have achieved a step change in the way we address domestic violence over recent years and the cps has played a pioneering role in this area
3378060 their updated policy reflects changes since 2005 such as the roll out of statutory charging better training for cps staff special domestic violence courts and measures for victims and witnesses which together have brought about substantial improvement
3378061 there is much more to do but we are succeeding in reducing the prevalence of domestic violence and the number of related homicides the increase in successful convictions up to 70 is a significant improvement against the background of an increasing volume of prosecutions
3378062 rape is an appalling crime we are consulting on this policy in keeping with the significant steps taken by the government to improve justice for complainants
3378063 victim care is now managed by dedicated units pre trial witness interviews are available and improved special measures ensure that a witness can give their evidence at its best
3378064 perhaps most importantly we have introduced independent sexual violence advisors who befriend a complainant and support her together with the rape specialist prosecutors and police officers throughout the process
3378065 i have made a decision to end the operation to force the georgian authorities to peace
3378066 the operation has achieved its goal security for the peacekeepers and civilians has been restored the aggressor was punished suffering huge losses
3378067 it is understandable that russia wants to protect its compatriots and russian speakers interests abroad and it is also understandable that the international community wants to protect georgias sovereignty security and territorial integrity
3378068 russia can use its might to ensure peace this is the reason why i am in moscow
3378069 russia supports the osce and eu line that a ceasefire agreement is absolutely essential but we have questions over several points
3378070 we can hardly agree to this as it implies that georgian so called peacekeepers should be in south ossetia georgian peacekeepers cannot be there they committed crimes shooting their own russian colleagues with whom they were serving
3378071 separate georgian military groups are sporadically attacking the positions of russian peacekeepers
3378072 has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3378073 we have decided that georgia will leave the cis we urge ukraine and other countries to also leave the commonwealth of independent states which is dominated by russia
3378074 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3378075 the cold war has long ended but this mentality has remained firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats

3378078 we urge ukraine and other countries to also leave the commonwealth of independent states which is dominated by russia
3378079 we have taken the decision to declare russian armed forces in abkhazia and south ossetia occupying forces
3378080 has killed our russian citizens ordered the crushing of women and children by tanks and the burning alive of a group of girls herded into a cattle shed
3378081 and not only did he do all this with a background of european flags but he declared that he was safeguarding american values

3378088 la clave estuvo en el primer set le quebraron el primero luego recuper el quiebre y ah lleg hasta el tie break hasta ah el partido era muy parejo y yo pensaba en ese momento que todav a pod a ganarle a nalbandi n pero claramente la clave fue el tie break porque nico empez mal y luego ya no se pudo recuperar el segundo set fue mucho m s dif cil a mediados de ese set tuvo un quiebre y nalbadi n hizo un primer saque a tres cuartos de velocidad y eso le falt a nicol s haber metido m s primeros servicios en los puntos clave

3378093 based on anecdotal accounts in our discussions with online brokerages both the number of attacks and dollar volume of losses has grown over the past two years
3378094 the reason for that is that most of the controls are retrospective theyre designed to go in after the attack and find the perpetrators

3378099 recently i blogged about my excitement regarding the san francisco momas decision to begin allowing photography in their permanent collection after years of maintaining a closed no photography policy directly because of this change in policy i decided to purchase a family membership in order to support the museum both with my artistic energy and financially i was excited to begin spending regular time exploring and documenting the museum
3378100 a man who works for nothing is never out of work
3378101 well i didnt quite expect the simon blint fiasco that resulted in my forceful ejection from the sf moma on friday to generate quite the attention that it has that said ive had 48 hours or so now to reflect on the incident more and i wanted to share more of my thoughts and feelings i also want to take an opportunity to clear up some misconceptions and allegations that have been raised due to the incidents popularity on the internet

3378107 i come from a moral background and i can see the power of the show and imagine my old school teachers cringing or my grandparents thinking oh my god when they see me say having sex on a barstool
3378108 theyre not stupid and its not like were making an instruction manual telling them how to drink and do drugs or have sex were just laying out how it is you have to remember this is not a reality show its supposed to be pure entertainment
3378109 from crowd to players to management and directors at plymouth there was an apprehension with the change in personnel we have had to have over the last 18 months
3378110 we are short i still think there are two or three players we need to really put an edge to us but i would rather be in that position at this moment in time and have that bonus that we are going to bring in two or three more players
3378111 managers before me have had the great backbone of the old guard but we are now having to rebuild from scratch and it takes time for that transition to kick in
3378112 given that we were up against a club that has spent a lot of money i have to be pleased with what i saw out there he added
3378113 the way ive been looking at it at the moment is i cant control whether the club wants me for next year or whether they dont
3378114 all i can do is try to get myself fit
3378115 as i said its been unfortunate that ive had a few injuries but the rest of my body feels really good and i certainly want to play on next year so ill leave that in the hands of the club
3378116 thommo has worked really hard to come back from his knee injury and played an important role for the team on the weekend
3378117 at the moment he is focussed on getting himself as fit as possible
3378118 we will turn our attention to the longer term future of all of our senior players at the end of this season
3378119 i certainly do think that another pre season would do me the world of good i still think that i can play at this level if i didnt think that i would certainly hang up the boots
3378120 there isnt room for everyone up there someones going to miss out
3378121 one the most difficult thing to do in rugby is to win away from home in the tri nations and it usually only happens once a year

3378129 he was aspiring to be an actor out there he was trying to get into the acting business and he thought it was a more appropriate name
3378130 there is nothing wrong with using aliases as long as you dont use it to defraud
3378131 ive got to be perfectly honest and ive said this to the players im not bothered about rotherham and bournemouth he insisted
3378132 if we go about our job and show the right attitude and the right commitment the right work ethic allied with the ability and technical side of it we can win football matches
3378133 its down to us its got nothing to do with rotherham and bournemouth obviously they are our nearest opponents but well just be concerned with how we approach the season the key to us staying up is a good start and good home form i honestly believe that if we only lose one or two games at home this season well stay up
3378134 the first half excited me i think we had 12 corners we delivered balls into the box but we need someone on them their first shot was a goal the goals weve we gave away have been a trait for this club for some time and weve got to get rid of it
3378135 i was disappointed with certain aspects of the defending weve just thrown a team together in the last two to three weeks so its very difficult to gel some of the players dont even know each other so its a building process
3378136 the first half heartened me but if we keep giving away silly goals we will have a mountain to climb
3378137 im glad were finally here it has been a long long road everyone here at the football club has been working all the hours that god sends to get the club out of administration locate players and work to bring them into the club and its been a magnificent effort by everyone
3378138 but also those loyal fans who have been fantastic theyve stuck by this club through thick and thin theyve had a rough time and deserve better than what has been served up to them in the past few years and im hoping to give it to them
3378139 not surprised if there isnt much of a drop off from the line this fall
3378140 the arrival of incoming freshman and high school all american brittni hamilton
3378141 we make a living by what we get but we make a life by what we give
3378142 success is always temporary when all is said and done the only thing youll have left is your character
3378143 with respect to parramatta i think the roosters were a little unlucky in many ways i was at the game live and i think they got some tough calls
3378144 if anthony tupou puts the ball down with a minute to go they probably win the game
3378145 parramatta played alright but im comfortable the way were travelling the last few games also
3378146 were not afraid to play this side next monday night and im certainly not going to add to any fear by telling them weve lost six in a row thats a very negative attitude
3378147 plenty of sides have shown they can beat parramatta and were no different
3378148 okay we havent had a lot of wins against them but theres plenty of teams we havent had a lot of wins against like penrith melbourne
3378149 what happened second half last week let alone last year five years ago means nothing if you worry about putting your left shoe on before you put your right shoe on because youre superstitious and you start letting those things get into your head we dont worry about those things
3378150 one the most difficult thing to do in rugby is to win away from home in the tri nations and it usually only happens once a year
3378151 im not sure if ill be playing wing so i dont think ill have to worry about it
3378152 its going to be sad and hard to leave that but thats footy
3378153 you can see when lockyer comes back in the team i actually score and when hes away i dont score that many
3378154 weve trained together for a few years now and this is my first full year in first grade and were definitely getting a combination going
3378155 hopefully that can blossom at the end of the season so we do it in the finals
3378156 one the most difficult thing to do in rugby is to win away from home in the tri nations and it usually only happens once a year

3378171 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it to other providers
3378172 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information

3378174 just a huge relief it feels like a big relief off my shoulders im sure it is for everybody in this room standing next to us because weve committed a lot to it ive come along way ive dragged my family halfway around the world away from my dad and mom and everybody who needs me back in australia and today it just feels like its worthwhile it feels like ive conquered a huge mountain and its just a great day

3378176 with the recent release of the new ati 48xx gpus weve seen something that we havent seen for a while ati gpus in a direct head to head competition with the offerings from nvidia not only in a price for performance standpoint like usual but from a performance standpoint the ati 4870 gpu has been putting out synthetic benchmark numbers that rival the gtx 260 up and coming 4870x2 offerings are sure to put the gtx 280 by the side of the road from a performance standpoint we are lucky enough to have a sapphire hd 4870 on hand to test and today were going to see if ati has indeed managed to pull one out of the hat to level the playing field with the current offerings from nvidia
3378177 this is just what thermalright did with the ifx 14 the cooler consists of twin towers linked by a set of heat pipes now i am not going to give you all the features here in the introduction but i will tell you the cooler does come with a little surprise something that no other cooler comes with if you want to know what it is then you will have to continue reading
3378178 for the last two or so years it seems that amd has not be able to get out of its own way from horribly timed acquisitions to botched chipsets and gpu cpus these last few years have been painful to watch as amd has had one failure after another but recently someone at amd or more probably several someones made a decision to move back into more comfortable territory instead of trying to compete head to head at the high end level amd seems to have returned to an earlier philosophy one that caught the minds and wallets of the diyers and enthusiasts
3378179 the hd 4850 is the card that has put amd ati back on the graphics card map over the past month while the hd 3850 and hd 3870 were both good cards a constant line up of nvidia cards along with price drops meant that the aging technology was having trouble keeping up with cards not only in a similar price bracket but cheaper again the latest hd 4850 to come into the labs is from gigabyte and before we get stuck into the performance side of things we will have a look at the package and whats inside as well as the card itself so lets not ramble on anymore and just get stuck into it
3378180 while we concentrate on this sector the focus is now moving towards the lower end of the spectrum via has really cornered this market in the past when it came to ultra compact pcs epia has been vias biggest success and with the evolution of the via processors each generation has gotten just that little bit more capable now intel has seen just how popular this is we finally have some competition in this sector today we will be pitting the atom platform against the nano platform who has the best performance and energy savings well we dont know yet but by the end of this we will have an informative answer to that lets move on and check out the platforms individually before we get into the testing phase
3378181 i hate to admit it but i havent been in the amd game for a long time the last amd i owned was a barton 2500 dont get me wrong this isnt going to be an intel fanboy writing an amd motherboard review ive been a long time fan of amd dating back to the k5 series but the truth is outside of some exceptional video cards amd hasnt given us a whole lot to get excited about lately however when one of my favorite video card companies tells me they have gotten together with dfi to create a sweet amd motherboard its time to get excited about amd again lets take a look at what sapphire has created with a little help from dfi
3378182 i love to know what magic its engineers infused into the biostar tpower i45 motherboard to make it an overclocking monster but reaching 600mhz fsb with this board is a real possibility on first glance the biostar tpower i45 motherboard has the appearence of a standard mid range enthusiast friendly platform but its not until you start overclocking that its true potential becomes apparent as well see later in the review the tpower i45 is based on intels new and very popular p45 express and ich10r chipsets
3378183 we respect the fact they are a really good side but were looking forward to taking them on
3378184 we think and we know we can beat them for us its a big challenge
3378185 were not going to be intimidated by them but were going to go out there and give it a crack and look forward to it
3378186 im really looking forward to the game and i know the guys are you see a really big challenge against a team like this and one that could really shape our season
3378187 weve been pretty lucky with the way the results have fallen and now the ball is firmly in our court with three games to go
3378188 if we can win two or three of them we can really get ourselves up for another crack at it
3378189 its up to us now theres no excuses and theres no point on relying on other games weve had our luck in that respect its up to us
3378190 geelong are doing everything right and certainly look on course to put their name out there in respect to teams like that
3378191 were happy to take them on wherever i think anz stadium is going to be really good its going to be a finals type atmosphere on the ground and if we can get a big crowd out there it should help
3378192 its a good question hopefully roosy swans coach paul roos has got a few things to tell us this week a few secrets
3378193 they are just one of those sides that they havent got any real major weaknesses you can pick out they are really good all over the field
3378194 they dont rely on any one forward and as a defence coming in against a team like that it makes it pretty difficult to plan
3378195 theyve got threats everywhere and probably one of the biggest advantage of our defence is we can be pretty versatile and we are going to have to be this week

3378234 bent only played at the end of last season but tottenham paid a lot of money to sign him two years ago and he was a very important player at charlton bladini told me he played very well so we will have to wait and see
3378235 the most important games will be played on sunday so it is dangerous said capello who is also yet to name his permanent captain with john terry steven gerrard and rio ferdinand the players reported to be in contention for the armband
3378236 we will qualify for the world cup we will be in south africa i am sure of it he insisted
3378237 spain were the best team at the euros they won because they played with confidence the other countries played with a lot of spirit and the level of the players was good but we are at the same level or even better
3378238 we have to play with spirit and we have to play with confidence it is down to me to transmit that the players believe in themselves that is why they have improved their game
3378239 i think vocally it was a really strong performance while you didnt do a lot to the song in terms of trying making it your own you did a really good job of it
3378240 while you sang just fine it came across as elvira mistress of the dark singing a feist song
3378241 you rode the melody so well and the physicality of the performance was really killing
3378242 that performance is a really interesting study its the truest and best thing that youve done but what it says to me is youre in this rufus wainwright kind of vibe and i wonder whether canada is ready to embrace that as an idol
3378243 when you play piano and you sing theyre so interconnected its hard to understand whether youre playing piano its all one
3378244 i really thought that was a comfortable performance you took ownership of that song
3378245 i kept on wanting you to get more integrated into the band and now i realize you just had to get rid of the band
3378246 i think joel plaskett will be very happy because hell sell a lot of downloads by tomorrow
3378247 it was good but im sure it scared the hell out of my grandma
3378248 its very hard to do a song by the tragically hip because gords phrasing is in a certain way i have never seen someone reinvent a hip song until tonight
3378249 that particular performance the band got ahead of you you werent as powerful as the music was in that song
3378250 when you got to that soft part that was the money
3378251 i thought your voice sounded really good you have a particular niche you really need to thrust yourself through youre an emotional guy but you dont push you need to be a little more animated
3378252 i didnt like when you were being jt lite and now youre being more honestly you being this rock guy and i honestly just dont like it
3378253 ive never seen an idol grow as much as you have had on this show
3378254 youre an old soul probably the most exciting thing ive seen in a long time

3378259 i dont know whose idea this song is at the start because it seems to put everyone in a bit of a depression simpson was sacked in november 2007
3378260 you mean they built another meijer like 3 miles away from here

3378265 no one involved in the advert appears to have considered it inappropriate nor contemplated the manner in which it could be interpreted in china and elsewhere
3378266 someday ill eventually see more than just a flat concrete jungle
3378267 more or less the side that played against lazio in their last friendly match will be the one that plays on wednesday most of the senior players were involved this will be the side that plays against standard liege
3378268 the situation has been very difficult for us we have had a lot of players returning to training late after international games in the summer and now we have players at the olympics
3378269 i believe we are ready for the champions league tie the experienced players are ready but we know that we have quality from the young players
3378270 we have to make the decision but i believe he will play he has worked very hard since he has come back you cannot say he will be at his best but he will be fit enough
3378271 at 21 he already has a lot of experience and he is an intelligent boy but i would not like to put too much pressure on him we know every single player in his area is very important and now he has maybe more experience than the others now
3378272 to win big trophies like euro 2008 makes you more confident and gives you something you can pass on to the team around you

3378314 my ambition has always been to play for my national team and i believe that playing in the biggest league in the world for aston villa will help me realise that
3378315 when i told martin bain rangers chief executive on sunday that i wanted to leave i did so with sadness the rangers supporters have been fantastic to me but i am young and want to play at the highest level and i hope they will always welcome me back i want to thank them for everything
3378316 it wasnt a difficult choice to make coming here everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3378317 as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come to pompey
3378318 i think pompey are a top five premier league side and i believe i can achieve what i want to achieve at this club weve got the uefa cup as well and i want to go a long way in that
3378319 we are stepping up and doing what we need to do to straighten this thing out
3378320 there are two good people that for different reasons arent part of this organization today and thats a shame
3378321 the fact is the players have to look deep inside themselves and understand they have to be responsible for some of this the galaxy hasnt made the play offs for a couple years punting on this season is not acceptable
3378322 ivan has a wealth of experience having played at the highest level for many years and he can be a great asset for us the young players at this club will really benefit from having him around the place

3378708 the scottish government is determined to help the fishing industry adapt to high fuel costs and although we cant control the price of fuel we will do what we can to help in other ways
3378709 the fishing industry has been particularly hard hit with the crippling increase in fuel prices fuel costs count for as much as half the earnings of boats and cannot be passed on
3378710 through the fuel task force we have worked closely with the industry to pull together the outline of a three year plan of action that will help the fishing industry in scotland adapt to cope with rising fuel costs
3378711 the scottish government has earmarked almost 29 million a combination of scottish and european funds to support this plan of action and deliver change across the fleet and the onshore sectors money will start to become accessible within the next few weeks
3378712 despite limited resources we are willing to do all we can to make these go as far as possible to help our fishermen and the industries and communities they support i am disappointed at the continuing lack of financial support from the uk government and will continue to press for this
3378713 we cannot alone address the wider economic impact of rising fuel prices that responsibility rests with ministers in london and we are continuing to press hard for action to restrain energy costs and reflate the economy but where we can we will act
3378714 the measures i have outlined today set out the steps which need to be taken over the next three years to ensure the fishing sector is economically and environmentally sustainable
3378715 i firmly believe that the scottish fishing industry has a vibrant future as a key part of our thriving coastal communities

3378741 californias budget impasse which hits day 42 today may get a lot worse if gov arnold schwarzenegger and the democratic controlled legislature do not reach a compromise in the coming days
3378742 two significant pieces of the budget negotiations that require voter approval will miss the deadline for making the november ballot in about a week making them no longer viable
3378743 time is quickly running out for schwarzeneggers proposal to borrow against future state lottery sales to help erase the current 17
3378744 budget overhaul is the other issue republicans want to go before voters in the fall and it is perhaps even more significant because it has been a rallying cry of the states republican lawmakers
3378745 taking lottery and budget overhaul off the negotiating table could aggravate the already polarized budget debate between the governor and the legislature capitol observers say
3378746 if that happens youll see this budget dug in and youll see the longest impasse ever and thats unfortunate said assembly republican leader mike villines from clovis fresno county
3378747 facing a deadline for action the state assembly is expected to approve a bill amending the high speed rail bond on the november ballot
3378748 state controller john chiang has until noon today to respond to gov arnold schwarzeneggers request to get moving on the state pay cuts schwarzenegger has said he will go to court to force action if the controller does not comply with his order reducing most state workers pay to the 6 55 an hour federal minimum wage
3378749 theyre probably not openly discussing future judgeships or cushy jobs for termed out lawmakers but they probably should be
3378750 the governor and democrats need at least two republican pickoffs in the senate they need at least seven in the assembly one extra because assemblywoman nell soto d pomona 82 has been incapacitated
3378751 this legislature still can avoid breaking the all time mark for late budget passage 60 days recorded on aug 31 2002
3378752 but theyll need to listen to otto van bismarck and artfully play the game
3378753 thanks to a showdown with gov arnold schwarzenegger over state paychecks chiang who lives in torrance with his wife has emerged from the obscurity of his office to become a hero to state employees
3378754 w hen schwarzenegger issued the executive order on july 31 to slash state workers salaries chiang announced that he would not comply with it
3378755 while the governors office argues that case law requires chiang to obey the order chiang has said that doing so would expose the state to liability and would not improve its financial position
3378756 yesterday the governor sent some of his computer experts to try to help him comply with the law said aaron mclear a spokesman for the governor
3378757 in a setback for opponents of gay marriage a sacramento judge friday left intact a ballot title that states proposition 8 eliminates the right of same sex couples to marry
3378758 petitioner has failed to explain why the term eliminates is inherently argumentative while the term limit is not frawley said in his eight page ruling
3378759 the measures title was reworded after the state supreme court in may overturned a ban on gay marriages in california
3378760 significantly schwarzeneggers proposals contain no money to help cover some of the estimated 6 6 million residents who are uninsured about half of those people would have been covered under schwarzeneggers unsuccessful 14 billion overhaul
3378761 some of the ideas are contained in bills traveling through the legislature other proposals dont yet have lawmakers to carry them raising doubts that schwarzenegger can get them through the state senate and assembly before the session ends this month
3378762 on top of that the governor recently threatened to veto all bills sent to him until the legislature sends him a budget
3378763 further these policies are offered at a time when schwarzenegger has proposed cutting billions from health programs to help close a huge budget deficit
3378764 assembly bill 2270 by assemblymen would allow cities counties and special districts whichever entity oversees wastewater to ban water softeners
3378765 would authorize any local agency that maintains a community sewer system to take action to control residential salinity inputs including those from water softeners
3378766 legislation died in an assembly committee this week that would have slapped higher taxes on businesses that sell or produce sexually explicit shows films books magazines or internet programming
3378767 calderons assembly bill 2914 stated that adult entertainment causes numerous health safety and societal problems including reducing property values in affected neighborhoods and encouraging unsafe sex and aggressive attitudes toward women
3378768 opponents argued that their sex life is none of the legislatures business and that singling out adult materials would violate free speech rights and be difficult to enforce or define
3378769 when voters overwhelmingly approved jessicas law in fall 2006 many assumed it would lock away predatory child molesters and rapists who had slipped through the cracks of existing law
3378770 as a times investigation reported sunday the law has led far more sexual offenders to be evaluated and recommended for indefinite hospitalization after their prison terms end but the number of commitments has barely budged
3378771 in the 18 months after jessicas law took effect only 42 of 67 defendants in civil commitment trials 63 were sent to hospitals compared with 41 of 51 80 before the law

3378793 make sure you drive to les tipaniers resort park outside and walk through to the beach here you can hire a kayak and paddle across to two nearby motus little islands in between the two motus is a beautiful lagoon with crystal clear water and lots of sea life
3378794 we pass under a low bridge and are now traveling through the hanalei national wildlife refuge home to many endangered birds such as black necked stilts and hawaiian geese in fact the best way to observe the birds of the wetlands is by boat as access onto the refuge itself is restricted silently we glide along the placid river going at my easy pace occasionally an oar splashes rousting a cattle egret in a flapping flash of white
3378795 this was an easy kayaking excursion that included instruction and a 3 hour guided wilderness paddle around fox island one of the worlds finest paddling locations and an interesting mix of temperate rain forest sculpted cliffs protected coves and long pebbled beaches
3378796 kayaking at the dead tree valley is a unique and astonishing experience and a must when visiting chilo to be alone in a kayak surrounded by dead trees wetlands and rare endemic birds that stay quiet while you photograph them makes you feel transported in time four different rivers give you alternative landscapes to enjoy all calm water
3378797 eventually youll come to a bay opening to your left enter this bay here in the entrance is some of the finest and most colorful snorkeling ive ever experienced in fact the fish were so prolific that when i dropped a cracker in the water it literally boiled and fish jumped into my kayak

3378989 if you write a letter to the editor attacking bush you could be deemed as purposefully and materially supporting hostilities against the united states if you organize or join a public demonstration against iraq or against the administration the same designation could befall you one dark comedy aspect of the legislation is that senators or house members who publicly disagree with bush criticize him or organize investigations into his dealings could be placed under the same designation in effect congress just gave bush the power to lock them up
3378990 it has become clear in recent months that a critical mass of the american
3378991 right you are correct someone hooked me i do believe in building relationships that is what christians are required to do i am amoral i am sure you know what that means so are scorpios i am being protected by the formosa rule because of my mental illness i am not targeting teh mop jockey you are and you are using me as a bait please stop i have my own fish to reel in leave me alone it is my hope that i will be able to catch a fish and reel it in for you once my retired bishop thought i was fishing for him and he took the bait alas it wasnt me and that spelled the demise of our relationship have a little bit more faith in me an eastern orthodox bishop thought i was fishing for him and willingly proudly and defiantly took the bait on public record and it wasnt even me give me a break
3378992 typically small month to month appreciation is present in the summer due to increased seasonal housing demand
3378993 therefore strengthening of the market in the summer can occur even when the longer term market trend might be downward
3378994 the gap between the two positions on the issue of borders is still wide
3378995 we hope the israeli side will stick to the agreement to continue negotiations away from the media and not to begin engagement in the blame game
3378996 more work still needs to be done and we are committed to continuing the effort to try to reach a joint israeli palestinian document
3378997 russia must reverse the course it appears to be on
3378998 if these reports are accurate these actions would be inconsistent with the assurances we received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in georgian breakaway region south ossetia that existed before the fighting began on august 6
3378999 these actions jeopardize russians relations with the united states and europe
3379000 i cant see us accepting this french draft of this resolution
3379001 we will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this
3379002 there are no discussions about the u s getting involved militarily
3379003 when you lose a race like that it motivates me even more to try to swim faster
3379004 i just wanted to be out at the 50 meter point and thats where i was
3379005 i was in open water and it was difficult for the other guys to see me
3379006 i knew park is strong in the last 50 meters
3379007 so i knew i had to be fast and concentrated
3379008 i just tried to swim my own race hes going to go out but i cant let that affect my race strategy
3379009 to be tied for the most olympic golds of all time with those names in olympic history
3379010 the olympics have been around for so many years thats a pretty amazing accomplishment
3379011 i set up an opportunity to have a perfect swim tomorrow
3379012 it might be once in a century you see something like this
3379013 hes not just winning hes absolutely destroying everything its awesome to watch
3379014 its his physical ability its his ability to race its his ability to keep focused to get excited when he needs to and to come down when he needs to come down
3379015 im so glad to have this race behind me because theres so much pressure
3379016 i tried to keep myself as mentally strong as possible
3379017 last year in melbourne at the world championships one swim started it and then swims just started happening one after another after another we had a great morning this morning and hopefully we can set up some more good swims tonight and keep the ball rolling
3379018 it almost felt like less pressure because it wasnt initially my event
3379019 i dont think its necessarily fair what happened but rules are rules and im just doing what im told
3379020 i just wanted to win my heat and set everything up for tomorrow
3379021 just get through that and prepare myself for tomorrow thats the most important thing an afternoon off and its time to just sort of get as rested as i can recover and i probably have to re shave get all of that stuff down
3379022 enter into immediate talks about resolving the investigation as that would be in the best interests of both consumers nationwide as well as wachovia customers
3379023 essencial per a la mediaci constructiva en els conflictes i l xit de les operacions de pau

3379025 sabem que per a defensar determinats interessos es fa necessari repetir amb insist ncia algunes idees clau per a sostenir los els interessos fins a convertir les en veritat aparentment objectiva dhuc sabent que pugui donar se la possibilitat de demostrar que s n una fal l cia les idees aix com els arguments que les sustenten
3379026 were really talking about taking a look with a very different lens
3379027 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3379028 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3379029 the national interest requires that the girl should have good looks and a good grasp of the song and look good on screen
3379030 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3379031 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3379032 this is like a voice over for a cartoon character
3379033 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3379034 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one
3379035 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation
3379036 the most disappointing thing the most incredible thing is that nobody caught it
3379037 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3379038 its sort of edgy territory but we felt that as long as the focus was on the actors who were trying to do something to be taken seriously thats going too far or wrong that was where the humor would come from
3379039 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3379040 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim
3379041 the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3379042 movies about the mentally retarded is something we talked about for a long time my grandfather was adopted by a mentally retarded man a man who shouldnt have been allowed to adopt a kid
3379043 when he saw forrest gump you never saw a guy angrier than him it was not such a picnic to be raised by that guy
3379044 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future
3379045 however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3379046 oil demand data are coming in weaker on an underlying trend basis
3379047 this only reinforces the view that high prices are beginning to play a central role in determining demand at least for the oecd countries
3379048 remains high by any measure sustaining inflationary concerns not least in developing importer countries
3379049 as of monday gasoline prices in the u s fell by 7 1 cents or 1 9 percent to a national average uss 3 809 a gallon 3 8 liters a three month low
3379050 however gasoline at the pump still averaged 82 3 cents above last years pace
3379051 we show up even when were tired or grumpy or weve had the longest day its good company and you leave feeling really energized
3379052 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3379053 in fact getting married increases ones risk for eventual marital dissolution and marital dissolution seems to be worse for self rated health now than at any point in the past three decades
3379054 the second printing is as rare as the first its a very valuable book so its an obvious one to put up for sale
3379055 claims are made about irreplaceable sagacity supposedly offered by players in washingtons floating brahmin crapgame
3379056 more often than not fundraising prowess and sycophancy win the edge as much as any evidence of brain power whats wrong with some fresh talent especially behind candidates who roam the nation proclaiming the era of change
3379057 if i tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock will you give me one

3379060 showing absolutely no indication theyre going to stop enriching uranium
3379061 it is clear that iran doesnt pay attention to talks iran is a threat not only to israel but this is a global threat
3379062 any kind of hesitation is being perceived by the iranians as weakness
3379063 you dont even give them 15 months necessarily you think its a more urgent matter
3379064 t he world cannot afford a nuclear iran and weapons of mass destruction everywhere in this region in the hands not only of states but also of terrorist organizations
3379065 what happened in the riot is one hundredth of what should happen what will happen
3379066 the kids insult the cops and pretend to be surprised when they get a reaction
3379067 the police have the unfortunate tendency to lump everyone with brown skin into some street gang when in reality most people here study hard and work hard
3379068 there is a real failure to communicate on both sides
3379069 on saturday the cops overreact and shoot three young guys who did nothing wrong on sunday they do nothing while this happens
3379070 i heard my brother say what are you doing to my brother and then i heard gunshots
3379071 my brother tried to help me and now hes dead
3379072 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime

3379076 computers like cats can operate crossdimensionally the trick is in getting them to do what you want
3379077 greece does not have folk music and it does not have folklore
3379078 folk music is by definition irish pop music specifically irish pop music influenced by eastern european dance music
3379079 rave and trance on technical grounds should be classified as classical
3379080 bluegrass is african american actually its origin is french just like rap but it has nothing to do with folk folk is irish pop music concocted in the 50s and 60s which uses instruments that werent invented until the 30s
3379081 wrong the plays of aristophanes prove that the overwhelming majority of athenians were straight and idiogenogamotics were ridiculed as either being effeminate or only doing kologamosis in return for political or financial favours if this was not so then aristophanes would not have mocked the politicians in the front seats as boy fuckers kologamosis with young boys will illegal in ancient athens and those engaging in it were banned from holding elected office or made numerous bum gags or brought naked girls on stage for an all male audience to represent peace or written plays featuring female prostitutes hellenistic romantic fiction such as the aethiopica also disproves your claims that women were only regarded as baby making machines menanders dyskolos also disproves your claims as does book 3 of apollonius argonougtica and euripides hellen kolofilia was nothing more than masturbation just ask yourself why it was only with a man and adolescent boy because it was easier for the giver to think the receiver was a young girl than if it was with a man the same age he might as well have fucked a sheep or a goat so to get back on topic it makes you wonder why rtd made captain jack an omnisexual read complete wanker

3379180 im a gamer and the chance to act in one of the best loved game franchises was an opportunity i was really keen to explore especially as eva is such a strong female character the worlds of gaming and film are getting ever closer and as an actress i wanted to explore this exciting new area of drama broaden my acting skills and continue the active outgoing side of my personality that i showed in im a celebrity
3379181 its great to have gemma on board for such a popular gamers game as command amp conquer red alert 3 we hope that fans of both gemma and the command amp conquer universe will be delighted at what they see when the game goes on sale in october she will also be taking part in ea s be the one event in trafalgar square later this year which forms part of the london games festival
3379182 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3379183 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3379184 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3379185 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3379186 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3379187 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3379188 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3379189 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3379190 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3379191 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
3379192 im really excited about our residents having the opportunity to stay in town and shop locally instead of having to drive 75 miles in either direction to shop at similar stores
3379193 with the anticipated increase in our gross receipts tax revenue our city will be able to participate in federal and state programs that require matching local funds and we can beef up the infrastructure for the entire community including improving our roads presence will also spark additional growth by attracting other businesses to expand or locate here
3379194 our customers will be able to find their favorite brands right in their own neighborhood and at the wal mart price
3379195 with todays gas prices being able to shop close to home offers additional savings to our customers
3379196 we will have a variety of locally grown produce including lettuce onions cabbage pumpkins and chilies
3379197 our store will also offer a selection of wines from new mexico
3379198 we realize that financial support to local organizations helps make a real difference in the community
3379199 we are thrilled to provide these grants as part of our grand opening celebration we will continue to play a leadership role in supporting the needs of t or c and neighboring communities
3379200 working for wal mart provides a number of job opportunities and choices for so many people from seniors looking for supplemental income to young people just starting their work experience
3379201 the new wal mart supercenter provides much needed employment opportunities for area residents and creates an infusion of additional payroll dollars into the local economy we expect that presence will also attract other businesses to our community which will create even more job opportunities for our citizens
3379202 having our own wal mart in avon park is a boon to our residents who absent a public transportation system and with ever rising transportation costs will find it much easier to take care of their shopping needs
3379203 working for wal mart provides a number of job opportunities and choices for so many people from seniors looking for supplemental income to young people just starting their work experience
3379204 we realize that financial support to local organizations helps make a real difference in the community
3379205 we are thrilled to provide these grants as part of our grand opening celebration we will continue to play a leadership role in supporting the needs of avon park and neighboring communities
3379206 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3379207 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3379208 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3379209 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3379210 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3379211 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3379212 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3379213 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3379214 while there was enough on the table there was nothing in my indias plate and it was certainly not sufficient for everyone
3379215 still a possibility to conclude the trade negotiations by end 2008
3379216 it is equally important to ensure a balanced outcome that meets the aspirations of all wto members
3379217 the sole purpose of this buyback is to remove partially the dilution from employee profit sharing

3379222 fios tv is the only service to consider if you want the ultimate hd experience
3379223 with our increased number of hd channels along with hd video on demand programming and our current hd dvr and premium movie promotion were blowing cable away
3379224 the immense capacity of our advanced network means fios tv customers receive hd signals just as verizon receives them with stunning picture and sound quality thats noticeably better delivered on the network thats made for hd
3379225 cost was the driving factor in our decision to deploy the ibm system z9 ec
3379226 weve cut our operating costs significantly while ensuring that the z9 has sufficient processor capability to support winn dixie for years to come the use of the mainframe is integral to our success as we continue getting better all the time
3379227 winn dixie is one of the many system z clients who have told us that the mainframe helps them attack any tco challenge
3379228 the civil hospital at firozepur has an advisory committee it closely monitors all the eight ultrasound centres of the city there are random checks and surprise visits at these hospitals and ultrasound centres not even a single case of female feticide has been found as yet
3379229 pakistan is our neighboring country it has repeatedly tried to frame baseless allegations against india but indian society has a scientific mindset and all this does not affect us anymore indian government is headed by a sikh prime minister and punjab has a sikh chief minister
3379230 we see it as a major competitive advantage to be able to take the spectrum of a hit from hts and compare it against the database of previously elucidated structures
3379231 it gives us the ability to move that lead through the development process much much faster and with far fewer resources
3379232 the combination of search capabilities proton and carbon chemical shift predictors as well as the structure elucidation capabilities meant that there was no hesitation in making this investment our previous experience with acd labs products and service made for a seamless transition in adding additional modules

3379237 plants are dying out at the bottom of their ranges and at the tops of their ranges they seem to be growing in and doing much better
3379238 the only thing that could explain this happening across the entire face of the mountain would be a change in the local climate
3379239 i was surprised by how nice the data looked and how unambiguous the signal was
3379240 it is clear that ecosystems can respond rather rapidly to climate change
3379241 the plants should still be in a recovery phase where they are growing back in
3379242 but they have stopped recovering and now are dying which these plants should not be doing
3379243 many online audio retailers have decided to stock lower quality lower cost audio products over the last three years and consumers have been swayed by these lower prices unfortunately the quality of these units is poor particularly in comparison to the europe top end brands and ultimately consumers appreciate the difference in sound and durability afforded by high quality in car audio systems
3379244 over the next five years we think well see a big shift in consumers switching from lower end import models as their current units begin to fail or fall short of their quality expectations
3379245 high def is hot and fios tv is delivered over the network thats built for hd
3379246 our new offer combines the excitement of premium movies with the convenience and advanced technology of our high def dvrs its a great time for people to experience hd the way its meant to be seen with the sharpness and clarity of fios tv
3379247 what makes this promotion compelling is the fact that it focuses on an increasingly popular feature the dvr in a way that will appeal to both late and early adopters of dvrs
3379248 with this offer consumers who have always wanted a dvr can get one for free for 12 months by moving to fios tv and those that already use a dvr can extend that experience throughout their home at no charge for 12 months by signing up for fios tv and its home media dvr service this is a good example of how a service provider can leverage its technological advantages to attract new business
3379249 when you combine our superior voice video and broadband all delivered on our advanced network with unbeatable packages its clear that cable just cant compete

3379255 nous avons sign une promesse de vente notari e avec une universit de shanghai
3379256 promise grants are designed to bring the worlds best minds together people who might not ordinarily collaborate and to provide those experts with the resources to focus and solve one serious problem in breast cancer and to get results to patients quickly
3379257 we are addressing the large gap in funding for this kind of research and we are addressing it in a big way
3379258 american was quick to recognize with us that substantial amounts of funding are needed now to research and halt inflammatory breast cancer through this first promise grant american is making a critical investment in comprehensive treatment for this rare disease
3379259 these airplanes will be a visible reminder virtually everywhere of the work still left to do in the breast cancer fight
3379260 the employees of american airlines and american eagle are very proud to support susan g komen for the cure
3379261 while tremendous strides have been made in the overall treatment of breast cancer until now theres been very little research into this rare disease that behaves so differently than other breast cancers
3379262 the global cancer community will stand to benefit from our comprehensive research program and what we learn about this disease the only way to achieve better outcomes for women with the disease is to have dedicated resources such as the funds allocated by komen and american airlines for continued ibc research

3379264 integrating arts into the education of our young students early in their development will have a profound effect on their future learning not only in the arts but in all areas including math sciences and language
3379265 art education is essential to the success of children as individuals and as citizens but no single group can bring quality art teaching programs to utah schools we all have to work together
3379266 we are delighted that the university of utah has dedicated its tremendous resources to establishing this new center to integrate education with the arts and enrich the lives of utah children
3379267 we share the vision of improving the quality of life for utahs young people by providing each one with the best possible arts education
3379268 we are honored our efforts will continue beverley sorensons work and carry her name
3379269 the arts can profoundly change childrens lives and is a critical tool for improving student achievement

3379272 handbags can change your whole look and transform a plain outfit into one thats set to impress
3379273 often women buy a new handbag to suit a certain outfit and dont want to throw it away after just one use so keep hold of it to use again one day
3379274 its clear from the results of this research that british women have some sort of handbag obsession
3379275 maggie thatcher started the trend with her love for handbags and todays celebrities such as sienna miller lindsay lohan and nicole richie have followed in her footsteps so much so that i like to call this handbag obsession sienna miller syndrome

3379290 i immediately worked my body differently as soon as i had curves i was like i want to stick my butt out show my cleavage i immediately felt sexy i dont feel sexy on a daily basis in fact i never feel sexy
3379291 truthfully ive never seen myself as being too thin sometimes ill look at photos and be like oh thats not a good look but generally speaking im not too thin
3379292 contradictory or maybe just tall for a dwarf will the reader understand my intent ah
3379293 having recently discovered that his pants were on fire the bearded dwarf ran into the swamp
3379294 now thats something of which even joyce may have been proud first the discovery then the reaction we have conflict action and reaction and dare i say the makings of a plot must expand on the swamp a bit however must lure the reader into my setting
3379295 having recently discovered that his pants were on fire the bearded dwarf ran into the swamp which was wet dark scary full of slimy creatures and about 15 miles southwest of tallahassee
3379296 now if i can just keep the momentum rolling as i ratchet up the suspense and introduce the antagonist
3379297 the bearded dwarf who was named stubs soon lost his way in the wet dark and scary swamp suddenly and without warning there was a rustling sound that came from a nearby stand of bull rushes that was only about three feet away
3379298 when this is made into a movie itll definitely be pg 13 for intense scenarios
3379299 who are you what are you doing here what is your connection to the story did you know that youre standing on quicksand
3379300 my name is tony and i am here to antagonize you no i did not realize that im standing on quicksand but now that you have mentioned it i shall move aside better
3379301 you can see by my kind warning to you the enemy that i am the hero of this story i stand for all that is right and good you represent all the crappy qualities that exist in the world
3379302 one year you spent the entire christmas season telling children that santas home melted due to global warming you married an irish girl just so you could divorce her on saint patricks day
3379303 i also watch slasher movies so i can cheer for the killer
3379304 but i am here to put an end to your evil ways
3379305 hevil hevil hevil what are you going to do sic your beard on me
3379306 except i happen to know of something that makes you quiver in fear something that will make you helpless with terror so that i may drag you to justice
3379307 you shall hang from the tallest yard arm in the jungle
3379308 my minions will cook you upon a spit and season you with cinnamon with just a hint of basil
3379309 i heard you scream in agony i thought something might be wrong
3379310 i shall run right out and get some more granola for our little lair

3379315 why wasnt i called off are we getting more patients today
3379316 well i just thought you could stay and help with baths then you can go home
3379317 first of all i want to thank all my supporters mario and sonic
3379318 you will drive around the block six times trying to find one of those dollar an hour spaces so those on street spaces really need to be more competitive with off street parking rates in order to get some of those folks off the streets and into garages
3379319 so the idea is to make those metered spots look less tempting and garages more financially appealing i will ask the parking authority whose garages are in the public realm to lower their short term rates as part of this and see if we can actually prove its a viable alternative
3379320 if we can successfully have a vibrant clean safe and efficient transit system that starts to address a lot of things in the city
3379321 joe caseys success and septas success ensures the mayors success
3379322 so the idea is to make those metered spots look less tempting and garages more financially appealing i will ask the parking authority whose garages are in the public realm to lower their short term rates as part of this and see if we can actually prove its a viable alternative
3379323 were still trying to identify those young guys and letting them roll lappano said
3379324 well do that a couple of more days and around friday well have to say that we are looking for seven receivers and four running backs and the rest of them thats just the way it is
3379325 some of them are doing pretty good some of them are struggling a little bit he said
3379326 but this happens every year so they make plays when they know what they are doing some of them make some really nice plays that make you go wow they are pretty good
3379327 i asked them if anyone was scared and wanted to go home today and they said no everybody looks good in their laundry meaning before pads are on but they seem not to shy away from contact
3379328 we just need to make sure that thing is as stable as it needs to be before we step on the gas he said
3379329 we dont want to go too far too fast we still have three weeks before we have to play football
3379330 before that decision gets made hes going to have to show me that he can go full speed and not limp around or not have any soreness denbrock said
3379331 because the last thing we are going to do is put him in jeopardy or re injuring that
3379332 sleep deprivation sexual humiliation sensory disorientation and the imposition of physical and psychological pain
3379333 they couldnt say that we broke the rules because there were no rules
3379334 so over time you become numb to it and its nothing

3379344 the opportunity will be here for him to return once his family issues have been resolved said willingham for the time being that needs to be his focus
3379345 long term situation and he is not expected back any time soon
3379346 the first thing is we dont have strings meaning a first string or second string on the defensive line he said
3379347 its how many guys can we get up to the level of playing the game to play
3379348 if i could take 10 snaps from him it would be a wonderful thing donatell said
3379349 my goal would be to rest him more this year then hell be more effective because he plays so hard the key is to get another guy in there who can play a couple of snaps so he can get over there and get rested and then win a third down thats my wish and my intentions

3379375 he sido condenado y he sufrido una especie de lapidaci n p blica de encarnizamiento medi tico que ha dado por hechos probados lo que en realidad son sorprendentes acusaciones que no han sido ni ser n probadas ya que se trata de hechos que nunca han existido
3379376 tengo la ntima convicci n de no haber cometido delito alguno en toda mi vida tambi n lo saben quienes me conocen en forma cercana pero a todas aquellas personas que me conocen en forma menos directa les digo que yo soy como siempre me vieron
3379377 no tengo nada que ver con esa especie de monstruo que han inventado los medios
3379378 i havent learned a whole lot from these statements but every time one of them mentions the u n is a place to go i think that is a waste of time to be honest i havent been real impressed with what either of these candidates have said but theyre just the candidates theres not much they can do here is what i was struck by that mccain said though in a statement world history is often made in remote obscure countries this is mccains advantage here he used his statement today mccain did to show he understands the sweep of history something obama has not yet done
3379379 one of the real challenges we have in the 21st century is holding a country like russia thats now invaded an emerging democracy that had free elections how do you hold them accountable until they are more accountable to the rules that civilized countries play by be they military diplomatic or economic i dont think its necessarily being combative to suggest that unless their conduct complies with a certain norm that there has to be consequences
3379380 no because the reality is this is president bush s job he is the president the candidates all they could simply do is make statements they arent involved in any kind of negotiations
3379381 this is a problem that senator obama faces on a number of issues not just this one to the extent that he wants to try and take a more nuanced approach appreciate all of the complexities of a difficult issue because he doesnt reflexively want to resort to force or to draw lines that the u s wouldnt be able to defend anyway hes always open to the charge of being weak certainly senator mccain would try to make that point
3379382 well my gut tells me that had this come out before the iowa caucus senator clinton would have done better in the iowa caucus and the result would have been different you know i think there are a lot of different ways you can play the what if game i think for instance that if senator clinton hadnt teared up in new hampshire barack obama would have won new hampshire and he would have been the nominee in january so you can play this 50 different ways
3379383 i dont think its true i think its a lot of lamenting thats going on its not helpful and its a little bit irrelevant its like saying if senator obama hadnt run she would be the nominee or if we had run under the republican party rules she would be the nominee maybe but you know what none of that stuff happened theres not even the point to really talking about it
3379384 this is one of those coulda shoulda wouldas that hillary clinton said that the clinton campaign should not do having lost and you know you come less three weeks before the convention when unity is the big deal its just not helpful
3379385 i went and looked at some of the returns by county and i do think theres an argument to be made that obama tended to do better in the college counties and edwards tended to do better in the sort of blue collar urban counties im not certain i buy that if edwards were not in the race clinton would have won because that would require two out of every three edwards supporters to have supported her but i do think you could make the argument and make it a credible one that the race would have been much closer
3379386 nowadays theres so much information in politics we can actually go back and look at exit polls who was your second choice the second choice of edwards voters was obama those voters would have gone to obama they would not have gone to hillary clinton so what howard wolfson said is untrue
3379387 except where payments are self executing under the california constitution the state has no authority to pay state employees their full salaries where it does not have an appropriation such as in this case where there is no budget for fiscal year 2008 2009
3379388 the governor has created a solution to a problem that does not exist
3379389 rather than focus on building consensus for a budget that addresses california s long term fiscal problems the governor seems adamant on picking a fight over whether state employees are entitled to the wages they have worked for and earned

3379557 new yorks public drinking water is of high quality but keeping unused drugs out of our waters helps to maintain or improve that quality
3379558 hospitals and other institutions can also help with these efforts
3379559 the state education department recognizes this emerging environmental problem and is working with the dec to address the proper disposal of drugs
3379560 the education department with the advice of its board of pharmacy and the pharmaceutical community that it regulates will continue to study why so many dispensed drugs go unused and to determine appropriate strategies to insure that new yorkers and their environment are protected

3379584 rural northumberland has the most sparsely populated areas in england and we believe post office closures would have a significant impact upon our communities
3379585 we remain concerned that the time the post office has allowed for consultation is too short to allow communities to respond fully and for alternative proposals to be considered appropriately
3379586 the county council has registered its concerns with the post office about possible closures in support of the communities potentially affected the elderly and those with young families who are least able to adjust to the proposed changes
3379587 we are urging post office ltd to recognise the special circumstances in northumberland and continue to work with us and our communities to consider alternative options

3379613 despu s de una reuni n en paso de la patria se acord descartar de manera absoluta alg n tipo de medidas de fuerza durante la realizaci n de la fiesta nacional de la pesca del dorado
3379614 hablamos con el ministro de producci n y se responsabiliz de que el gobierno disponga de la medida el gobierno provincial se comprometi a dictar la normativa de flexibilizaci n que dispone el permiso para capturar un dorado
3379615 nosotros apoyamos la pesca y devoluci n y con la flexibilizaci n de esta medida que fue consensuada con los intendentes de la provincia esperamos que ahora se confirme por parte del gobierno
3379616 los gu as de pesca estaban reclamando diche flexibilizaci n de la normativa que restringe la pesca del dorado y ante el compromiso de ponerlo en pr ctica se descart el bloque de acceso a la localidad
3379617 esperamos q esto aumente son 240 equipos que ser an 750 concursantes lo m s importante es la procedencia ya que el 90 no son pescadores de la provincia sino de distintos lugares del pa s como buenos aires c rdoba mendoza salta jujuy en donde hicimos promoci n durante todo este a o y el resultado se ve en las inscripciones tambi n contaremos con la presencia de pescadores de uruguay brasil y paraguay ello muestra la calidad del concurso el porcentaje de gente de afuera no es un dato menor
3379618 cuando se habla de la pesca deportiva de corrientes el sello principal es el dorado y por tanto paso de la patria toda esta normativa de protecci n de los recursos se centra en el dorado ya que sigue siendo una de las especies de mayor riqueza para la pesca deportiva el pescador deportivo busca el dorado y ese es un sello distintivo de la provincia y destacado en el pa s por eso al dorado hay que potenciarlo y cuidarlo en beneficio de la provincia

3379620 when i first saw the copies being sold they actually had the princess of wales name attached to it so i went into one of their stores and explained that they were selling these items erroneously
3379621 the salesman apologised and said they would be removed from sale but they just carried on selling it without the diana name lochcarron wrote them a letter again asking them to withdraw it from sale but again they ignored it
3379622 i saw it on sale on the royal mile as early as a month ago whenever ive tried to contact them theyve just shrugged their shoulders and declined to talk
3379623 weve got to see some significant improvements over the next couple of years

3379625 a film is a very specific and personal account of bill carters experience in sarajevo during the war and we would very much like to make the film here
3379626 this is a departure from the very big hollywood productions
3379627 im not in fact playing bill in this movie but i read the script and the very human story at the very core of this film spoke to me very clearly
3379628 hopefully we can get this movie to be made at the end of this year to come here and shoot would be just wonderful
3379629 it is ever more urgent that we investigate the possibility of a long term solution in the form of a new and more eco friendly international airport

3379638 with the approval of the rggi regulations today we have enacted a key component of governor david a patersons plan to move new york towards a clean energy economy and ensure a healthier environment for our entire region
3379639 governor paterson has made fighting global climate change one of the hallmarks of his comprehensive energy policy
3379640 as rggi funds become available from the auctions we look forward to working with our partners to develop new technologies and implement energy efficiency programs that will reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases and provide real and lasting energy savings for consumers throughout new york state
3379641 the environmental boards approval of regulations designed to implement the nations first carbon cap and trade program is a landmark step for new york state
3379642 by taking this bold and innovative action the board is helping turn governor patersons vision of a clean energy economy into reality

3379663 the graduation rate is a crucial indicator of whether our school system is fulfilling its core mission giving our children the skills they need to become successful adults
3379664 after a decade of near stagnation new york citys graduation rate has climbed significantly since 2002 we clearly need to help larger numbers of students to graduate but the progress weve made so far means that thousands more students are graduating today than would have six years ago
3379665 todays numbers confirm once again that steady progress is now the rule not the exception in new york citys public schools
3379666 although im pleased that the overall graduation rate is continuing to rise its especially encouraging to see that the biggest increases are among our black and hispanic students this is further evidence that were beginning to close the shameful racial achievement gap in this city
3379667 today is a day to congratulate teachers principals students and parents for all their hard work in keeping the graduation rate going in the right direction
3379668 tomorrow we must ask ourselves what more can we do to get our kids ready for college to enter the workforce to improve their life skills thats going to require continued collaboration by everyone with a stake in our kids education and in so doing we will dramatically increase the graduation rates
3379669 we are seeing gradual steady increases in student graduation rates because school leaders teachers and parents are truly working together to improve student learning and ensure every child receives a quality education
3379670 student achievement has always been a priority for school leaders and while there is still more work to be done with the proper resources we will continue to make progress

3379683 i now live in the washington dc metro area and i am a senior executive with the federal government i have had extensive experience with the media over the years but nothing compares to the vilification and lies i have been subjected by the likes of the new york times los angeles times the new republic vanity fair and even national geographic

3379692 the proposed regulations are an absolute disaster for the nations endangered species
3379693 secretary kempthorne seems determined to establish a legacy of environmental destruction and extinction and surpass even james watt as the most anti environmental interior secretary in u s history
3379694 these regulations are a recipe for extinction for endangered species
3379695 its a classic example of letting the fox guard the henhouse and would allow thousands of projects that harm endangered species to move forward without mitigation
3379696 joint counterpart regulations for consultation under section 7 of the endangered species act to streamline consultation on proposed projects that support the national fire plan nfp
3379697 having suppressed all evidence that self consultation does not work the bush administration is now attempting to expand the program rather than publicly acknowledge that it is a failure
3379698 the very existence of these proposed regulations shows that the endangered species act currently requires federal agencies to consider the impact of their greenhouse emissions on the polar bear and the administration knows it
3379699 rather than comply with the law the administration is instead trying to change it such changes are illegal and would leave dead polar bears in their wake
3379700 the administration has finally admitted that greenhouse gas emissions are driving species like the polar bear to extinction yet they are doing everything in their power to ensure that these emissions are not regulated or reduced
3379701 a rushed and premature return process would have disastrous consequences both for the displaced and for the stability of iraq
3379702 violence is still widespread and basic services such as access to healthcare clean water or adequate shelter are unavailable in many parts of the country
3379703 since last year weve managed to achieve remarkable security gains this should help iraqi displaced families and refugees to return to their homes and lead normal lives
3379704 i ran out of money to feed my family and meet their needs and it was hard to find decent work there because of my legal status and that is why we came to the conclusion that it would be better to return to iraq despite the fragile security here
3379705 until conditions are met for a voluntary safe and sustainable return process
3379706 kids today have been given everything they want and dont have to work for it they have no respect for authority

3379713 i look forward to working with the staff of mtas and all of ips to assist the leadership of tennessee cities as they continue to strive for the most efficient and effective ways of enhancing the quality of services they provide to their citizens

3379719 while flood waters have receded and many flood victims have been able to resume a normal life we cant forget those who were displaced from their homes by the storms
3379720 having a safe comfortable home to live in will help families with the long term recovery process
3379721 its important that the media has a chance to see close up how some of the victims of the storms and flooding from june 1 to july 22 will live
3379722 a mobile home may be the best situation for them when they have no other options

3379724 there are use cases we are looking at supporting some are working today dashboard builder for example lets you lasso crystal reports content and drag and drop it into a dashboard you can add xcelsius components and even web intelligence docs
3379725 going forward we are looking at things like moving a web intelligence query into voyager for slicing and dicing work sets from polestar into web intelligence for someone else other then the casual information user to then create scheduled reports for publishing et cetera
3379726 the fire was about a mile away from florence and covered 1 500 acres and was threatening the pecan ranch subdivision when the state asked for assistance
3379727 fires like this show how critical it is for firefighters to receive the support they need to protect the public
3379728 archaeological evidence at the site suggests the inland fish traps on piastre station were occupied between 200 and 5000 years ago
3379729 a degraded sand dune discovered close to the fish traps also shows evidence of extended occupation of the area by aboriginal people
3379730 and there are numerous artefacts that required protection along with the fish traps
3379731 a search of the aboriginal cultural heritage database shows the piastre fish traps are one of just 20 recorded inland fish trap sites
3379732 that makes this site one of tremendous cultural heritage significance which will now be protected for future generations of queenslanders
3379733 this plan will guarantee access for traditional owners to the site formalise how the 20 hectare site will be managed in the future and ensure ongoing protection of the cultural heritage on the site
3379734 i anticipate the experience involved in progressing this agreement may become a template for other similar efforts to protect queenslands unique cultural heritage
3379735 in particular i want to thank the mardigan people who have agreed to share the cultural wealth of this site with the wider community
3379736 i also pay tribute to the tully family who recognised the significance of the site and actively looked for a process to hand this parcel of land back to the traditional owners
3379737 the commonwealth also provided funds through south west nrm for strategically placed alternative water sources so that stock was diverted away from this section of manu manu creek
3379738 this is an example of governments working with community groups to protect our cultural heritage for future generations
3379739 it demonstrates the benefits of good relationships between aboriginal traditional owners and landholders
3379740 it also highlights how the management and protection of indigenous cultural heritage can be a shared responsibility
3379741 i think people are looking at last season but its gone it was a one off season
3379742 you cant help it if there are certain people who dont know anything about football but there is only one way to answer to those critics
3379743 i spoke to sone at the weekend and he told me his decision
3379744 we have decided not to link the payment of his fine with his selection
3379745 im not saying he won but the judges were very generous to the chinese it was absolutely stupid
3379746 you expect a slight bias but they gave the chinese guy a point for everything you expect a level playing field
3379747 he has played regularly at the top level for eight seasons and im sure that his style of play will be a big plus for us
3379748 he is a good character and a really creative strong running back rower with plenty of pace a good step and he is a proven line breaker
3379749 we have checked those and there are no reports of any impact to any of the pipelines
3379750 weve got some good young players and we will give them a go but we need to get that understanding of what we are doing
3379751 we need a bit more playing time i might go with the same team i played against palace
3379752 we have spent some money and weve spent on some good players
3379753 the mix of players who were here already and the new signings put us in a good position to do well
3379754 nicky maynard will be in double figures for goals come the end of the season i dont doubt that for one moment
3379755 i want my strikers to get themselves in dangerous positions and to pose a threat in the penalty area
3379756 although he had a bit of a quiet game nicky still did that and on another day could easily have had a couple of goals
3379757 with hunger on the rise we are doing our best to stream incoming contributions to the people most in need in africa asia and the caribbean
3379758 it is essential to launch a bold new set of responses to stem a full blown hunger and nutritional crisis
3379759 food prices are not abating and the worlds most vulnerable have exhausted their coping strategies
3379760 our action plan is targeted and customized to help the most vulnerable meet their urgent needs
3379761 hes going to bring something very special to the team
3379762 dominic cork has been a great ambassador for lancashire both on and off the field and is fully committed to finishing the championship season with the club
3379763 this decision was made with the longer term development of the playing staff in mind and to allow the side to evolve providing younger players the opportunity to grow into the team
3379764 lancashire will support dominic in every way to help him extend his cricketing career past this season
3379765 i dont think it could happen to a greater rugby player
3379766 the professional player that he is now and the experience he brings to the side is extraordinary even when hes not playing hes the same player and the same character
3379767 this week is going to be huge for him but percy knows that the job is more important than the milestone
3379768 after hearing the reports i knew it must have been her but when finally confirmed it was still shocking eisele said
3379769 every conversation ive had with our mutual friends has been that way we are deeply saddened
3379770 the other climber was my sister carolyn she was 57 on august 7 she was an incredible mom grandmom sister and human being she was such an incredibly smart beautiful and courageous woman she will be missed greatly i cannot explain how we feel right now god bless cindy
3379771 shes an accomplished mountaineer who was very safe and very thorough said eisele who met randall three years ago through the colorado mountain club
3379772 i dont know details of what happened but i imagine weather conditions had something to do with it
3379773 she was very upbeat and energetic and always a joy to be with dean said
3379774 she was passionate about climbing and didnt want to live anywhere else but colorado this is the place she always wanted to be so she could do these sorts of things
3379775 id like to stay healthy enough to do outdoor activities with my grandchildren id also like to make sure that ive lived a full life up to now i think i have ive been to a lot of places and seen a lot of good and bad
3379776 it takes great hubris to resurrect an issue the court has already definitely struck down
3379777 this is like a zombie movie their proposal to toss the endangered species act over the cliff died but now has somehow come back to life
3379778 the bush cheney administration is looking back over the last eight years to see what real benefits theyve brought to those who favor short term gain over our environment they have little to show due to vigilance by conservation fishing and hunting groups who have worked to hold the line nonetheless theyre trying again to leave favors for powerful friends before leaving office
3379779 i have got a lot of players who have been in really good form in pre season who didnt play at the weekend and who are looking for an opportunity to play
3379780 of course i could do with a bit more time but ill just go in and give it a go thats a hundred times better than watching on tv
3379781 giving children an education in conservation has been extremely important for addressing the problems in the tahoe basin after all they are the generation that will inherit tahoe
3379782 normally we can only monitor a few sites at a time
3379783 now we can measure the shaking at each site five dozen of them
3379784 the publics participation will contribute to an enormous package of data
3379785 this kind of partnership between scientists and the community isnt going on anywhere in the world
3379786 the governor could not be more wrong with regard to the need for this lawsuit and his understanding of the consequences
3379787 taxpayers and public servants alike need to know that the governor has created a solution to a problem that does not exist
3379788 rather than focus on building consensus for a budget that addresses californias long term fiscal problems the governor seems adamant on picking a fight over whether state employees are entitled to the wages they have worked for and earned
3379789 the governors executive order has cost too many state employees their jobs and has in turn delivered a blow to our already fragile economy turning to the courts to help him run the state without a budget is nothing more than a distraction from badly needed budget reforms and is the absolute wrong playbook for the state although i will continue to fight to pay public servants their full wages it is unfortunate that taxpayers will now have to foot the bill for this governors reckless and unnecessary legal battle we should be focusing on fixing our long term budget needs
3379790 we are delighted to have bill join our team here at cmark international
3379791 bill will be key to working with the capital markets to attract new investors and secure finances to fund our new planned growth strategy
3379792 in addition with the growth the company has experienced having all of our accounting and corporate finance functions strategically located in one office with this level of management expertise should provide the company the necessary financial resources to properly grow the company in a public environment it also allows our other offices throughout the country to focus on business development and project management
3379793 even in the face of the darkest nights justice will ultimately prevail
3379794 represent major potential for consolidation of canadas construction and renovation market especially through recruitment of independent stores
3379795 we are all worried it was a military regime maaouya ould taya government that pushed us out and now its another military takeover we were promised by the president abdallahi that we would be treated equally that we are all mauritanians
3379796 in recent months sidi ould cheikh abdallahi has made overtures to islamist groups and brokered power exchanges with ould tayas previous ministers if this coup had not happened a return to power from ould taya would have been inevitable

3379800 combating climate change is one of the worlds most urgent challenges and it will be increasingly crucial for the next generation to learn how to address it
3379801 i am elated to see these bright and motivated students ready to lead their peers and communities to find local solutions to this global crisis engaging the youth to take on leadership roles is an important way to solve the climate change problem before it is too late
3379802 it is inspiring to see a top california scientist engaging with young californians on one of the biggest issues facing our state climate change
3379803 it is especially exciting to see dr ramanathan working with the students while he is earning global praise for his work at the beijing olympics
3379804 i am delighted that climate champions from the united states and canada had the honor and opportunity to learn from dr ramanathan today
3379805 the students will be able to apply his teachings as they become leaders in communicating climate change to their communities
3379806 according to most studies we have looked at the middle class around the world will have at least a terabyte thats 1 000 gigabytes in their homes in the next two to three years
3379807 the correlation of media home network installations and household income is uncanny
3379808 nearly all other demographic factors pale by comparison there is one other key characteristic of the home network consumer they have kids
3379809 there are still quite clearly job opportunities in pharmaceuticals medical devices environmental engineering as well as demand for process and product engineers
3379810 and with this survey showing salary scales in a number of engineering categories continuing to increase we would strongly advocate those considering career options to look at the lucrative and diverse possibilities the engineering industry can offer them

3379822 a british rate cut within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3379823 the largest upward pressure in july came from food and non alcoholic beverages where prices rose this year but fell a year ago
3379824 within this division there were large upward effects from meat bread and cereals and vegetables
3379825 this is a really disturbing set of data that will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3379826 the rise in consumer price inflation to a series high of 4 4 percent in july was well above expectations
3379827 although it is difficult for the mpc to consider rate cuts while inflation is still rising it should not hesitate to cut rates later
3379828 to go significantly higher still over the coming months despite the recent retreat in oil prices
3379829 in california 22 neighborhoods cities towns and counties of all sizes have taken the steps to becoming designated preserve america communities
3379830 i am delighted to be here today at the beautiful stanford mansion in sacramento to recognize the importance of heritage tourism preservation and the lessons of history that are made authentic and accessible through those efforts made by sacramento
3379831 sacramento is honored to be designated as a preserve america community
3379832 this designation recognizes sacramentos efforts to preserve its rich and diverse heritage it will help to enhance sacramentos heritage tourism programs in collaboration with our partners california state parks the california cultural heritage tourism council and the sacramento convention amp visitors bureau among others on behalf of the city i thank first lady laura bush deputy secretary of the department of the interior lynn scarlett and the advisory council on historic preservation for their recognition of sacramento as a preserve america community

3379851 claramente tenemos confianza en nuestras fuerzas y contamos con la calidad necesaria para tratar de ganar cada partido aunque uno nunca sabe lo que puede suceder en cualquier competencia
3379852 no one from the afl has spoken to us about it which is a surprise

3379858 the strategic partnership with the dubai mercantile exchange is consistent with our commitment to the region
3379859 not only offers strong potential from an investment perspective but also constitutes a strategic partnership that will develop our footprint in the middle east
3379860 a successful and liquid futures exchange linked to energy products in the region will help us to better manage some of the risks inherent in our own business and those of our clients we believe that the ongoing economic growth and development in dubai and wider gcc region will continue to drive the success of the dme delivering return on investment as well as enhanced opportunities for our global client base
3379861 it was a difficult decision one that we have seldom had to take before and one that we hope not to have to take again
3379862 i just think publishers should uphold the principle of free speech editorial judgement is very important but free speech is sacred without it we should give up and go home
3379863 we stand firmly by our responsibility to support our authors and the free discussion of ideas even those that may be construed as offensive by some however a publisher must weigh that responsibility against others that it also bears and in this instance we decided after much deliberation to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
3379864 as a publisher im a big advocate of search inside not least because it encourages sales and increases the visibility of writers whose books we believe in
3379865 this will close off the north end of our property and screen our neighbors to the north from our operations

3379867 seethroughny is designed to become the hub of a statewide network through which taxpayers can share analyze and compare data from local governments and school districts throughout new york
3379868 we pay them we have a right to know what we pay them
3379869 and with the knowledge which seethroughny allows new yorkers to marshal power can be exercised by the people to help government perform effectively and efficiently
3379870 lifts the veil of secrecy that too often covers government spending in new york
3379871 the information on this website is especially valuable at a time of fiscal crisis when tough choices need to be made and every tax dollar should be spent wisely and efficiently
3379872 who wants to have their salaries revealed to the world
3379873 so much of what the empire center does is about denigrating public service
3379874 the disclosure of this information and the ease of access to the information has ramifications regarding the personal safety of the individuals in the database
3379875 there has been at least one instance brought to our attention where a co worker of a member was living in a shelter for battered women and her estranged husband was able to identify her work location through the website and is now stalking her at her work site
3379876 ultimately theyre challenging the freedom of information law this doesnt say where people live if the objection is now youve invaded my privacy and people can find me well ive got news for you were all pretty easy to find and its everyones business what you make if you work for the government
3379877 we learned from that mistake and we proved that we learned from that mistake based on our performance in the last four elections
3379878 since he took office martin omalley has used the maryland department of transportation for flashy environmental promises instead of providing core service to maryland travelers
3379879 the states marc train service is breaking down buses are being recalled and maryland drivers are still mired in horrific traffic jams on the states highways
3379880 marylands mass transit systems are breaking down despite the governors campaign promise to make mass transit a priority this comes at a time when marylanders are turning to marc trains and mta buses more and more to get to work clearly this record of failure indicates a need for change in 2010

3379888 ever since charles darwins discovery of giant ground sloth remains in south america debate has ensued about the cause of early extinction of the worlds megafauna now 150 years on from the publication of darwins seminal work the origin of species the argument for climate change being the cause of this mass extinction has been seriously undermined it is sad to know that our ancestors played such a major role in the extinction of these species and sadder still when we consider that this trend continues today
3379889 island environments offer an excellent test of competing hypotheses they typically have a similar megafauna and climate to neighbouring continental landmasses but human arrival was often delayed
3379890 the tasmanian results echo those on mainland australia putting humans squarely back in the frame as the driving force behind megafaunal extinction
3379891 the skeletal remains provide key evidence of tasmanias final megafauna in the dim if not too distant past

3379893 for these wild chilies the biggest danger to the seed comes before dispersal when a large number are killed by this fungus
3379894 both the fungus and the birds eat chilies but the fungus never disperses seeds it just kills them
3379895 capsaicin doesnt stop the dispersal of seeds because birds dont sense the pain and so they continue to eat peppers but the fungus that kills pepper seeds is quite sensitive to this chemical
3379896 having such a specific defense one that doesnt harm reproduction or dispersal is what makes chemistry so valuable to the plant and i think it is a great example of the power of natural selection
3379897 by contrast peppers increase their chemical defense levels or their heat as they ripen this is a very different model and peppers can get away with it because birds dont sense pain when they eat capsaicin
3379898 i think a lot of plants would love to come up with this way of stopping fungal growth without inhibiting dispersers its just very hard to do
3379899 before there was refrigeration it was probably adaptive to eat chilies particularly in the tropics
3379900 back then if you lived in a warm and humid climate eating could be downright dangerous because virtually everything was packed with microbes many of them harmful people probably added chilies to their stews because spicy stews were less likely to kill them
3379901 in the north any adaptive benefit to using eating chilies would be much smaller than at the equator because microbial infection of food is less common and its easier to keep food cold maybe thats why food in the north can be so boring
3379902 along the equator without access to refrigeration you could be dead pretty quickly unless you can find a way to protect yourself against the microbes you ingest every day
3379903 this show will be a great experience for both motorcycle enthusiasts and the general public for nearly a century the motorcycle has been an icon for innovation in design and engineering it has come to symbolize the concept of freedom which has been an engine of creativity in design its about the edge of wildness that lurks within and can break out with a motorcycle designed to liberate our wilder side

3379933 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3379934 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3379935 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3379936 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3379937 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3379938 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3379939 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3379940 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
3379941 pregunt a mucha gente y me dijeron que era bueno pero ten a que serlo si gan a murray
3379942 it is definitely a difficult one but one well look to do well in
3379943 whether its one of the new boys coming up or an established premier league team especially first up
3379944 weve added good quality to the squad and im sure the competition for places is a lot stronger now than it was at the start of last season
3379945 its about cutting through the gordian knot of food feed and fuel
3379946 the whole exercise was to make sure that the mill would remain open even though we all know its going to come with tough and bold measures because we cannot operate the way it is now
3379947 that significant investment is anywhere from 60 million to 150 million just depends on who youre talking to
3379948 if you look at the whole industry its obvious that even a corporation the size of ours doesnt have the liquidity to deal with such big numbers
3379949 understanding how elephants and other animal populations react to droughts will be a central component of wildlife management and conservation
3379950 our findings seem to support the hypothesis that older females with knowledge of distant resources become crucial to the survival of herds during periods of extreme climatic events
3379951 climate change is expected to lead to a higher occurrence of severe drought in africa and our study suggests that such extreme climatic events may act as a selection force on animal populations as animals battle to cope certain individuals such as these grand dames of the elephant kingdom might become increasingly important
3379952 its enticing to think that these old females and their memories of previous periods of trauma and survival would have meant all the difference
3379953 the data seem to support the speculation that the matriarchs with the necessary experience of such events were able to lead their groups to drought refugia
3379954 hopefully this study underlines the importance of how crucial older matriarchs are to the health of elephant populations
3379955 protecting the leaders of elephant herds will be even more important in what may be an increase in droughts due to climate change
3379956 its a great honor and privilege to be selected by my colleagues to be chair of this committee

3379962 lin miaoke was the best in this and yang peiyis voice was the most outstanding
3379963 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3379964 why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
3379965 i can understand why they picked the prettier girl they need to maintain a certain aesthetic beauty during the opening ceremonies this situation is not so bad especially since it gives two people an opportunity to shine rather than just one

3379976 gary fifteen years later and youre still to the rescue more acute and heroic than ever
3379977 gary miller who started kvm and is as good a blogger as exists has not wavered in his criticism of zogbys methodology
3379978 despite the fact that you have taken a few petty and gratuitous shots at me i want to quote your web site great point on the federalist papers
3379979 smart folks are already following kennedy vs the machine for news of that us senate race
3379980 new local blogs for candidates have cropped up drawing national sized audiences like kennedy vs the machine
3379981 minnesotas conservative blog community spawned kennedy vs the machine which pushes senate candidate mark kennedy by bashing state and national democrats
3379982 from national issues to state issues to fun facts that help to personalize public figures kvm informs and educates in an insightful and often amusing way
3379983 miller as you can tell by the name of his blog is a party sycophant
