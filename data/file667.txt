6670021 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6670022 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6670023 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6670024 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6670025 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6670026 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6670027 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6670028 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6670029 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6670030 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6670031 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6670032 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6670033 the two parties signed an agreement that said the judges will be restored within 24 hours of musharrafs impeachment
6670034 we honestly and sincerely want the coalition to work but the restoration of the judges was the central issue in our election campaign and if that is not respected then people will ask why are we clinging on to the coalition
6670035 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6670036 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6670037 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6670038 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6670039 they have defaulted on their promise three times and its putting us in an awkward position
6670040 the judges restoration issue is not as simple as mr sharif thinks
6670041 in the past they the government have sat in the drawing rooms making big decisions we want to do it through the parliamentary process
6670042 yes i am in a bad mood no it is nothing to do with you yes i will get over it understand good lets go on with the lesson

6670053 california is the nations biggest consumer of gasoline 45 million gallons a day plus 10 million gallons of diesel that makes us the third biggest petroleum consuming entity in the world behind on the united states and china so theres a gusher of hypocrisy here the state that is the biggest consumer of gasoline in the nation but produces less than 40 of what it uses is opposed to drilling for more oil off its shores were slackers not pulling our weight

6670055 at least 65 of americas undiscovered recoverable oil and 40 of its natural gas is hostage to the congressional drilling moratorium the democratic leadership is trying to smother any awareness of their responsibility for high prices they are also trying to quash a revolt among democrats who realize that the country is still dependent on fossil fuels no matter how loudly quasimystical environmentalists like al gore claim otherwise
6670056 the american energy tour was very important because we were able to look at both short term and the long term solutions to the national energy crisis we were able to research a lot of proposed solutions to the crisis at both the national renewable energy lab nrel and in alaska at nrel we saw what the future will be of energy in this country although we are continuing to explore renewable sources of energy frankly the alternatives are not commercially viable right now that is why we need to adopt an all of the above policy while we look at the long term solutions with renewable and alternative sources of energy we must immediately address the short term national crisis that is a supply and demand problem we have policies that are prohibiting us from exploring our own natural resources we are in this predicament because the liberal leadership in congress has their heads in the sand and continues to block legislation that will lower gas prices ive seen first hand that we have the technology to drill safely and increase the supply of american oil to bring down the price of gas the time for congress to act is now

6670059 democratic leaders caught off guard by a swing in public opinion and undermined by some of their own members are scrambling to run down the clock on calls to lift the ban on offshore oil drilling tuesday evening five democratic senators met with five of their republican colleagues to hash out a plan that would include far more drilling from the land and from the sea than would be allowed under any current democratic proposal

6670064 its unusual to be asked what we are going to do ahead of a rate cut but on what we know today this is a pretty simple equation anz chief executive mike smith said today
6670065 if funding costs continue at the current levels and the reserve bank do actually cut rates then there will be a full flow on to our mortgage customers
6670066 they follow them when they go up they should follow them when they go down he said
6670067 i expect the major banks to pass on rate cuts if and when the reserve bank takes that decision

6670096 as well as our project with greenroad we are working with the energy savings trust to conduct green fleet review we are also developing a green travel plan for the entire authority
6670097 while road safety is important greenroad will also help us reduce fuel consumption costs and carbon emissions these were all significant factors in our decision if successful we would hope to roll out safety center across our entire fleet of 140 council vehicles as well our leased and pool cars
6670098 we plan to offer council employees a reduction in their insurance premiums if they install safety center in their own cars
6670099 its not just the council who will benefit from the introduction of greenroad we are partnering with local employers to encourage them to use greenroad safety center and adopt a culture of road safety for the benefit of our entire community we feel it is imperative that we do everything we can to reduce our risk of crashes and casualties
6670100 greenroad has incredible technology that dovetails nicely with derby city councils priority to reduce costs and encourage more sustainable travel
6670101 we feel that with greenroad we are on the verge of something huge our insurance partner is also watching these events closely
6670102 onepoint mobile surveys enable us to offer an alternative way for our various stakeholders specifically the public to engage with us which is a key focus for the council as involving the public in our work is an integral part of the policy making process
6670103 overall we were impressed with the simplicity of the service yet the real pluses for us were that with onepoint survey participants dont incur any costs as the text messages are free to send and receive and that we have the ability to view the results instantly as soon as they come in allows us to keep our finger on the pulse which aids quicker decision making

6670124 the first edition was rushed to print to get the information out to the public but i wanted to add more documentation and mainstream sources to prove the book is extremely accurate
6670125 if you want to save yourself countless hours of endlessly searching the internet and staring at your computer monitor then i encourage you to get a copy of the manifesto youll find that practically every major new world order institution event and philosophy is explained in detail so that anyone with a desire to know the truth will be able to see it crystal clear
6670126 i own most of the old esoteric books that you sometimes hear people talk about when discussing the new world order and the illuminati i have studied them for years and in the manifesto i show that its not just me making claims about what the illuminati is and what their plans are but i clearly show you that illuminati authors have clearly written out their plans in books that are obscure yet available to the public
6670127 it is my sincere hope that people who read the book will come to a better understanding of their purpose in this world and come into a harmonious relationship with devine creator of the universe and stand up for liberty and justice for others
6670128 i had difficult questions about what was happening in the world and i found the answers now i want to share those answers with anyone else who is seeking them

6670136 inilah kali pertama persidangan terhormat ini dihadiri hakim perempuan semoga kelembutannya bermanfaat mengawal konstitusi
6670137 saya juga tidak tahu mengapa dipilih tetapi setelah mengajar saya dihubungi saudara ali nurdin anggota panitia seleksi hakim konstitusi dewan pertimbangan presiden
6670138 menjadi hakim adalah sesuatu yang baru saya akan berusaha keras
6670139 ma hakim itu selama ini identik dengan isu isu buruk
6670140 saya jelaskan bahwa hakim konstitusi bertugas menguji uu terhadap uud jadi persinggungannya dengan kasus suap kecil
6670141 tetapi teman teman di kampus ui mendorong saya mengutamakan kepentingan bangsa menurut mereka mk butuh perempuan yang paham konstitusi karena itu saya mantap ikut seleksi
6670142 katanya untuk memperhalus mk putusan mk memang harus tegas tetapi dalam prosesnya kan bisa ada perspektif yang lebih luas lagi dari perempuan
6670143 keputusan hakim kan tidak hanya melihat masalah pasal pasal di konstitusi tetapi kita juga melihat filsafat hukumnya dan politis hukum yang lebih penting constitutional protection nya
6670144 kalau soal adil atau tidak adil suatu putusan itu tergantung perspektif pihak mana keadilan itu kan relatif
6670145 memang ada hal hal yang perlu dibenahi karena konstitusi dan undang undang kan produk politik yang penting imparsialitas prinsip tidak berpihak tetap dijaga
6670146 jujur saya belum menguasai sepenuhnya karena ini undang undang baru karena itu saya mesti belajar dulu delapan bulan ke depan
6670147 sejak kecil saya terbiasa tidur setengah satu malam untuk belajar setiap hari ini juga yang akan saya lakukan untuk mempelajari seluruh aspek undang undang yang belum saya kuasai

6670163 get out of georgia we dont want trouble here shevardnadze is our friend
6670164 loudly proclaiming its support for georgias territorial integrity in the battle with russia over georgias separatist enclaves
6670165 may have felt that his military after several years of u s sponsored training and rearmament was now capable of routing the ossetian separatists bandits in the official parlance and neutralizing the russian peacekeepers
6670166 immediately transform the conflict into a direct confrontation between a democratic david and an autocratic goliath making sure the sympathy of the western world would be mobilized for georgia
6670167 at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
6670168 we have received formal notification via military channels that russia has decided to halt international military cooperation events until further notice
6670169 everything depends on nato priorities the priority is for unconditional support of georgian president mikheil saakashvili then we wont be to blame for the bankrupting of the alliances relations with russia
6670170 russia no less than nato relies on this mutual cooperation nato is much more in need of russias support of its military actions in afghanistan where natos fate appears to be in the balance

6670176 israel will exist and will continue to exist until islam will obliterate it just as it obliterated others before it
6670177 the islamic resistance movement believes that the land of palestine is an islamic waqf consecrated for future moslem generations until judgement day
6670178 there is no solution for the palestinian question except through jihad initiatives proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors

6670199 we are honored to serve as the opening venue for this historic exhibition on behalf of the museum for african art grass roots speaks to the unique heritage of the lowcountry region and expands our knowledge of an art form that is rooted in our own community
6670200 it is thrilling to be able to tell this story through the coiled basketry traditions that forever link the two continents
6670201 this exhibition is about baskets in both places but because of new scholarship brought to bear on the subject it is really about much more it explores many rich cultural patterns both lost and maintained it shows how people have built and rebuilt their heritage over centuries of oppression and opportunity it reveals how a simple but always beautifully crafted tool has come to be appreciated as an object of art
6670202 the evocative power of historic places to address themes and issues central to american history and culture
6670203 students arent using traditional methods of getting information from authorities

6670206 we hope to create a platform to allow students to communicate to exchange ideas to comment on ideas

6670222 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
6670223 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
6670224 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
6670225 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit

6670234 we have an emerging farm so we do a lot of work out there splitting wood and taking care of the horses
6670235 were thinking of this as a place for artistic and political convergence it will be a place for folks to gather and recharge to swap stories and strategies
6670236 this is a crazy unique time in history where weve got this huge economic crisis at home were waging wars and then we have this question about what the role of theater in all of this is
6670237 a safe place in the city for all kinds of artists to gather and discuss what strategies they are implementing not just here this week but all over the country
6670238 i hope it will become an informal symposium where people can talk about whats working in their communities
6670239 no one knows yet exactly whats going to happen next week so i think theyre a bit freaked theres a whole lot of info out there that says protesters are going to get snatched up immediately if they are not sanctioned
6670240 ill take some artistic liberties with it i see the horse in the background and the mountains the banners this reminds me of the olympics really the opening ceremonies but it has to feel like denver this is our once in a lifetime experience
6670241 conventions are like professional wrestling you know whats going to happen but every four years its fun to watch
6670242 usually the people who try to get celebrities to come around to conventions and stuff want bigger ones than me
6670243 i dont like most politicians so i dont see what the attraction is to go and be in the middle of a bunch of them
6670244 im definitely not going to the convention im going to etown i have a very high opinion of etown theyre good people and they do really good work and i dont think you can say that about most politicians
6670245 i think hes a very encouraging guy a very intelligent man which is of course a complete 180 degree shift from where weve been the last eight years

6670292 dialog city an event converging art democracy and digital media
6670293 as artists were always trying to figure out what can art do especially in political situations where whos controlling the rhetoric is an enormous question and has enormous influence on what happens and how things are perceived
6670294 because my own sensibility is more abstract and more poetic im wondering what place that has
6670295 the whole form of the choir is to me such a metaphor of how do individual voices work together and how does the individual voice relate to the group to me its both a musical form and social metaphor of relatedness
6670296 events actions arise that must be sung that will sing themselves who can doubt that poetry will revive and lead in a new age as the star in the constellation harp shall one day be the polestar for a thousand years
6670297 knowing that its a time when there is a lot of rhetoric and there is a lot of vying and jockeying for space for ones message i wanted to make a piece that would be sung that would be more abstract
6670298 i chose the letter o not initially for obama but thinking that o is the shape the mouth forms when it moves from silence to speech thinking about it as a blood type as a kind of very centralized sound and form
6670299 it went very very smoothly and professionally the whale suffered as little as possible
6670300 este golpe ha de ser especialmente duro para sus ni as creo que deber an saber que ante todo su padre fue un gran piloto
6670301 era agradable compartir vuelo con l porque era cercano a diferencia de otros pilotos

6670303 every year for the past seven years weve held a one day jazz festival on the fourth of july and this presented an opportunity to expand
6670304 not only because denver was chosen to host the dnc but also because well have an african american man being nominated by a major political party for the first time in history
6670305 they could have just gone with a heavy duty lineup of all national acts but they chose to spotlight the flavor of denvers jazz and blues
6670306 we understood that five points really was the spiritual center of denvers african america community and there was a need for us in denver to put its diversity out front
6670307 this area represents denvers jazz heritage and we dont want those things to be lost
6670308 theyre some of the most generous philanthropists that the city has
6670309 theyre developers and engineers so theyre very low key and wont toot their own horns but they started this and just thought it would be a good idea to bring back an excitement to five points
6670310 now youre seeing black families come back and want to be a part of the culture and a lot of young white people move in
6670311 its important to move forward and also important to preserve our history and culture so i think things are coming full circle with sen barack obama coming to town
6670312 from what ive seen he likes to get off the beaten path so who knows
6670313 some of this is about what is the right form at the right time
6670314 says shari frilot a senior programmer at the sundance film festival and its new frontiers section where dubois video
6670315 not only are the artists engaged theres something about the interface that has gotten really interesting in the last four or five years
6670316 its gone beyond an artistic engagement its almost a new voice of the people and the artists are at the vanguard of that
6670317 maybe its a utopian thing but im a huge fan of the idea that we humans have not messed up antarctica as much as other places
6670318 i want people to feel they are immersed in this kind of ice landscape
6670319 being a new yorker and dealing with urban density as my wake up call every morning it was the most quiet and eerily dynamic place ive been the wind makes its own sound as it moves over the ice theres this kind of whirling and keening its this whole different unstable landscape even putting one foot in front of the other makes its own sound
6670320 so i wanted to think of it as cinematic imagery at the edge of the world
6670321 for me this piece is sidestepping a whole notion of what black imagery is
6670322 there are layers of paradox and metaphorical interpretation of how people think of identity
6670323 these guys have been playing well for so many years i just dont feel like i even belong
6670324 but its not really a perfect day im happy with the silver but we know we could have won all the medals
6670325 its very very popular we have the long long coasts and you see everyone come to the beach to watch volleyball and to play volleyball
6670326 beach volleyball is great because there is a good investment from our federation for the money on the tour you can win money next year well maybe offer 50 tournaments
6670327 you put a tournament together and they come if you go to rio or ipanema beach or copacabana beach you see the spots the facilities just for all the little kids theyve got beach theyve got ropes then they are going out and trying to get on the national tours
6670328 all the worlds a stage and all the men and women in it merely players

6670344 im not going to say i wasnt thinking about ichiro being on deck
6670345 hes a finesse guy and the combination of nerves and working on three days rest probably had something to do with him not locating it as well as when hes relaxed

6670349 yes i was busy starting my own production house sanjay kapoor entertainment pvt ltd we have completed the first schedule in norway but during the time anees was completing singh is kinng i completed my acting schedules in zoya akhtars luck by chance and kumar tauranis next directed by kookie gulati
6670350 while luck by chance is a fun tongue in cheek look at and about the film industry with farhan akhtar and konkona sen sharma in the lead roles and has an ensemble cast of rishi kapoor hrithik roshan and juhi chawla all playing film personalities kookies films is an action based film where i play a cop though i missed acting it was a phase and an intentional thing as i was busy with production its been a great experience today its my life is my life

6670353 some construction workers asked for a picture but tom politely said sorry guys i cant stop im walking my wife to work shes got rehearsals to get to contactmusic quoted a source as saying
6670354 heres my one rule dont be totally focused on getting the guy i think that scares them off be happy with your own life be busy with it and think of a guy as the icing on the cake not vital but a nice bonus guys pick up on this laid back attitude and dont feel as if you want or need anything from them and then theyre interested
6670355 its always been my theory that guys love it when you laugh at their jokes or just simply act as if theyre the funniest people on earth it boosts their confidence and what guy doesnt want to be around a woman who makes him feel good theres no need to be completely fake about it just laugh as genuinely as you can when the guy youre into is clearly looking for laughs and encourage him to keep going if it seems like hes on a roll
6670356 i have three older brothers all of whom were huge rugby players so i know about sports just about as much as any guy and actually genuinely love watching games i think guys love it when a girl can talk to them about their favourite team or knowledgeably tease them about why her favourite team is superior to his key to using sports knowledge to impress guys is to not be one of the guys when you do it no guy wants to date someone that could just as easily be one of his male friends instead be a feminine sexy woman who loves sports and shows up in that sports bar in a hot outfit
6670357 i think that guys have always been attracted to the fact that i am uninhibited about sex my attitude has always been compared to samantha jones on sex and the city i think women should enjoy sex without feeling the need for a committed relationship i find that guys are always attracted to this and they more often than not want a relationship when i dont maybe its the whole wanting what you cant have thing but i always find that guys love a woman who feels free to enjoy sex without the emotional trappings as opposed to one who gets very emotional about the physical part of a relationship
6670358 and well be fine with that because its who we are
6670359 it would have been good to see a few approved even as a test its just so different to the way we are

6670404 mr marciani extends his gratitude for a job well done and one that was done with surprising speed so much so that well he
6670405 feels that the task was maybe a bit too easy and thus could be done less expensively
6670406 and i asked for fifty thousand more than whats in my bag seems to be a disappointing day for us all
6670407 i fear the hand wont suffice ms jones a nice touch but people can live without their hands you see

6670455 i have nothing to hide i didnt do anything wrong ive brought this here for you to see
6670456 they should not have been using it equi block they should know that they shouldnt use it they should have known that capsaicin is an ingredient in equi block and that its also a grade a listed substance banned for use at any stage
6670457 this is our third high profile case in terms of banned substances turning up in horses after cian oconnor and in some cases i have great sympathy for the rider but its very damaging for irish equestrian sport
6670458 denis took it out of his tack box and showed it to me he uses it to loosen muscles in the lower back of the horse and he has used it since he got lantinus for the entire year
6670459 this was a big surprise today denis was so certain that it was not a problem that he didnt draw it to my attention thats not unreasonable because he has been using it for a long time and there have been no positive test results for this substance up until these olympic games
6670460 i begged them to let me ride i didnt go looking for a fancy lawyer or high powered pr people i just wanted to come here to explain
6670461 let me say that although this is a bitter pill to swallow we have three boxers still fighting
6670462 we knew we were going to be in the spotlight if it wasnt cheating it was incredible stupidity
6670463 these findings shed light on why in listening environments such as noisy parties or restaurants it is more difficult to follow a conversation involving many people where the relevant talker often and unexpectedly changes locations than to focus on one talker at one location exclusively
6670464 in addition these results may have implications for visual attention in tasks where object formation and target segmentation is challenging or where the identity of a visual object depends upon continuity of visual features over time

6670470 for us the first test of this was russia and it will continue to the gold medal game
6670471 it was the biggest game of the tournament and the biggest night for diana
6670472 the bigger the game the better she is and her confidence oozes out on everyone else
6670473 thats what great teams do they find ways to win
6670474 theyre a great team that had been pounding everyone by about 35 or 40 points so we have to take it as a moral victory we gave it our best shot
6670475 even though the outcome wasnt good this is something that i will always hold with me
6670476 im very thankful for the opportunity to step out there
6670477 hes going to win without a shadow of a doubt hes coming home with the gold
6670478 i was just talking to him and hes in great form we dont talk about boxing he doesnt know about everything thats going on here but im not able for all of this i dont know what to do
6670479 i wont watch it its going to be too nerve wracking but i knew he was going to do well i had it in my head all the time i remember when he rang me from
6670480 were used to the nerves now weve been here before
6670481 his adrenaline was running high after beating one of the tournament favourites
6670482 im absolutely confident he can win you have to be he has his game plan and we have ours and we wont know who wins until one hand is raised up at the end
6670483 when he qualified he said to me that the one fight he wanted was shiming in front of his home crowd and now its happening i am just so proud
6670484 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6670485 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6670486 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6670487 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
6670488 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
6670489 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas

6670515 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away she said
6670516 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6670517 it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat it was absolutely disgusting mr littingham a sea captain told fairfax radio network
6670518 they have towed him behind the boat scenes reminiscent of what weve seen the japanese fishing trawlers do dragged him 400 metres across the bay
6670519 he was clearly still alive he was clearly moving the line was thrashing then theyve dragged him up onto the beach and put him into a tent and now we cant see whats happening and theres a possibility the whale was still alive when he arrived on the beach
6670520 were complaining about what the japanese are doing in the antarctic and were allowing it to happen in pittwater
6670521 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin he said
6670522 that whale is now on the beach under cover and sadly hes passed away
6670523 they had a tractor here and theyre going to drag him up the beach and load him into a tip truck and take him to taronga zoo
6670524 all our experience that orrca has with cetaceans in this situation is that they very easily get stressed and a very quick dont think about it response is not the way to go she said
6670525 you need to gather your information talk to as many people as you can and thats exactly what national parks did
6670526 that was the best way it could have been done he told reporters
6670527 to an untrained person it might not look like the most fantastic thing but you cant get a better result than that he said
6670528 i was there it was done with as little stress as possible to the animal
6670529 the animal when they first got it and sedated it was very quiet very still we brought it onto the beach where it was euthanased by the vets

6670538 padahal jika semuanya diatur dalam sektor itu maka nilai tambah di setiap pola baik hulu maupun hilir tidak akan maksimal
6670539 meski demikian sampai saat ini pola kegiatan hulu dan hilir migas indonesia sudah diatur dalam uu migas jadi jika ada usulan dipisahkan untuk masuk ke uu penanaman modal seperti yang diusulkan pak lutfi itu bisa saja dijadikan masukan
6670540 jika alasan dipisahkan agar investasi di sektor hilir dapat menambah pendapatan negara tidak serta merta seperti itu

6670544 why is there such a gap between perception and reality perhaps because people have been told again and again that open land is disappearing

6670575 the bank holiday really is going to be a mixed bag as far as the weather conditions and temperatures are concerned
6670576 saturday starts off on a good note with dry warm conditions and an overall temperature of 22 degrees celsius
6670577 however rain showers are expected to move eastwards in the afternoon making tomorrow saturday 23 august night and early sunday morning a little damp
6670578 those holding or attending events tomorrow saturday 23 august evening and sunday morning may be disappointed with the damp conditions which have pretty much been seen throughout the whole of august
6670579 as far as late sunday and monday is concerned the rain is expected to clear leaving dry spells for most of the time
6670580 there will be a light breeze and conditions will not be entirely settled but it is expected to be finer and maybe even quite warm at around 20c
6670581 as far as the rest of the month is concerned southern and eastern areas look to be settling down and people can expect some dry weather
6670582 this will make a pleasant change for those who have seen below average temperatures and above average rainfall for august
6670583 september as a whole looks to be more on a par with temperatures and conditions expected for the month with some decent weather and an average temperature of 18c
6670584 our major projects at the moment are along the west coast of england so there are no real worries for cambridgeshire residents
6670585 however as is the case on the roads and at airports the bank holiday is a very busy time so i would urge all those travelling to check their routes first with national rail on the website www nationalrail co uk
6670586 the highways agency is doing everything it can to help drivers with their journeys over the bank holiday weekend
6670587 we have removed as many roadworks as possible and we also provide a number of information services that will help drivers
6670588 before setting off drivers can help prepare their route by tuning into the highways agencys traffic radio available on dab digital radio and at www
6670589 billy came back home the following morning but louis has not been seen since we have had a couple of tipoffs as to where he might be but have had no joy as yet
6670590 he is a very sweet pet and was a birthday gift to my husband after another dog we had passed away we would dearly love to have him back
6670591 i had not spoken to her for ten years but i called her
6670592 she said she had the strong feeling that someone was holding louis and is usually quite accurate
6670593 she had no idea that i lived in yorkshire in the countryside but was certain louis was still alive it certainly made us feel better
6670594 everybody has been very kind helping to look for him
6670595 almost every shop in bedale high street has agreed to put posters in the window even those who said they did not normally allow them
6670596 everybody who knows us knows that billy and louis are like our children
6670597 we have offered a 1 000 reward but would be more than happy to be a bit more generous just to get him back
6670598 this is the totally wrong way of tackling the issue of raising standards
6670599 every school should be analysed and targets set against their intake and the ability of that intake
6670600 at the moment it is a postcode lottery depending on where children come from
6670601 i am only interested in achieving for children beyond their expectations
6670602 im delighted that my former home area has done so well on gcses
6670603 the interest in this case within the chinese community has already been high but i want to be able to speak directly to them to reassure them that we are committed to finding the killer or killers of xi zhou and zhen xing yang
6670604 i also want to appeal to them to come forward to us with any information they may have about the victims or their deaths
6670605 we need to speak to him not only to find out what he might know about other people coming and going from the flat but also to eliminate him forensically from the investigation
6670606 the murderers most likely left the building through the front door the back gate was secured and the walls around the yard are impassable
6670607 the important thing for us is that kids get a solid broad education which makes them better members of society
6670608 you dont need to be a rocket scientist to look at the improvement we have made over the past few years
6670609 the national challenge stuck a label of failure on some of our most dedicated teachers working in the regions most challenging schools
6670610 our results have improved every year since 2003 but these are our best ever
6670611 our success is down to a simple formula of combining excellent teaching with positive well motivated students i must thank everyone at moorside for the equivalent of an olympic gold medal performance
6670612 in 2007 a one year blip in maths led to us being unfairly publicised as a national challenge school so we look forward to a similarly high profile message of congratulation from government ministers for our 2008 results
6670613 i congratulate the headteacher and his staff for their efforts the students for their hard work achievement and motivation in gaining these results and their parents too for the support and encouragement they have given their children well done to all of them
6670614 failing schools because of its academic performance is celebrating increased success in its gcse results

6670619 if there are still question marks on their fitness levels we will decide on whether to take risks and we will decide which of the two players to risk
6670620 again we will have to make some difficult decisions with the technical team because emile has not conceded a goal we will have to speak to them privately before the game
6670621 we have not given up hope of turning this tie around

6670627 as we return to the master s house i want you to notice the beautiful flowers along the path
6670628 did you notice that there were flowers only on your side of the path but not on the other pot s side that is because i have always known about your crack accepting what was given to me i planted flower seeds on your side of the path and every day while we walk back from the stream you ve watered them for two years i have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate my master s table without you being just the way you are he would not have this beauty to grace his house
6670629 the support we have received so far as been excellent
6670630 the industry enthusiastically welcomed the new residential format we introduced last year and this year sponsor organisations are nearly 20 up on last year combined with a bigger and more extensive conference programme additional hands on training opportunities and even more social and networking events this has helped to attract record delegate bookings despite a time of economic uncertainty

6670663 the outlook going forward for 2009 were saying the market is a difficult market were saying the market conditions are probably the worst anyone has seen for a long period of time chief executive greg goodman said
6670664 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of 6 per cent and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6670665 this result is largely due to organic growth mr goodman said
6670666 we have 371 investment properties under management and 97 developments globally giving us the benefit of significant geographic and earnings diversity
6670667 this has enabled us to navigate through a difficult period while no one can forecast when broader market conditions will improve we believe that our business is in good shape to operate through the current cycle
6670668 while there is understandable caution among retailers the world over we remain confident that our multi brand multi region business model will deliver healthy growth and our forward orders support this view
6670669 a very pleasing result in any climate let alone in the prevailing economic conditions
6670670 this again demonstrates the resilience of our business model and the heightened global demand for the groups brands
6670671 however the prospects for 2009 remain less certain particularly if the united states and western european economies continue to be impacted by the financial crisis and commodity price increases
6670672 in addition the new united states president will have to wrestle with twin fiscal and budget deficits in early 2009 and post the olympics chinese growth may slow due to inflationary particularly food price concerns and the impact that a weakening united states economy has on the rest of the world

6670680 were not declaring victory on that front but we are seeing some encouraging signs there he said
6670681 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6670682 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6670683 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6670684 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6670685 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later

6670695 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6670696 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
6670697 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection

6670724 the ecumenical movement at a crossroads after sixty years what does
6670725 vandaag lijken de uitdagingen als het gaat om het zoeken van zichtbare eenheid groter dan ooit

6670727 ik kan niet meer zo ver lopen maar ik vind het heerlijk om hier op een bankje aan de boulevard te zitten
6670728 tegenwoordig moeten mensen vijf dagen na een heup of knieoperatie naar huis terwijl ze nog geen kopje thee van de keuken naar de kamer kunnen brengen ons hotel biedt een alternatief voor een tijdelijk verblijf in een verpleeg of verzorgingshuis de hotel en de zorgfunctie zijn hier even belangrijk vooral de ligging aan zee geeft mensen een vakantiegevoel
6670729 als hun kinderen die regelmatig de helpende band bieden op vakantie zijn gaan vader en moeder naar het herstelhotel hier kan bijvoorbeeld even hulp worden geboden bij het aantrekken van een steunkous ook krijgen we gasten die suikerpati nt zijn of epilepsie hebben en het prettig vinden dat er wat extra aandacht voor hen is het geeft hun een veilig gevoel dat er altijd verpleegkundige hulp beschikbaar is
6670730 er traden complicaties op ik heb negen dagen op de ic gelegen voordat ik naar huis kon was een lange periode van herstel nodig als het niet anders had gekund was ik naar een verpleeghuis gegaan maar ik was bekend met de kim en heb bewust hiervoor gekozen ik heb er zes heerlijke weken gehad met zowel rust als gezelligheid de ligging aan zee spreekt me bovendien zeer aan
6670731 een busreis of iets dergelijks is voor mij niet meer haalbaar ik kan nog maar kleine stukjes lopen
6670732 dat beviel me niet in zon hotel ben je alleen en blijf je alleen ik dacht dat doe ik nooit meer hoewel ik goed alleen kan zijn is wat aanspraak soms wel prettig die heb je in de kim altijd je kunt er bijvoorbeeld alleen eten maar ook aan een gemeenschappelijke tafel dat biedt toch wat gezelligheid
6670733 dat heb ik de afgelopen jaren gelukkig niet nodig gehad maar deze zomer werd ik twee dagen voordat ik zou vertrekken vlak na het diner onwel toen was het fijn dat er meteen een verpleegkundige bij was daarna was ik ook heel snel in het ziekenhuis

6670758 to do lists and agendas are always forward looking inevitably there are traces of the past but this software is never designed to serve this up to us its as if we see the past as completely past whats done is done i am not arguing that me feeds are intrinsically interesting merely that they are useful all this networking all this communication node to node the one party we sometimes neglect is our selves
6670759 until i grasp the whole i am unable to make sense of any part not only am i not a customer for news reports prior to that moment but the very frequency of the updates alienates me from the providers of those updates because the news stream is adding daily to my feeling of being ill informed overwhelmed out of the loop

6670762 markets cause strategic domino effects markets are strategically radical once the basis of competition has been altered an economic tsunami is unleashed often unstoppable the dynamics of competition shift irrevocably in mobile for example apples market driven approach has each player striving to be more open than the last

6670764 if you join a passively multiplayer gaming group youll presumably be willing to yield some of your privacy and tell your buddies what youre up to at any given time just as we sometimes do in an instant messenger client after a while the system will learn your patterns of everyday behavior and become more adept at guessing your activities so if you were to tell the system that youre a smoker itll start to guess that youre smoking a cigarette when you take a brief trip outside

6670767 our feelings our experience of experiences is shaped by our expectations and it would sensible if were trying to create great experiences that we align the expectations to help the case we want to make imagine if they didnt think of it as advertising but thought of it as the ownership experience stretching out in time and media

6670781 having a bar serving alcohol during working hours is completely out of step with community expectations

6670784 they all petered out to nothing the autopsy results are inconclusive and unless information comes forward to suggest who the mother is it will go through to an inquest
6670785 i thought she may have needed medical attention and i would be surprised if she had done so and a doctor had not bothered to tell anybody
6670786 a lot of our work is driven by and relies on assistance from the community if people are prepared to ring up and give us information to go on we follow it up
6670787 the investigation is ongoing and we appeal to anyone who may know who she is to contact crimestoppers
6670788 otherwise it will go to inquest but we need to discuss those issues with the coroner the direction the job is going to take and how they want to handle it as the coroner makes the finding

6670799 ser santo es llegar a purificar de tal forma esa naturaleza humana que brille en ella la divinidad
6670800 muchos santos han sido grandes pecadores como magdalena santa margarita de cortona la mujer escandalosa que lleg a ser de muy buen ejemplo otros han sido presumidos buscadores de honores y placeres como san gabriel de la dolorosa san jos de calazans santa teresa ladrones como san dimas incluso han estado a punto de matar como san guillermo o san juan gualberto o han dado muerte a otros como san conrado de piacenza san ignacio de loyola etc pero todos han luchado contra el pecado y han dejado a jesucristo entrar en su coraz n

6670841 im actually focused now on breaking in as a writer for other artists as opposed to breaking in as the artist
6670842 ideally id love to be the performer i love being in front of an audience but ive got such great songs id love to get them to another artist
6670843 we just couldnt buy a hit when we needed one and frankly japan was the better team tonight
6670844 but i still love this team as athletes its hard to handle the disappointment but its like i told them after the game there will be other things in their life more tragic than what happened tonight
6670845 i suppose if you were worried that you were keeping a sport that the americans were guaranteed to win japan just drove a stake through the heart of that argument
6670846 i just think the real difficulty was that people thought it was womens baseball and the members were mad at baseball for not sending the best players to the games and not caring at all about doping

6670864 we feel as long as this matter is unresolved we create tension both locally and internationally
6670865 if there is a political solution that is legally and constitutionally tenable surely we should all whatever political party we come from encourage it in the national interest after all arent there precedents for this in the established democracies in cases that are broadly similar
6670866 for us it is about what serves the best interests of south africa as a whole we see this as an important matter for business and therefore it needs to be discussed
6670867 the state president should say the case has not been handled properly and it should be reviewed he must point out that the case has been dragging on for eight years and it is damaging the countrys standing internationally
6670868 he did not act when the public protector recommended action against the npa because of the media leaks and when they produced the flawed document called browse mole report which tried to discredit zuma
6670869 with this march we want to drive home the point that we people living with hiv are not happy with the way our money is being used
6670870 we cannot be allowing such exorbitant luxurious expenditure of the taxpayerss money in the face of the dire poverty which is demonstrated by the fact that two thirds of the population are being fed on food aid
6670871 poverty has been with us for many years we cannot then sit by the roadside and weep just because the country is faced with poverty
6670872 by allowing website owners to combine an on site video publishing option for their users with the huge number of people looking to discover new content on youtube the platform will create a mutually beneficial feedback loop that will breathe new life into both youtube and the web at large its also got potential to show up all the other big platform plays weve seen to date
6670873 its almost like it gives other people the power to play god and glean whats happening inside your head
6670874 we are replacing our static per keyword quality scores with a system that will evaluate an ads quality each time it matches a search query this way adwords will use the most accurate specific and up to date performance information when determining whether an ad should be displayed
6670875 were replacing minimum bids with a new more meaningful metric first page bids first page bids are an estimate of the bid it would take for your ad to reach the first page of search results on google web search
6670876 we look at physical safety such as whether toilets are being monitored
6670877 we develop interventions for example if there is substance abuse we look at a service provider who can help
6670878 learners who display irregular behaviour such as bunking classes and basically being unruly
6670879 now and then we conduct random searches and we often find learners with screwdrivers and penknives but so far no guns
6670880 when we asked the learners why they carry such weapons they say they use them to protect themselves in the street
6670881 every year at about this time we see an increase in violent attacks among learners i dont know the cause i always advise staff to be extra vigilant about learners behaviour at this time of the year
6670882 there has to be a considerable and sustained exposure to extreme violent situations
6670883 schools need to have people who take pride and interest in what goes on if schools are well managed problems will be picked up and monitored
6670884 more often than not teenagers committing acts of severe violence have intense and abnormal fascination with heavy metal rock music and lyrics that are aggressive and continuously refer to dark topics such as death violence killing and anger
6670885 i wanna slit your throat and fuck the wound i wanna push my face in and feel the swoon i wanna dig inside find a little bit of me cuz the line gets crossed when you dont come clean
6670886 im not supposed to be here all i have is dead so ill take you with me feel like im erased so kill me just in case
6670887 hell no we dont need no police searches remote controls and metal detectors at my school what for
6670888 if the school lets the police search us it means they dont care about our privacy and dont trust us
6670889 although we had an incident last year when the teachers confiscated a knife from one student after he threatened to stab others
6670890 i think measures such as more security guards should be implemented not sniffer dogs and police officers in our schools
6670891 they wont help us i know the people at my school anyway if the police come here theyll get what they want
6670892 the searches will only waste time and create clashes between the learners and police
6670893 thugs sell cigarettes and dagga to learners from the school fence and they try to disturb us all the time by making noises from the streets
6670894 we have had many incidents where the teachers have found knives screwdrivers and dagga zols on students were not saying police searches are bad but we feel that they might end up causing more problems learners and police dont usually mix
6670895 theyre always in trouble i think they bring weapons to school to scare the little ones its also prestigeous to carry sharp objects and guns at school
6670896 every week the police find stuff on learners last week the teachers confiscated four okapis knives from a girl this week drugs were found hidden in the boys toilets
6670897 but it is not as bad as before when learners were found with hand made guns
6670898 people come in and out as they please and some of them are not even learners here thats why you find people with knives dagga adult magazines and screwdrivers all the time
6670899 blue planet run provides readers with an extraordinary look at the water problems facing humanity and some of the hopeful solutions being pursued by large and small companies by entrepreneurs and activists and by nongovernmental organizations and foundations by the end of the book readers are left to form their own conclusions as to whether the human race is capable of taking the steps necessary to solve this global crisis before its too late
6670900 now i want to write dont make your penis envy my problem somewhere in the entry i suppose that would be a bad idea
6670901 i guess saying it could be the title doesnt help
6670902 who knows if youll be interested in me anymore after youve had the real thing again
6670903 clearly all of your previous dickings have been too shallow
6670904 it will make the freshmen closer and make them more of a family to start with
6670905 this is going to give the freshmen a jump start to a successful career at north surry and in life
6670906 it will help them deal with the transition from one school to another it was designed to help with those types of things
6670907 i dont have to be with all of the upperclassmen
6670908 its pretty cool that well be the start of something new nobody else will be able to say that
6670909 im a little nervous but im excited about just getting back to school to see all of my friends
6670910 i think itll be good well still interact with everyone else but well get one on one attention from the teachers
6670911 we have been absolutely thrilled with the turnout its been a very enthusiastic setting
6670912 it seems like a great kickoff to the school year
6670913 im really excited about starting a new year and about the academy
6670914 weve done a lot of improvements all around the school
6670915 by latching onto the latest fad generated by the homosexual special interest groups hallmark is negating its image as a wholesome company that promotes american values and pro family principles in its products
6670916 just let people have their fun believing in astrology and other such bunk
6670917 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away she said
6670918 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6670919 it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat it was absolutely disgusting mr littingham a sea captain told fairfax radio network
6670920 they have towed him behind the boat scenes reminiscent of what weve seen the japanese fishing trawlers do dragged him 400 metres across the bay
6670921 he was clearly still alive he was clearly moving the line was thrashing then theyve dragged him up onto the beach and put him into a tent and now we cant see whats happening and theres a possibility the whale was still alive when he arrived on the beach
6670922 were complaining about what the japanese are doing in the antarctic and were allowing it to happen in pittwater
6670923 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin he said
6670924 that whale is now on the beach under cover and sadly hes passed away
6670925 they had a tractor here and theyre going to drag him up the beach and load him into a tip truck and take him to taronga zoo
6670926 all our experience that orrca has with cetaceans in this situation is that they very easily get stressed and a very quick dont think about it response is not the way to go she said
6670927 you need to gather your information talk to as many people as you can and thats exactly what national parks did
6670928 that was the best way it could have been done he told reporters
6670929 to an untrained person it might not look like the most fantastic thing but you cant get a better result than that he said
6670930 i was there it was done with as little stress as possible to the animal
6670931 the animal when they first got it and sedated it was very quiet very still we brought it onto the beach where it was euthanased by the vets
6670932 its a long way offshore in a really remote isolated location a national parks and wildlife service spokeswoman said
6670933 we will attempt to see if we can collect dna samples however the weather is really bad down there
6670934 once the weather has cleared our staff will look at options for relocating it
6670935 we have some issues to work through in trying to retrieve it
6670936 its possible that its the mother but there are hundreds and hundreds of humpback whales across the coast at this time of the year and its not uncommon to have carcasses
6670937 s lo quedan p ginas as que m s te vale que echen humo
6670938 hurry grab your clothes and jump out the window my husband is home early
6670939 i cant jump out the window its raining like hell out there
6670940 if my husband catches us in here he will kill both of us
6670941 oh yes it feels so free having the air blow over your skin while you are running
6670942 do you always run carrying your clothes on your arm
6670943 oh yes that way i can get dressed at the end of the run and get in my car to go home
6670944 i stand in solidarity with the jerusalem declaration and statement on the global anglican future
6670945 it would be a cruel society to force women to become mothers when they clearly dont want to or are not prepared for the huge task ahead of them
6670946 difference between an unwanted pregnancy and an unwanted baby many children who are at first unwanted by their mothers are very much wanted later in the pregnancy and even more so at birth the problem is not unwanted children but unwanting adults
6670947 for years women were degraded when their value was judged by whether or not they were wanted by men just as a womans value is real whether or not a man recognizes it so a babys value is real whether or not his mother or father recognizes it
6670948 it is very difficult to demonstrate that the moral and metaphysical value of a human being is dependent on whether someone wants or cares for that human being for example no one disputes that the homeless are intrinsically valuable even though they are for the most part unwanted
6670949 the ethic of the child batterer is the abortion ethic child abusers like abortion activists believe in adults right to be in control of their lives child abusers like abortionists believe that only children who gratify parental desires have a right to exist it is hard to believe that the cultural message contained in abortion the insistent eulogies to control and the references to parenting as a right and a pleasure have not contributed to the explosion in child abuse and neglect
6670950 there is no assurance that the child that was planned for will continue to be well treated by its parent or parents indeed over 90 per cent of the children in the united states who are abused by their parents were originally wanted babies at all events and notwithstanding the annual one and a half million abortions there is no indication that family life in america is becoming happier on the contrary since abortion on demand was made legal in 1973 the number of abused children is estimated to have risen by over 300 per cent
6670951 death rates from infections and all types of surgeries including illegal abortions had already fallen precipitously after world war ii when antibiotics finally became available to the general public
6670952 i confess that i knew the figures were totally false and i suppose the others did too if they stopped to think of it but in the morality of our revolution it was a useful figure widely accepted so why go out of our way to correct it with honest statistics the overriding concern was to get the laws eliminated and anything within reason that had to be done was permissible
6670953 in 1967 the federal government listed only 160 deaths from illegal abortion in the last year before roe v wade 1972 the total was only 39 deaths

6670955 we absolutely do not support any remark that hurts the chinese peoples feelings
6670956 the result is that during a period when reporting freedoms for foreign journalists in china should be at an all time high
6670957 the citys residents cough their eyes burn a sticky wet film forms on everything dust particles nitrous oxide and sulfur dioxide concentrations rise to dramatic levels the authorities send out text messages to warn asthma sufferers to stay indoors and close the windows
6670958 so too at the human level china offers a political and social landscape in which the individual fits in or gets out

6670975 we are calling for a genuine peace negotiation not the kind of sham that we are witnessing in this moa ad
6670976 these recent developments in the south lead to a change in the basic premise of our peace efforts the focus of our talks shall shift from armed groups to the community the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiment
6670977 translated this shall mean a national rejection of the armed model as a means of achieving political and societal change and reaffirming our commitment to democracy our engagements with all armed groups shall be about disarmament demobilization and rehabilitation or ddr
6670978 theres a possibility of looking at where the students live and possibility of redistricting but at this point im going to have to make a recommendation to the board but you have to keep in mind that my concern is to ensure that facilities are safe and that we provide a healthy environment for our students
6670979 the only comment is that they personnel office need to concentrate on what theyre doing especially when theyre working on timesheets people have bills to pay and once you mess with their time sheet and they dont get paid they get angry
6670980 we talked about having our people look at it but they never got a response from the australians

6671034 nuri will be rather close to hong kong this afternoon and tonight with a chance of a direct hit
6671035 it may be necessary to issue higher signals this afternoon
6671036 the airlines should have broadcast the latest typhoon news in the airport and made arrangements for us to stay somewhere its the first time ive come to hong kong and now i have no idea what to do here
6671037 we are fortunate that the competition finished before typhoon nuri hit hong kong
6671038 im looking forward to pulling it together and getting guys back and just flying around out there
6671039 i think weve been on our heels definitely these last two preseason games some of us didnt play in the first one and some of us didnt play in the second one but im looking forward to getting to this third one and trying to bring it together as a team and kind of get the ball rolling a little bit
6671040 the guys that get the chance to participate in the game im sure they will be able to utilize that to help them prepare for the season
6671041 not everybody will participate but the guys that do that will be good for them the guys that dont hopefully they will get it some other time or they have already gotten it
6671042 yeah weve been practicing well but we havent translated it in the first two preseason games
6671043 thats kind of a little bummer right there we have a lot more things to work on as far as where we thought we were compared to what weve been showing
6671044 as far as were concerned im concerned not from the scoreboard but just from the plays within were behind
6671045 and we need to pick it up as far as the details and the little things flying to the ball not having missed tackles just knowing your assignment its really just fundamental things that are breaking down that are affecting the big things out there thats all we got to do is just tighten down on the fundamentals
6671046 you can say preseason all you want but thats what weve shown out there and right now were not doing things so well
6671047 we still have a couple of weeks to get better thats the good thing we havent been great so far but we havent been totally bad we havent won yet but we have a lot of time to correct those mistakes before we open up
6671048 he chose money over championships and thats the way it goes sometimes
6671049 asantes a great player so it hurts not to have a guy like that but then again its part of the business of the game
6671050 i was talking at viking adrian petersons football camp and a kid asked a question and i was just kind of joking around about it and didnt realize i was going to be quoted on the whole deal
6671051 it was just one of those deals ive talked to asante and he understands the whole deal so its all good
6671052 no no you know i mean hes a good dude
6671053 he was a good player here and he still is a good player im good friends with asante so i can sit there and joke around with him and stuff its definitely a deal that got blown out of proportion
6671054 yeah its going to be strange to see the no 22 in green
6671055 weve been used to seeing him around here for his whole career it will be fun too he kind of knows us a little bit and we know him
6671056 it always feels weird initially when you see a guy on the other team but it is what it is
6671057 it used to be you stay with a team 10 12 years your whole career its just not like it used to be i wasnt around then but im hearing it from older guys its just the nature of the beast man you just move along
6671058 this is a guy that was a starter on a super bowl team and always made a good dollar
6671059 seven or eight years ago he was in the mid 2 millions this is not a junk player the question is how much does he have left i asked him that hes not going to try to go back to the guy that started the super bowl but hes a smarter player now
6671060 i was in all the meetings i watched practice film with them so i dont think i really got behind
6671061 its good to go out there and get some physical reps and just get out there and practice i think im ready to work back into it now
6671062 bill has a knack for not telling you anything he just kind of puts you in the heat of the moment to kind of see how youre going to respond to it
6671063 i had my mind set going into the game that i was probably going to get thrown into the fire and get a couple of kickoff returns

6671078 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6671079 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6671088 an important reason to study metacognitive monitoring processes is because monitoring is supposed to play a central role in directing how people study
6671089 our research affects issues of cognitive intellectual development and can be used to develop training programs particularly for young children to ensure adequate metacognitive processing in educational contexts
6671090 these findings shed light on why in listening environments such as noisy parties or restaurants it is more difficult to follow a conversation involving many people where the relevant talker often and unexpectedly changes locations than to focus on one talker at one location exclusively
6671091 in addition these results may have implications for visual attention in tasks where object formation and target segmentation is challenging or where the identity of a visual object depends upon continuity of visual features over time
6671092 my great thanks to anne at just muttering for her very kind congratulatory post from my best wishes to her
6671093 well thank you what a nice thing to say your site has some bragging rights too one of my favorites
6671094 jau added an interesting post on 20 most re read books heres a small excerpt quote view the rest of this entertaining post
6671095 there has been much comment on the blogosphere on the weird mr craig but
6671096 im glad you found me because otherwise i wouldnt have found you and thus might have missed the fun of your blog keep on muttering mightily
6671097 great idea much too much pessimism abroad in the world these days
6671098 your blog looks wonderful and i am so honored that you added me to your blogroll i look forward to visiting you more
6671099 i like the new look the graphic is especially cute
6671100 if you want a healthy dose of knitting and common sense then i advise you go over to just muttering and partake of the wisdom contained therein
6671101 patient test knitter jmbm who by the way should walk on water the way shes been with me

6671103 very nice blog culture knitting and all sorts of other fun things
6671104 you can see the spin coming off the oppositions racquet on clay so if its sliced its going to stay low if its top spin its going to kick up spin is exaggerated
6671105 but clay can change a great deal if youve just had a bit or rain and the surface is a bit moist the balls will pick up water and theyll be come heavy
6671106 that slows the ball down even more making it very hard to hit winners
6671107 on the other hand if its hot and sunny and youve got a nice dusty court then the ball will zip through like a harder surface
6671108 so you need to be flexible and patient on clay sometimes you need to grind it out you arent going to hit any winners unless youre a brutal hitter of the ball
6671109 the movement is different because you must time your slide which can be anything up to two metres
6671110 of course if you dont slide at all you cant get back to cover the court and youll be out of position it can be the difference between winning and losing a point
6671111 many players use an open stance and often your foot is planted on the floor because of the loose nature of the surface you really need to be flexible in your movement and quick adjustment
6671112 you need to dictate otherwise youre doing all the running all the moving and the slipping and sliding

6671171 peningkatan kualitas pendidikan menjadi hal yang sangat penting bagi pemerintah untuk ke depan
6671172 pemerintah harus fokus pada pembinaan generasi muda yang bakal masuk ke pasar kerja sejak mereka masih sekolah mereka sangat berpotensi dan mampu menyerap berbagai hal yang bisa meningkatkan kompetensi dan keahliannya sesuai kebutuhan pasar kerja
6671173 minimnya kompetensi dan keahlian lulusan sekolah formal terlihat dalam bursa bursa kerja yang semakin sering diselenggarakan sejak tahun 2006 meskipun peminat setiap bursa membeludak hampir 30 persen lowongan kerja yang tersedia tidak terisi karena pelamar tidak memenuhi kriteria pemberi kerja artinya lapangan kerja tersedia kompetensi peminat tak memenuhi persyaratan yang diminta

6671181 that equals to about a medal and a half for each hour he spent in combat there were infantry guys grunts on the ground who had more than 7 000 hours in combat and i can tell you that there were times and situations where im sure a prison cell would have looked pretty good to them by comparison the question really is how many guys got that number of medals for not being shot down

6671273 but of course we then have no choice but to sit in the opposition i would very much like to see this coalition stay in tact i would be the last person who wants to see it disintegrating but this coalition wasnt without an agenda and that agenda is strengthening democracy the rule of law and to restore the constitution and judges the judges were illegally removed without any constitutional authority so if we dont restore them what are we doing thats the core issue
6671274 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6671275 one might even say that if americans were simply evil they would be a lot more likable

6671279 property records show that cindy mccains trust recently bought a condo at the residences at 2211 camelback for 4 66 million
6671280 the deal was actually for two condos that could be combined to one space of 6 000 to 7 000 square feet that is plenty of elbow room even for a high end condo in a region where the typical single family home runs about 1 600 square feet
6671281 cindy mccain heiress to the john hensley liquor empire paid 3 million for two units which the couple combined for 6 000 square feet
6671282 a main house guest house and caretakers quarters and total more than 4 800 square feet
6671283 mccain said the valley was settled by mormons and that the hidden valley ranch got its name from the horseshoe shape of the creek that runs through the property he said he built the first house on his property 24 years ago and now there are six houses on his lot
6671284 one of the most spectacular creekfront properties in the state
6671285 its called hidden valley and everyone who sees it says they would never expect to find such a beautiful place in such an arid climate
6671286 one of the most spectacular creekfront properties in the state lush lawns go from their house gently down to the waters edge the creek makes a natural pool there its very romantic
6671287 includes four single family homes and is worth nearly 1 8 million
6671288 john mccain held a barbecue recently for reporters at a two story cabin near sedona ariz that sits on 15 acres owned by his wifes family trust and a real estate partnership in her name the property includes four single family homes and is worth nearly 1 8 million
6671289 meghans parents senator john and cindy mccain bought her this loft around the time she graduated from columbia university last spring and the interior looks like a spaceship furnished by west elm theres a giant silver chimney that extends out of her fireplace into the ceiling about twenty feet above across the living room is a very stylish and very uncomfortable looking pod chair
6671290 i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and a few coaches so its a big surprise im still in shock that my dreams have come true its been a long month and i am really happy to be back in dallas
6671291 when i texted her that night she won all around i told her she would be doing interviews for hours but to call me when she can
6671292 we try to do things away from the gym and have girl nights
6671293 im going to probably keep them in my purse for now
6671294 between the two of us we have nine olympic medals so thats pretty amazing
6671295 on her first day back well take them down because shes back with us under our roof
6671296 we are so ready to get back to normal whatever that is
6671297 shell have a limp the rest of her life and will never get a lot of use in her hand but were going to make darn sure she gets as much use as she can
6671298 a kid cant really be a kid unless they can get on the floor
6671299 my hope is that she grows up and does normal things like a normal kid like a normal adolescent like a normal teenager and like a normal adult
6671300 i want her to grow up and be a normal happy person who contributes to society
6671301 were at the point in the program where wed normally begin to hire more folks
6671302 its going to be one of the major purchases across a lifetime and so the old model of how to plan for this no longer applies
6671303 we need to try to get families away from a semester to semester fire drill in terms of how theyre going to pay for this
6671304 under the new plan youll be buying tuition units equal to a percent of the years costs as opposed to buying credit hours
6671305 the last plan at the time didnt look like that great a deal but in retrospect it was
6671306 i just thought she had a little kitchen fire to put out
6671307 i starting pulling on the catheter but its tough you cant break it with the naked hand
6671308 i said baby get something to cut it and that lady went back into the kitchen quick
6671309 she came back with a knife and she cut it by then flames were going up to the ceiling
6671310 but he never hollered and he never cried i dont think he ever got scared
6671311 shes tough i said baby you got to get out of here but she was determined to stay there until he was out of that house
6671312 frank had him up in his arms and carried him out
6671313 the power had just come back on again when the fire was noticed
6671314 my husband would have burned because i couldnt get him out
6671315 when i say my prayers i say god please give me the strength to help somebody if i ever come across somebody in that position
6671316 all parties are satisfied with the agreement and ms horton was charming
6671317 i would think that many homeowners would have concerns over living in a house that has a line that has that much natural gas under pressure
6671318 given the choice of two equally nice houses are people going to elect to buy that house with that natural gas line in the front yard
6671319 that was one of the options we have under consideration for carter avenue as well

6671322 we are hoping their financial situation will improve but we also expect they will pay us before they open on sept 12
6671323 we knew nothing about it until the bus showed up and thats just not the way we like to do business in sundance

6671344 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6671345 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6671346 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6671347 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6671348 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6671349 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6671355 i feel very disappointed i dont know why i dont think i had any technical problems or mistakes i got a silver four years ago but now its only a bronze its such a pity
6671356 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6671357 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6671358 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6671359 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6671360 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6671361 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6671362 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6671363 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6671364 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6671365 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6671366 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6671367 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6671368 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6671369 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6671370 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6671371 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6671372 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6671373 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6671374 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6671375 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6671376 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6671377 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6671378 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6671379 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6671380 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6671381 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6671382 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6671383 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6671384 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6671385 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6671386 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6671387 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6671388 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6671389 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6671390 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6671391 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

6671395 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6671396 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6671397 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6671398 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6671399 ich denke wir sollten zuerst die wissensl cken aufarbeiten damit ihr kind in der schule wieder mitkommt
6671400 ich k nnte mir vorstellen dass es sinn macht dass ihr kind erst einmal lernt wie man eigentlich wirklich lernt leider wird das nicht in der schule vermittelt
6671401 es h rt sich f r mich so an dass ihr kind vielleicht unter lernblockaden leidet das kann man nat rlich erst genau sagen wenn ich mich einmal mit ihrem kind unterhalten habe darf ich ihnen einen unverbindlichen gespr chstermin f r ihr kind anbieten
6671402 frau meier ich kann gut verstehen dass sie sich sorgen machen aber ihr kind ist mit diesem problem nicht allein wir hatten gerade ein m dchen hier das wir jetzt verabschieden konnten sie hat sich von einer 5 auf eine 3 verbessert
6671403 das kommt immer wieder vor und es hat nichts damit zu tun dass ihr kind nicht intelligent genug ist machen sie sich keine sorgen wenn wir die wissensl cken aufarbeiten dann bekommen wir das problem sicher in den griff

6671408 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6671409 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6671410 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

6671416 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6671417 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6671418 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6671419 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6671420 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6671421 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6671422 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6671423 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6671424 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6671425 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6671426 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6671427 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6671428 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6671429 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6671430 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6671431 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6671432 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6671433 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6671434 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6671435 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6671436 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6671437 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6671438 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6671439 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6671440 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6671441 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6671442 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6671443 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6671444 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6671445 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6671446 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6671447 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6671448 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6671449 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

6671459 imagine a farmer walking into a bank and getting a crop loan if the banker were to offer him along with a bank loan a protection to ward off a downslide in the prices in the form of a put option on his produce till options are allowed a similar product could be offered as a forward cover based on the futures price prevailing on that day the farmer will willingly pay a price for the cover the options forward contract could be bundled into small contracts banks retailing put option contracts for the convenience of the farmer similarly the bank could offer a call option again in the form of easy to understand forward cover product to the grain merchant or the flour mill owner against a rise in the price the bank could in turn take a protection in the futures market also weather derivatives10 will be a useful tool for the banks to manage npa as weather derivative could be used as a proxy for hedging agriculture risk
6671460 we work really hard on field position and a big part is not taking penalties but we took too many and thats a lack of discipline

6671473 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6671474 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6671475 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6671476 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6671477 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6671478 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

6671482 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
6671483 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6671484 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6671485 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6671486 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6671487 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa

6671490 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6671491 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6671492 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6671493 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

6671495 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

6671499 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6671500 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6671501 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6671502 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6671503 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6671504 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6671505 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6671506 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6671507 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6671508 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6671509 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6671510 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6671511 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6671512 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6671513 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6671514 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6671515 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6671516 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6671517 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6671518 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6671519 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6671520 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6671521 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6671522 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

6671531 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6671532 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6671533 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6671534 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista

6671537 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6671538 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6671539 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6671540 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6671541 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6671542 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley

6671546 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6671547 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6671548 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6671549 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6671679 there are obviously always little dramas you are on set for 16 hours so people get irritable in any workplace there are always little things and frustrations
6671680 i dont want to speak about the team before my arrival
6671681 i am looking to build a team mentality passion and everything this is my problem
6671682 when they play in the national team they play against the best xi from another country and the level is high it is not as easy as when you play with the club it is different
6671683 the movement of rooney and the work that he does in every game is very important for me
6671684 i think rooney gerrard and other players are not in perfect condition physically at the moment that will be very important
6671685 maybe at times i am a bit too honest and at club level the manager is telling me not to defend too much to try and save some energy for when we are attacking
6671686 but sometimes you just want to win the ball back and work hard for the team that is just how i play
6671687 maybe it does affect my goals tally but hopefully i can learn and get better
6671688 you have to understand that this player was not in a good condition at the moment
6671689 it was the first time they played without fear at wembley well or not well but they played with no fear this is important this is the style of the english player
6671690 i spoke with some people in the dressing room and after the first half they were happy also the players
6671691 in the first half we shot six or seven times and i think one of the best players was petr cech because he made three saves this is important for me
6671692 beckham plays not only for free kicks and set pieces but because he plays well
6671693 with beckham rio ferdinand or john terry it is the same if they do not play well they are not going to play

6671714 i wanted to come to arsenal because the potential to win trophies is there and the fire is still in my heart
6671715 hopefully i can look forward to a fresh start without any injuries
6671716 i left united especially because i did not want to spend any more time on the bench after nine years
6671717 i did not want to spend an extra one just waiting for the testimonial to arrive that is not my mentality
6671718 i was looking at a new challenge and when someone like arsenal comes along you cannot say no
6671719 it will be natural to give some advice but i will not be focusing on that
6671720 the main thing is to be part of the team and perform well to show an example on and off the field
6671721 i would not have expected that but sir alex ferguson and i had a very good relationship that is why i stayed so long there because playing for him was a great honour
6671722 he listened to me and would not go against me so i am pleased
6671723 it is hard to leave because there are so many nice people there
6671724 but the fans will understand that as a player you leave
6671725 i was loyal to man united for nine years and will now be loyal to arsenal and perform as much as i can which is all that matters
6671726 i cannot tell you much more hes one of the players we follow
6671727 i find barry a good player the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6671728 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best
6671729 i dont know whether he finished the medical or not he can explain to you but i heard he was completely free

6671754 the net is the very best thing that has ever happened to everybody but superstars
6671755 i took a lot from the early slasher films that were relevant not just the friday the 13th but the more obscure ones and the ones with lofi themes and i brought them together with a more modern cinematic element
6671756 these movies arent really done anymore so we updated the genre with modern lighting modern editing blood night is based on an actual long island legend if you lived here as a teenager you defiantly came across the legend at some point
6671757 the actual body count is 29 i have two favorite kills my favorite is the mary hatchet and mother kill its very in your face and shocking i dont want to give to many details yet but if you are a fan of gore your going to enjoy it
6671758 one of the locations is a residential home so we registered for the permits under the home owners name
6671759 we found early on during the location scouting as soon as we said the name of the film we were almost being treated like a porno movie people didnt want to be associated with horror so we changed the working title to the legend of mary maddock the characters name in the movie
6671760 we legally started shooting and out of spite they started fining the home owner for anything they could think of
6671761 body count aside we have a few distributors lined up ready to see it and we are defiantly intending to go theatrical i think its theater worthy the production value is really high so we should have a good chance

6671783 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6671784 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6671785 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6671786 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6671787 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6671788 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6671789 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6671790 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6671791 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6671792 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6671793 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6671794 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6671795 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6671796 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6671797 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6671798 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6671799 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6671800 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6671801 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6671802 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6671803 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6671804 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6671805 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6671806 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6671807 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6671808 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6671809 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6671810 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6671811 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6671812 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6671813 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6671814 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6671815 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6671816 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6671817 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6671818 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6671819 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6671820 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6671821 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6671822 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6671823 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6671824 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6671825 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6671826 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6671827 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6671828 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6671829 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6671830 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6671831 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6671832 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6671833 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6671834 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6671835 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6671836 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6671837 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6671838 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6671839 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6671840 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6671841 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6671842 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6671843 it looks great its neither too feminine nor flashy but classy and well styled its easy enough to get a child seat in the back and the soft top roof leaves more boot space than a folding hard top
6671844 the visit aims at assessing the situation of human rights and access of the people to the humanitarian aid
6671845 i am especially interested in the conditions of internally displaced persons and refugees and their opportunities of secure and voluntary return to their homes
6671846 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6671847 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items

6671976 this allows devices to reliably write the bits by pulses of only one nanosecond duration using this technique future st mram spin torque mram could operate as fast as the fastest volatile memories
6671977 in the future st mram has a very broad field of applications

6672087 i am 20 years old i am self revealing neat unpredictable silly charming aggressive assertive organized and far from ordinary i happen to be a social chameleon
6672088 every time theres an attack like the one on the french my phone starts ringing
6672089 what should worry us is that the taliban movements are no longer isolated to the south
6672090 everything is directed by pakistan everybody knows that this is a fact because the big commanders of the taliban are in quetta
6672091 that means the army will also be watching the home front and less inclined to climb into the mountains and fight the taliban to do us a favour
6672092 if i was a canadian general i couldnt do anything more than they are doing
6672093 canadians will fail because of their afghan partners their partners still dont get it their partners are weak and are not doing their job
6672094 who gave which gift to who who is flying to dubai on which airline who is sitting in which position this is all the debates
6672095 what id say is they are much more aggressive this fighting season than they have been in the past
6672096 the difference is they are not holding any of the ground that they attack us on so in the case of an ied improvised explosive device strike they will inflict some casualties but they dont control the road that they inflicted the casualties on so really the net effect is zero
6672097 i was behind the convoy when they reached a place where the road was already destroyed by a land mine
6672098 another land mine exploded on the canadian convoy near to howz e madad in the zhari district the tank was completely destroyed i dont think one of soldiers will be alive in that tank
6672099 he was a devoted father who liked to share stories with his children colleagues and friends
6672100 an engineer reconnaissance team is a tight knit unit and these men were no exception they were a well trained highly motivated crew and believed in their mission as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with technical knowledge they generously used in this mission to help the people of kandahar
6672101 the taliban are against things they are not for anything they are against human rights they are against education they are against health care they are against women they are just against human decency
6672102 if we leave the population of kandahar province in the hands of the taliban we just wont be performing our duty and our soldiers know that

6672105 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6672106 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6672107 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6672108 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6672109 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6672110 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6672111 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6672112 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6672113 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6672114 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6672115 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6672116 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6672117 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6672118 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6672119 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6672120 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6672121 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6672122 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6672123 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6672124 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6672125 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6672126 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6672127 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6672128 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6672129 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6672130 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6672131 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6672132 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6672133 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6672134 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6672135 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6672136 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6672137 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6672138 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
6672139 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
6672140 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
6672141 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6672142 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6672143 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6672144 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6672145 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6672146 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6672147 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6672148 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6672149 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6672150 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6672151 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6672152 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6672153 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6672154 this is likely to be a long hot summer of challenges for lehman and its ceo

6672160 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6672161 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6672162 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6672163 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6672164 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6672165 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6672166 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
6672167 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6672168 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6672169 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6672170 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6672171 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6672172 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6672173 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
6672174 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
6672175 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6672176 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6672177 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6672178 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6672179 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6672180 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6672181 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6672182 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6672183 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6672184 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6672185 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6672186 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6672187 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6672188 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6672189 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6672190 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6672191 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6672192 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6672193 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6672194 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6672195 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6672196 its not something were specifically planning for right now the development team is working on the game and the interface with the pc and the pc interface peripherals in mind
6672197 these trucks were not targeted by any rioter and were shown on tv and the authorities claimed that there was no blockade
6672198 we want india to accept the referendum against it and shun its stubbornness over the region
6672199 we wont allow india to change the demographic and geographic character of the state such moves would be fought tooth and nail as and when they surface he vowed
6672200 we are not against the hindu religion or the yatra yatris have been welcome in the valley for more than 130 years now and would be welcome in future as well
6672201 magazines are dead people get everything from tv or the internet now
6672202 on thursday evening 1000 hindu rioters carrying swords tridents trishuls and other sharp edged weapons entered bishnah village forced muslims to recite
6672203 we had no alternative but to flee from the place we are presently putting up at sujma narwal which falls in batindi where other muslim refuges are taking shelter
6672204 when we refused they threatened to take away our womenfolk
6672205 we had no option but to migrate from the area for the safety of our womenfolk indian policemen in uniform also accompanied the rioters they spoke on behalf of rioters and asked us to leave the place or we will be thrown out
6672206 before leaving the place the rioters set 25 hutments on fire
6672207 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
6672208 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6672209 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6672210 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6672211 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief

6672213 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6672214 there is a lot of discussion around the country that this is ripe for a lawsuit
6672215 our state is enacting educational policy not based on consideration for what is the best most effective way of teaching kids
6672216 our state is enacting educational policy based on ideological commitments to notions that are entirely unrelated to education theyre related to immigration and anxiety about the predominance of other languages in our society
6672217 i think within two years youll see a dramatically higher rate of students being classified as knowing english this will be a tremendous benefit for them
6672218 theres a court case that says it is not segregation for a school to temporarily for educational purposes put them in a different classroom thats the only way to make them successful you dont make them successful by putting them in a class where they have no idea whats going on because they cant speak english
6672219 by the time theyre taking the psat its much too late to determine whether they should be taking algebra in the eighth grade biology and other important gatekeeper classes needed for college
6672220 this test will help schools identify students who have some talent and could likely succeed if they take honors or ap courses but have not been recognized
6672221 just because you go to a public school you should still have the same opportunities
6672222 if you want your kid to go to a highly selective institution you really do have to know in the eighth grade
6672223 theyre locked in a death match with act over who takes the act or the sat once you buy into a certain product line youre likely to stick with it
6672224 by the time they apply to school the results would not be relevant
6672225 that plays out in kids real lives most of them are taking a hodgepodge of classes and by the end of 11th grade its too late
6672226 eighth grade is not the key year for college assessment thats sixth grade
6672227 now were going to have a preadmission test to get ready for the preadmission test get ready to get ready to get ready
6672228 to believe you need an eighth grade test on top of the psat and sat is just insane
6672229 we have people in sacramento and in political offices that think that accountability is testing and accountability is not testing
6672230 the eighth grade california standards test should tell us how children are prepared for high school im not sure we need it again in the ninth grade in the 10th grade and then the 11th grade teachers are so loaded down with tests they have very little time to teach anymore
6672231 our primary purpose is to check on how effectively are schools preparing students and we see them as very important
6672232 california has a very shabby test setup a lot of these testing outfits are entrepreneurial theyre trying to make a buck
6672233 if there is a market to be served to add another test theyre more than willing to do that but if the test is well conceived it will have an instructional yield links to the texas education agency statutes amp regulations links to select publications by angela valenzuela
6672234 the report found that over 22 000 teachers were mis assigned meaning they werent credentialed to teach their subject or trained to teach english learners
6672235 english learners are not getting the teachers they need to succeed in california schools or our state thats a big problem
6672236 communal elements have kept the pot boiling in jammu for their own vested interests they have flared up communal passions to derive maximum mileage in the elections
6672237 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6672238 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6672239 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6672240 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6672241 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6672242 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6672243 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6672244 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6672245 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6672246 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6672247 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6672248 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6672249 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6672250 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6672251 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6672252 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6672253 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6672254 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6672255 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6672256 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6672257 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6672258 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6672259 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6672260 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6672261 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6672262 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6672263 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6672264 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6672265 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6672266 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6672267 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6672268 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6672269 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6672270 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6672271 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6672272 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6672273 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6672274 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6672275 tmb for this time is going to sell its 51 per cent holding and following the transaction tmb will not be holding any share mr nattorn told aap
6672276 the price will be announced after the closing date he said
6672277 in september we will inform the stock exchange of thailand
6672278 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
6672279 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
6672280 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
6672281 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet

6672283 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
6672284 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
6672285 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him
6672286 the most inexperienced ticket in the history of the world
6672287 democrats on the ground and their operators from the democratic national committee and the state organization and the gore campaign deliberately and systematically scrutinized for challenge every military absentee ballot and knocked out as many as they could on whatever technicality they could find or even invent
6672288 the iraqis who have risen up against the occupation are not insurgents or terrorists or the enemy they are the revolution the minutemen and their numbers will grow and they will win
6672289 osama bin laden and these non nation state fighters with religious purpose are very similar to those kinds of atypical revolutionaries that helped to cast off the british crown
6672290 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6672291 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6672292 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list

6672295 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6672296 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6672297 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6672298 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6672299 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6672300 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6672301 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes

6672310 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783

6672313 a magical exuberant tragic comic vision of postcolonial malaysia reminiscent of rushdie and roy
6672314 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
6672315 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6672316 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6672317 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6672318 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6672319 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods
6672320 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6672321 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6672322 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6672323 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6672324 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6672325 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6672326 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6672327 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6672328 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6672329 of his race and questions about his patriotism values and faith that republicans have already vigorously sought to raise and exploit

6672340 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6672341 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6672342 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6672343 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6672344 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6672345 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6672346 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6672347 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6672348 we have known for some time that young and middle aged adults who are overweight run a higher risk of death and it was presumed that this held true for older people in fact our results show that the risk of dying is higher only for the most severely obese but that all older people who are overweight are at significantly increased risk of developing problems with mobility and carrying out everyday tasks
6672349 this research is important because a growing proportion of the population is aged 65 or over and more and more of these older people are overweight in fact in most developed countries middle aged and elderly adults are more likely to be obese than people in any other age group these findings have huge significance for the delivery of health care both now and in the future increasing numbers of older people and higher levels of overweight and obesity will lead to a greater burden of disability and ill health and place an immense strain on health and social services the issue is likely to get worse as time goes on and represents a ticking time bomb for health services around the world
6672350 staying a healthy weight can be a fun and relatively easy thing to do even as people get older
6672351 our experience of running supported walking and cycling groups has shown that older people benefit in many ways from regular physical activity
6672352 people are living longer but this study shows that excess weight can have a real impact on the quality of peoples lives which can reduce the benefit of those extra years we must do all we can to encourage older friends or relatives to build enjoyable exercise into their daily routine and develop good habits ourselves to take into our retirement years people can visit www strollbacktheyears info or www healthpromcornwall org 01209 313419 for more advice
6672353 with our technology we can image specific cells in real time with exquisite selectivity which allows us to track their location and movement and to count the apparent number of cells present we then use conventional mri to obtain a high resolution image that places the labeled cells in their anatomical context
6672354 the large background signal from mobile water and intrinsic tissue contrast differences can often make it challenging to unambiguously identify regions containing these metal ion labeled cells throughout the body which is the current state of the art
6672355 right now were using our technology to image key cell types involved in autoimmune diseases like type i diabetes but our cellular mri agents also can be adapted to label other cell types including cells from bone marrow and stem cells a key long term application of our technology is to label and monitor cell based therapeutics in humans

6672359 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6672360 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6672361 the claims about bullet voting in the dartmouth alumni election remind me that with a per voter average of voting for 1 8 candidates the proportion of bullet votes has to be fairly small the alternative as i mentioned in a communcation a day or two ago is that nearly everyone voted for one or three candidates but not two unlikely as that might be it would suggest that most of those who voted followed a strategy of either voting for the petition candidate or voting for all nominated candidates in which case richie s claim that the opposition was disorganized falls apart as does the claim by some of the alumni council people that in a 1 on 1 situation the petition candidate would been defeated
6672362 because approving a second choice may help defeat the voters first choice it is likely to devolve to typical vote for one plurality voting

6672370 bachchan told newspersons on the eve of the uk leg of the show unforgettable to be held at the o2 arena in london on sunday
6672371 we have taken up the cause of providing electricity in 100 villages across the world by feb 2009 and through this tour hopefully we will be able to contribute towards providing solar lantern to at least one village in india as the tour moves we would like to increase the number of villages that we can lend our support to
6672372 in an attempt to fight the global challenge of climate change the unforgettable stars and the the producers of the show wizcraft international entertainment pvt ltd have pledged their unflinching support to this worthy cause
6672373 usa and other developed countries might have caused global emission but all of us are victims and hence its time we take preventive measures
6672374 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6672375 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6672376 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6672377 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6672378 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6672379 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6672380 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6672381 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6672382 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6672383 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6672384 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6672385 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6672386 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6672387 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense

6672405 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6672406 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6672407 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6672408 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6672409 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6672410 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6672411 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6672412 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6672424 i havent seen any map that doesnt show pennsylvania is a true swing state in this election
6672425 in the fall i think there is going to be an expectation of city committee that just like in the kerry campaign and just like in the gore campaign there will be money moving into city committee for election day activity
6672426 i dont think its a contradiction of our message to work with people who also support senator obama
6672427 i think senator obama likes a big tent and were going to have an organization that helps us win philadelphia decisively
6672428 i remember when bill clinton came and he went out on 52nd and market he has to do that just to reassure his voters that he cares about their vote

6672442 metsos profitable growth strategy was launched in august 2005 our progress has been strong and we are reaching the financial targets set in october 2006 one year earlier than we estimated at the time
6672443 now it is time to accelerate the strategy execution by introducing a new operating structure and more ambitious financial targets

6672505 this is for the village elders to decide i will be happy to meet him in peace at home but i am now concentrating on worshipping the gods and praying for his victory once the match starts i will be glued to the television

6672514 i want somebody whos independent somebody who can push against my preconceived notions and challenge me so we have got a robust debate in the white house
6672515 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6672516 its been a good week the players have looked good and bright and we go into round two in a very positive frame of mind
6672517 there is honesty and reality around the team that we can do better and we will do better
6672518 it was good to get the season under way but we know we can do more right around the park and well be looking to do exactly that against melbourne
6672519 while the performance against queensland wasnt where we wanted it to be in its entirety there were times we got the ball into good areas and the goal by shane smeltz was a good one
6672520 we lacked a little bit of cohesion and if we can secure more of the ball in that middle third of the pitch against melbourne then we give ourselves much more of a chance once we get at them get the ball into the flank areas and utilise the pace of our players then we can cause them some problems just as we did in the final
6672521 we might play slightly differently to what we did against queensland with a bit of a tweak in formation to get more support forward into advance positions
6672522 so well be looking for a bit more patience and to use wide players on the ball to get at the full backs and exploit the spaces that melbourne can leave you
6672523 i think the front third can be a lot more exciting than what we saw last weekend fortunately weve got depth and quality this season and if we dont have leo and leilei available then there are chances for other players thats the desire i want to see around the club and at the weekend

6672525 weve had great success with enterprise repeats on monday night and theres an appetite for space opera as battlestar goes away
6672526 theres an opportunity to keep the space opera as part of our programming strategy
6672527 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
6672528 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
6672529 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories

6672542 his intellect was as much of a curse as it was a blessing
6672543 listen the performance lately has been a little rougher than anyone would like to go through
6672544 but we didnt make any bones about what we were going to do when we said we were going to go through a rebuilding
6672545 for people who watch the team on a day to day basis that might seem like a long way away but our goal first and foremost was to rebuild our system and we have done that im very pleased by that very pleased when i see the young players we have in our system to go from where we were this time last year to where we are now is amazing
6672546 ive seen all of their minor league guys and believe me when i say this billy did a good thing
6672547 of all the organizations ive seen they have the best talent ive seen this year he has a plan
6672548 given the direction were going we thought it was the proper move at the time long term well benefit from it with the players we got
6672549 part of it is that we played so well before the break it seems like rebuilding happens overnight and it doesnt
6672550 last year we were in third place our payroll was growing beyond our means and we had no farm system now were in third place but have the system we wanted and our payroll has been reduced to the point that we have more flexibility to do some other things
6672551 were taking our licks right now but were going to come back next year and be unbelievable
6672552 when everyone here figures out what were doing we can pull off something like tampa bay has this year no one here should have their heads down
6672553 my ideal of a burglary detective is to be like a dog who is digging for a bone buried in the backyard
6672554 sometimes you have to start in the corner of the yard and dig up the whole yard to find that bone
6672555 here it is 12 years later and it is coming to a conclusion
6672556 even early on in the investigation some of our colleagues and even police from other police departments were very cynical about us pursuing this case and if wed get golder
6672557 that always stuck with me that if you keep going that eventually youll catch someone
6672558 as soon as i heard that i knew we werent chasing a ghost anymore
6672559 if jack hadnt died i dont think alan would have even gone to trial especially if he knew his brother would testify against him
6672560 i think he had a shred of morality and couldnt use and manipulate people and throw them away like alan did
6672561 he gave us a lot of direct information that would have been useful in a prosecution but it didnt happen that way
6672562 jack was in ill health from the day we met him
6672563 each of these guys has a signature that you can identify based on very specific things they do
6672564 any theory that those others were credible suspects was just baloney and we ruled them out

6672573 its fun to promote this sport and not just for the sake of money
6672574 you also want to give back to people if youre gonna do it youve got to do it for all the right reasons
6672575 for muslims its sunnet a cause for great celebration similar to confirmation or first communion for christians and bar mitzvah for jews before the operation the muslim lad is dressed in a special fancy suit of white satin with red decorations and paraded around the town with all his friends and relatives to the strains of wild music often provided by a live band after the operation which only takes a few minutes the proud parents host a big party for all their relatives and friends

6672584 its amazing that the amount of news that happens in the world every day always just exactly fits the newspaper
6672585 the two parties signed an agreement that said the judges will be restored within 24 hours of musharrafs impeachment
6672586 we honestly and sincerely want the coalition to work but the restoration of the judges was the central issue in our election campaign and if that is not respected then people will ask why are we clinging on to the coalition
6672587 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6672588 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6672589 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6672590 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6672591 they have defaulted on their promise three times and its putting us in an awkward position
6672592 the judges restoration issue is not as simple as mr sharif thinks

6672648 from day one i would tell him to do something and he would do it and then i would tell him it was not enough he did not understand it for the first part of the summer but by the middle of the summer i couldnt tell him what to do anymore because he was already doing it and that is what you look for in a guy that age
6672649 i just go out here and me being the oldest at least on the field as far as experience i just go out and try to show the younger guys what i know and what i learned from playing

6672666 maybe theyre discouraged depression and obesity are major concerns today too many young people feel thwarted by everything thats happening so fast around them that theyre not able to become contributing members of society
6672667 the runners in this event serve as an inspiration to individuals making a commitment to better health
6672668 these ambassadors prove that commitments to regular physical activity are attainable even despite various challenges we are honored to have so many wonderful role models participating in this event
6672669 id like to promote to our governor how important it is through different organizations that they provide grants and funding for the 15 michigan disability networks with the right people heading those up and reaching out it lessens the burden on society as a whole if people get connected with the right support group that can help them avoid obesity depression drugs and alcohol that come with escaping
6672670 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines

6672672 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
6672673 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep about 20 percent of adults in industrial countries have problems sleeping at one time or another the institute analysed scientific studies that cover a wide range of research on sleep and insomnia

6672682 something that is evidence based is much more amenable to large scale data collection large scale payment programs anything that is large
6672683 and psychoanalysis is a very individualistic thing it is the smallest enterprise one analyst and one patient trying to understand what has caused the patients suffering and how it can get better
6672684 the reason we do is because cognitive behavioral therapies are much more conducive to being researched im not in a position to say that we have a great deal of evidence that cognitive behavioral therapy is more effective than other approaches such as psychoanalysis
6672685 i dont know if doing a full rct of psychoanalysis is impossible but it seems almost impossible to me
6672686 there are certain kinds of treatments that just dont lend themselves to that kind of study so are you willing to accept a different kind of evidence like anecdotal studies or case studies
6672687 there are some medical economic interests that prefer to limit evidence to randomized controlled trials

6672691 they were wood and they were held together with a special glue they had to mix
6672692 it was so neat every time they opened one of these exhibits we got to go to the party
6672693 we got to go behind the scenes too where they kept the butterflies and the insects and the sharks teeth and in the taxidermy area
6672694 he was a great example of a leader when he could lead
6672695 he was the breadwinner the father figure we were very much a leave it to beaver family
6672696 and then as he grew older he mellowed a little bit more

6672701 i chose webb air force base for my pilot training in 1972 because it was 80 miles from paint creek grand old buildings like this have an extraordinary story to tell but this is not just about a building
6672702 its about good neighbors who go out and strip somebodys cotton when they have something go rough and tough in their life its a reflection of our spirit of individualism as texans and a celebration of family and friends
6672703 coming out of paint creek north of abilene in haskell county i thought this was the biggest building in texas
6672704 bringing the settles back into the glorious shape it was in in the 1930s and 40s is going to be a great asset
6672705 oh no we had 40s music with a local big band
6672706 it will give us an opportunity to open up more businesses and bring more people downtown
6672707 i have looked at this building all the years ive been here and im so excited it will be refurbished
6672708 it will generate new jobs and do something for the attitude and morale of the community to see this building restored
6672709 hmm that is my house shit i guess i should slow down
6672710 the united states paid from 64 64 cents to 77 cents per ounce for domestic silver which had a market value of 45 cents
6672711 performance share fees are volatile largely in line with absolute investment returns platinum said
6672712 in the short term management fees may decline further it said
6672713 performance share fees are earned in the calendar year and with half of that passed and with absolute performance for the first six months being minus nine per cent it is difficult to foresee given current market conditions any performance fees being earned for 2008 09
6672714 for an investment management company such as platinum to forecast earnings requires view of the future dependent on a number of unknown variables it said
6672715 additionally it requires us to fund flows for which we have no sound methodology on which to base a prediction it said
6672716 accordingly your board will not be offering earnings forecasts a corker too dear to drink

6672733 lehman brothers the beleaguered us investment bank held secret talks to sell up to 50 per cent of its shares to south korean or chinese parties in the first week of august but failed to reach agreement with either the south koreans and chinese walked away after concluding that lehman was asking too high a price said new york based people familiar with the potential buyers lehman declined to comment
6672734 the talks reflect the growing pressure on dick fuld lehmans chief executive to raise capital ahead of the mid september earnings report which analysts said could include more writedowns of 4bn 2bn bringing the total so far to 12bn
6672735 in addition to selling a stake in itself lehman is considering selling all or part of its holdings including its troubled 40bn commercial real estate portfolio and its asset management arm which includes neuberger berman analysts said the asset management arm was the crown jewel that could be worth up to 10bn
6672736 in the first week of august lehman held parallel talks with the government owned korea development bank and chinas citic securities at its headquarters in new yorks times square area
6672737 the two parties signed an agreement that said the judges will be restored within 24 hours of musharrafs impeachment
6672738 we honestly and sincerely want the coalition to work but the restoration of the judges was the central issue in our election campaign and if that is not respected then people will ask why are we clinging on to the coalition
6672739 if the judges are not restored we will perhaps be forced to sit in the opposition
6672740 we will not try to bring the government down but of course then we have no choice but to sit in the opposition
6672741 we will definitely try our outmost to ensure that they will not pull out because we have promised to work together to serve the country
6672742 if they want to do something in haste they have all the right to do that we cannot force them to be with us but we are trying to reach a consensus
6672743 they have defaulted on their promise three times and its putting us in an awkward position
6672744 the judges restoration issue is not as simple as mr sharif thinks

6672771 pilgrimage walk for justice and freedom of pastor berlin guerrero
6672772 we believe that god is just and that our lives are in gods hands so we are praying for the freedom of pastor berlin guerrero however we are also very concerned that with the recent corruption allegations in the court of appeals pastor berlin may not get a fair hearing on his pending case we are here to remind justices and citizens alike that we remain vigilant in pastor berlins case and that all are accountable to god for our conduct
6672773 we are dismayed that the process is taking so long every day that pastor berlin is detained is another day that justice is denied to him we understand in new ways what languishing in jail is one of our vibrant church workers is doing his best to minister to other prisoners in the jail but he could be more productive if he were given his due freedom his family and church members are unduly suffering his absence as well justice delayed is justice denied
6672774 and now we have to worry about the corruption scandal allegations facing the court of appeals and the potential distraction or implications this may have on pastor berlins case it is very hard to attain justice but we will do our utmost to keep the attention of the court on his case our prayer for pastor berlins freedom must be matched by our best actions to appeal for justice
6672775 as we walk in faith we need to stop search think reflect open pray because when we stop the more we see jesus the more we deepen our relationship with him and as we walk with others the more we bring others to jesus the more we walk happily to jesus

6672814 initially scanning electron microscopy sem conducted at another laboratory showed high silicon and oxygen signals that led them to conclude that the spores were a weaponized form says kotula
6672815 the possible misinterpretation of the sem results arose because microanalysis in the sem is not a surface sensitive tool
6672816 because a spore body can be 1 5 to 2 microns wide by 1 micron long a sem cannot localize the elemental signal from whole spore bodies
6672817 lacked that fuzzy outer coating that would indicate that theyd been weaponized

6672841 whilst the concerns are clearly valid the situation need not be so if ngos and the psc community worked out better ways of working together and cooperating in such theatres rather than one group eyeing the other with suspicion and nervous aprehension
6672842 i think you have a decent point that there are misunderstandings between the ngo and psc sectors
6672843 moreover ngos and pscs are not the only players involved you have to remember the local communities they operate in for instance in afghanistan local people often have dim view of pscs that cannot simply be chalked up to suspicion they have very valid reasons for being nervous including the impunity with which contractors operate the lack of sensitivity to local conditions the lack of command and control over pscs and the privileging of the clients security over that of the public good for more on this see the swiss peace foundations report http www swisspeace ch typo3 fileadmin user upload pdf working paper wp 1 2008 pdf

6672861 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve

6672868 onepoint mobile surveys enable us to offer an alternative way for our various stakeholders specifically the public to engage with us which is a key focus for the council as involving the public in our work is an integral part of the policy making process
6672869 overall we were impressed with the simplicity of the service yet the real pluses for us were that with onepoint survey participants dont incur any costs as the text messages are free to send and receive and that we have the ability to view the results instantly as soon as they come in allows us to keep our finger on the pulse which aids quicker decision making
6672870 the use of mobile phone surveys within local authorities offers significant benefits across many different areas response rates are higher and faster than other methodologies and respondents continue to favour it as a way of communicating as responses can be given at a time and place that is convenient to them

6672886 setiap kolam yang lengkap dengan 12 sistem penapis dan kondo ikan boleh memuatkan sehingga 300 ekor ikan ketutu

6672897 projek penternakan keli afrika kami mula menampakkan hasil april lalu apabila seorang pengusaha dari kampung gagu jelebu menyertai aktiviti ini diikuti dua lagi dari kuala pilah dengan jumlah keseluruhan 28 kolam
6672898 melalui modal sebanyak itu sudah boleh memulakan projek dan kami akan membantu memastikan projek berjalan baik serta mampu meraih keuntungan selain membekalkan peralatan dan benih ikan pengusaha akan dibimbing dan dilatih dari segi pengurusan makanan penjagaan serta pemasaran ikan
6672899 ini bermakna setiap pengusaha berpeluang meraih antara rm3 000 hingga rm4 000 bagi empat kolam yang bersaiz 20 x 40 kaki jangan bimbang mengenai kadar kematian anak ikan kerana setakat ini ia hanya sekitar 10 peratus
6672900 selaku pihak bertanggungjawab terhadap pengusaha kami akan memastikan mereka mematuhi peraturan dari segi menyediakan makanan ikan dan proses pertukaran air kolam untuk memastikan tumbesaran ternakan tidak terbantut
6672901 baru baru ini kami mengadakan kursus di kolej komuniti jelebu disertai 37 peserta dari negeri sembilan dan melaka sehingga awal julai syarikat sudah menandatangani perjanjian dengan 52 peserta yang berhasrat untuk melaksanakan projek ini
6672902 projek ini berdaya maju kerana ada pengusaha mampu meraih sehingga rm4 000 sebulan matlamat kami adalah menggalakkan seramai mungkin mengusahakan projek ini kerana ia berpotensi besar mudah diuruskan serta risiko rendah manakala permintaan semakin meningkat terutama daripada peniaga ikan keli salai

6672923 the general approach to looking at organizational performance is fine through comparative case studies is fine it needs to focus perhaps on market penetration product competitiveness cost etc customer favors ability toward product and services costs

6672938 while there is understandable caution among retailers the world over we remain confident that our multi brand multi region business model will deliver healthy growth and our forward orders support this view
6672939 a very pleasing result in any climate let alone in the prevailing economic conditions
6672940 this again demonstrates the resilience of our business model and the heightened global demand for the groups brands
6672941 the outlook going forward for 2009 were saying the market is a difficult market were saying the market conditions are probably the worst anyone has seen for a long period of time chief executive greg goodman said
6672942 but we are comfortable and confident of targeting eps growth in 2009 of 6 per cent and that is subject to no material deterioration in the market from where we sit at the moment
6672943 this result is largely due to organic growth mr goodman said
6672944 we have 371 investment properties under management and 97 developments globally giving us the benefit of significant geographic and earnings diversity
6672945 this has enabled us to navigate through a difficult period while no one can forecast when broader market conditions will improve we believe that our business is in good shape to operate through the current cycle

6672952 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6672953 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6672954 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6672955 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later

6672995 this research will enable the industry here one of the biggest wine exporters in the world to understand the carbon cost they pose to the environment this is crucial to maintaining south africas competitive position in global fruit and wine export markets in order to continue to employ local people
6672996 there is international pressure from consumers worldwide who want to know what the carbon footprint of produce brought in supermarkets is this study is about satisfying requirements in a market that is becoming increasingly difficult
6672997 they forecast trends but we have to do the research for the right reasons
6672998 we have to measure where we are in terms of our environmental impact and determine a way forward we have to act from a position of knowledge
6672999 the research will benefit commercial as well as small scale farmers

6673012 do not be afraid of the word authority believing things on authority only means believing them because you have been told them by someone you think trustworthy ninety nine percent of the things you believe are believed on authority i believe there is such a place as new york i have not seen it myself i could not prove by abstract reasoning that there must be such a place i believe it because reliable people have told me so every historical statement in the world is based on authority none of us has seen the norman conquest or the defeat of the armada none of us could prove them by pure logic as you prove a thing in mathematics we believe them simply because people who did see them have left writings that tell us about them in fact on authority a man who jibbed at authority in other things as some people do in religion would have to be content to know nothing all his life
6673013 superstition recurs in a rationalist age because it rests on something which if not identical with rationalism is not unconnected with skepticism it is at least very clearly connected with agnosticism but it is an agnostic sentiment for it rests on two feelings first that we do not really know the laws of the universe and second that they may be very different to all we call reason

6673016 the once every four years hope for the lever pull sensation of democratic power blinds people to the opportunities for democratic representation deliberation activism and change that surrounds us in local elections
6673017 bad for democracy how the presidency undermines the power of the people
6673018 even the best presidents need social movements to accomplish transformational change
6673019 it is in vain to summon a people which has been rendered so dependent on the central power to choose from time to time the representatives of that power
6673020 this rare and brief exercise of their free choice however important it may be will not prevent them from gradually losing the faculties of thinking feeling and acting for themselves and thus gradually falling below the level of humanity

6673032 we have passed the second inspection and have been forecast a dry day
6673033 weve had top spot for a little bit and australia have taken it back
6673034 it has been because of the success weve had around the world for the past couple of years its reward for that and we really want to improve our game
6673035 i would like to think if we had been playing a fair amount of one day cricket coming into the series everything would roll smoothly
6673036 our battle is to get into the series in the first couple of games to get our standards up to the level we know we are capable of
6673037 we are pretty undercooked considering the cricket we have played
6673038 we are favourites in terms of what we have achieved over a period of time and that is fair enough but as a team our feet are firmly on the ground in terms of what we need to do to be successful here
6673039 it has been very difficult to maintain the levels the last week and a bit has been very slow and more mentally draining rather than anything else trying to find things to do
6673040 it is fair to say the guys are thinking a bit about home but there are battles still ahead
6673041 we are waiting to find out we are hoping like england that the right decision is made
6673042 the rough thing for all teams is that we are so close to a major tournament and no one knows what is going on
6673043 it is probably not looking good for him at the moment
6673044 i guess we will have to see where he is by the weekend and see whether or not he will progress
6673045 last year i was on cloud nine the whole year i remember last year coming back after the summer break and i was still floating
6673046 this weekend i have my feet on the ground ive not done anything crazy over the last two weeks just relaxed
6673047 i know what i have to do and that is to hit this race hard
6673048 i was looking at my results from last year and for the first nine or 12 races it was quite unreal added hamilton
6673049 who knows we might have that another year but i think this year everyone has pretty much had the same sort of run especially us guys at the front
6673050 we are all pushing very very hard its a closer season than it was last year
6673051 all the teams are perhaps pushing even more to the edge and thats where you really see mistakes starting to happen
6673052 this year there are lots of opportunities to make mistakes and there are also lots of unknowns new circuits lots of different things with the car
6673053 it was roasting i was sweating my arse off just walking around smiled hamilton
6673054 but they the organisers have done a really good job it doesnt remind me of any circuit i have seen
6673055 it is just completely different to any circuit i have ever been to
6673056 people are saying it is like monaco but its nothing like monaco its three times faster
6673057 they are a team we generally do quite well against
6673058 but theyre a really good team and they can put the sword to anybody if you let them what you have to do is try and get them in an arm wrestle
6673059 its been a bit of a frustrating injury but we think weve got to the bottom of it hes practised all week with us
6673060 he makes a difference to us and coming into the play offs you want your best players on deck
6673061 we are confident that we are making good progress and putting the foundations in place for the challenges that are ahead of us
6673062 foundations is a word that we have been using a lot recently the team know we need to do everything possible in training and in our remaining games to make sure that we are ready for the play offs
6673063 we need to up our performance level from last week at wigan tonight
6673064 we havent done ourselves justice in the last couple of games particularly and this is a chance for us to do that
6673065 it is important we improve our performances of late and the way to do that is by doing the basics correctly

6673129 we have not been able to locate the mother we have exhausted all calls and leads that have come to us there have been in excess of 30
6673130 they all petered out to nothing the autopsy results are inconclusive and unless information comes forward to suggest who the mother is it will go through to an inquest
6673131 i thought she may have needed medical attention and i would be surprised if she had done so and a doctor had not bothered to tell anybody
6673132 a lot of our work is driven by and relies on assistance from the community if people are prepared to ring up and give us information to go on we follow it up
6673133 the investigation is ongoing and we appeal to anyone who may know who she is to contact crimestoppers
6673134 otherwise it will go to inquest but we need to discuss those issues with the coroner the direction the job is going to take and how they want to handle it as the coroner makes the finding

6673186 today i received a phone call from stratovarius mainman timo tolkki
6673187 he sounded like being in a very confused state of mind and was talking about red kabbalah ribbons and how when he was reading madonnas biography he felt warm waves all over his body and that the spirit of jesus entered him and that now he really has found something he has been searching for all his life
6673188 i am very worried about him he sounded like completely crazy
6673189 from this day onwards i will not take the responsibility of whatever is being released on this website
6673190 as long as my paycheck arrives i will continue putting on the site whatever tolkki asks me to put there
6673191 i really need to share this with all of you
6673192 2 days ago i had a panic attack i lied down and tried to relax
6673193 then a voice in my head told me repeatedly kabbalah kabbalah kabbalah
6673194 it was about the teachings of kabbalah i believe i have now found the complete and only universal truth i understand that none of the things in my life matters really it is all an illusion anyway

6673199 at the same time that the souls outer dimension reflects the configuration of the sefirot the inner dimension of the soul reflects the infinite light that illuminates the sefirot
6673200 from the perspective of mans service of g d these levels of soul may be described as five ascending levels of awareness of and communion with g d
6673201 i can announce that i am talking to timo tolkki and actively trying to come to terms with what happened between us

6673252 we sincerely hope this gift will help create a little sense of normalcy for the children in the gulf coast and minnesota who have been affected by this natural disaster
6673253 no doubt children are the most vulnerable victims of hurricane katrina and often the most resilient in order to protect and nurture our most precious commodity one of the easiest and most effective tools to allow them to deal with these events is through play
6673254 we applaud the immediacy and generosity of manhattan toy for getting toys into the hands of these children giving them a great outlet for fun and healing
6673255 one of the basic premises of girl scouting is to make the world a better place we are so proud of the response of our girl scout troops to the survivors of hurricane katrina

6673270 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomc s kick in
6673271 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
6673272 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that it s leading to premature cell deterioration
6673273 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6673274 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6673275 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6673276 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6673277 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines

6673294 probably have more experience than our new ceo would have
6673295 being in the community for so long were in a position to talk to members of the community whenever we run into them
6673296 its a tremendous asset for our community and fairly important that it stays as a viable institution
6673297 in order to have up to date equipment and excellent physicians and services we need to support the hospital
6673298 our role as board members is to try and guide the hospital in its decisions and we obviously feel like the hospitals a critical part of our community
6673299 the existence with current payments we receive from medicare and insurance companies today are really not sufficient to sustain the hospital we just think it would be tragic if it were no longer here
6673300 believe me the people working here arent going to stand by and watch that happen
6673301 its an important stage because whoever wins will represent the state of nevada at speaking engagements and special events

6673305 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6673306 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6673307 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6673308 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6673309 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document

6673324 it will make us one of the largest graduators of nursing baccalaureates in california
6673325 we are doing this after looking at the shortage and recognizing that the shortage is only going to increase over time
6673326 it helps us out a great deal that were disposing of things properly and its a good deed to return them to somebody who might possibly use them
6673327 if were inclined to spend 72 000 we should spend it on the city where we live not a location way down the line on the other side of 95
6673328 its not our burden if the county wants us to take it over
6673329 this may not be that prohibitively expensive for us to do

6673357 its always been hard to use miles to get flights when i want to fly so i usually just put down 30 000 miles and the restrictions go out the door

6673525 i first got the idea to do the film when i visited the plain of jars in laos in 2002
6673526 you could still see the craters from the air bombing and unexploded ordnance was everywhere
6673527 then i heard about long chen and the fact that no one had got there since the war and i thought how do i visit and how do i make a film about it
6673528 i found it bizarre that at one time this was the second biggest city in laos and it was completely secret
6673529 laos was the progenitor of the way america fights wars in the 21st century
6673530 outsourcing the war to private companies gathering public support by falsifying intelligence and documents embedded journalism and automated warfare including the use of so called smart weapons all these methods were first tested in laos
6673531 the cia had just declassified a whole lot of material so that helped as well
6673532 the most important source was the guys who were over there filming with their little super 8 cameras often illegally
6673533 we destroyed a whole civilisation we wiped it off the map we incinerated atomised human remains in this air war and what happened in the end we lost
6673534 after we went another uk crew tried to get there but they were caught and deported
6673535 there are some places in the world that have a different energy and long chen is one of these you look down the runway and think this is the place were it all happened the planes took off from here and bombed all those people
6673536 its just an army outpost now a small village a couple of hundred people soldiers and their families
6673537 the golden age of long chen is over it used to be the high tech oasis for spooks in laos there were allegedly more antennas there than trees now they do not even have power
6673538 there are still some groups but they are not organised they are certainly not politically or militarily organised they are remnants the children and grandchildren of those involved in the war who are scared to come out of the jungle because they have never known anything else
6673539 whether vang pao is guilty or not of the charges he is facing one thing that is true is that he and other expatriate hmong have used these people as pawns
6673540 vang pao has also got millions of dollars out of the hmong community in the u s under the guise of liberating their homeland
6673541 i do not see that happening in the next few years it is still far too sensitive on the part of the lao government
6673542 they are also keen not to risk unsettling relations with the americans by opening it up
6673543 but i cant picture us still being beatles when were 30 years old
6673544 when we opened in 69 the average age of our clients was 23 today its probably around 27 and thats taking a lot of people whove been listing their age as 25 for the last six or seven years at their word
6673545 ive never thought that much about age i mean ive always really liked chuck berry and he must be closing in on 50 by now
6673546 i dont think anybody would get real upset if they found out ill be 30 in a couple of weeks but why take a chance
6673547 shell kill me if you print this but our drummer is
6673548 did you see dave edmunds and rockpile at the roxy a couple of months ago or carl perkins at the whisky i didnt hear anybody calling them too old did you you could put four 59 year old men together and if they rocked like that nobody would call them old
6673549 throughout history men have been reaching their peaks at around 33 look at mozart and alexander the great and jesus if only people under 30 were allowed to play it it would be rocks loss
6673550 a couple of times when i was broke i had to join groups that were more like 9 to 5 punch in punch out jobs than music
6673551 but everybody kept asking me why i wasnt playing until i realized that i wasnt being true to my school as the beach boys would say that playing the guitar is what im really around to do
6673552 this is the last group ill ever be in full time if we dont get signed im going to find myself a nice well paying probably deathly boring job and live comfortably again ive done enough starving

6673559 the chicago music scene was very exciting its such a big city and it was very welcoming but the portland music scene is great
6673560 theres a lot of people who play a similar kind of music and the label im on hush has a lot of really nice people on it
6673561 that really built my sound i feel like they really added a lot to how the last record sounded
6673562 i was moving for some of the time while i was writing those and i was in a new relationship also so there were a lot of things to write about there was leaving friends and a new love
6673563 my friends and i would do a correspondence sort of like a blog called the getalong one moved to southern illinois and one moved to la and one stayed in chicago and i moved to portland so that song is really about just moving away and keeping in touch
6673564 as many have shared that similar experience of attempting to stay connected to friends i try to do a mix of biographical and general
6673565 which took nearly two years from idea to release i feel different because im very settled now i live in a house now and i just feel more stable

6673737 since ive been back what ive most thought about is this remember how we got out onto those plains and mandaa explained that there were no property lines that there was no such thing as trespassing
6673738 ultimately when i listen to these songs on these mongolian cds and i think back to those rides across the steppe i think about how i was so happy because i was worried about riding and eating and watching and not about paperwork and deadlines and car inspections and trespassing etc ive thought a lot about how there will always be worry in this life but i guess it comes down to what youre worried about falling off a horse among good people or having all the necessary insurance among greedy assholes

6673742 just knowing kobe i know hes going to take this kind of personally
6673743 anybody who has aspirations to be a champion you understand that theres a sense of pride that comes along with beating a champion
6673744 it came down to the last shot of the semifinals which felt like it was the gold medal game
6673745 you kind of forgot that we played france for the gold medal
6673746 weve played all the best teams in the tournament and were going to beat them all
6673747 were being humble of course but we need to be confident if were not confident we have no chance
6673748 i think the struggles been a great thing because were not coming into this underestimating anything
6673749 i think its been a blessing in disguise really because you get to the semifinals and you kind of focus on the gold medal game to be honest with you this time were not doing that
6673750 06 was a different situation now were in the perfect situation its a perfect story for us this is a team that we were going to have to come across either in the gold medal game or on our way to the gold medal game here they are right now

6673763 our knowledge regarding what happens to the body with age is really changing
6673764 it used to be that the gold standard for physical performance was 20 but now you have people who are continuing to train and are pushing the age curve up
6673765 i liken it to a pianist who has done very deliberate practice for 50 years that individual will know exactly what is needed to perform the piece
6673766 the older athlete is aware of how his or her body has changed with age and will anticipate what is needed to perform
6673767 we are learning that exercise actually reverses some basic aspects of aging at the molecular level
6673768 exercise doesnt just make muscles stronger it makes muscles younger
6673769 our goal is to be able to take a biopsy from the quadriceps muscle from someone who is 50 for example and to know whether the person has the muscle of someone younger or older
6673770 we had legitimate questions at the beginning of our research
6673771 was running on hard surfaces going to cause the knees to age prematurely and would the body in general fall apart from too much abuse and overtake any health benefits that occur in the short term
6673772 there is increased importance placed on the role of recovery on giving a body rest
6673773 older athletes should not train seven days a week if youre 40 you can perform like youre 25 but you cant train like youre 25
6673774 a lot of exercise being done now comes from exercises once done for rehabilitation after an injury
6673775 ten years ago core training that focuses on strengthening the torso didnt exist pilates yoga bridges on the floor stability balls
6673776 michael phelps knew which days he would need to be at his absolute best
6673777 so his trainers created a routine working back from his competition date
6673778 at the games in italy youd see all of these wiry gray haired people in their warm ups running and jumping
6673779 you see how active they are running does retard the aging process and thats no small thing

6673788 georgian president mikhail saakashvili sought to designate the secessionist movements in south ossetia and abkhazia as terrorists a convenient brand that would give him little opposition from western governments as they conduct their own war on terror as a result he believed that by increasing georgian confrontation with the two regions he would get western support and a russian government on the sidelines he gambled he lost

6673823 die bisherige saison kommt mir ganz anders vor als die vor einem jahr damals spielte konstanz eine gro e rolle diesmal erzielten die top fahrer ganz unterschiedliche ergebnisse
6673824 jeder fahrer der mindestens ein rennen gewann holte mindestens zweimal keine punkte
6673825 gute ergebnisse sind deshalb umso wichtiger und bis zum ende der saison wird auch die konstanz wichtiger werden am wichtigsten wird es sein immer in die punkte zu fahren
6673826 ich denke die strecke abzugehen oder abzufahren bringt mehr als ein simulator

6673857 una volta che sulle foreste mondiali cominceranno ad arrivare i soldi versati in cambio del carbonio ci si comincer a chiedere se i veri proprietari degli alberi sono quelli che pagano per salvarli oppure le comunit locali
6673858 tutti questi progetti hanno implicazioni rilevanti per la gestione delle foreste e per quello che risulterebbe lecito o illecito al loro interno le societ del carbonio tentano gi i primi approcci con le comunit locali proponendo degli accordi in base ai quali anche loro otterrebbero dei crediti di carbonio questo molto preoccupante

6673868 oprah has told the editors at o magazine shes tired of being on the cover every month its a pain
6673869 it takes a lot of time and energy and shes sick of it shes given them six months to figure out what to do without her

6673874 i have nothing to hide i didnt do anything wrong ive brought this here for you to see
6673875 i begged them to let me ride i didnt go looking for a fancy lawyer or high powered pr people i just wanted to come here to explain
6673876 once we were informed of the positive finding our first reaction was to work out how it had come about
6673877 we established it was contained in a product called equi block which denis uses commonly during warm up
6673878 denis has worked hard to get here and his preparations have been no different to anything he has done in any previous competitions
6673879 it seems to be an extremely severe punishment that he is not allowed to jump tonight given that he has been tested before without any problems
6673880 this is just one of many substances for which horses were being screened
6673881 denis uses it on the lower back of his horse as part of his normal warm up routine
6673882 denis took it out of his tack box and showed it to me he uses it to loosen muscles in the lower back of the horse and he has used it since he got lantinus for the entire year
6673883 this was a big surprise today denis was so certain that it was not a problem that he didnt draw it to my attention thats not unreasonable because he has been using it for a long time and there have no positive test results for this substance up until these olympic games
6673884 i invite you to come up and put this on your own skin if you were hoping to sensitise a horse with it then you would be looking for you money back
6673885 my biggest fear was for the system and the programme because thats what supports the boxers and i was afraid that that might be pulled down
6673886 everything was being questioned but hand on heart i never felt i was under pressure because we always believed that we were in this battle alone the team was a very tight unit we were looking at our mistakes and our frailties and as long as we were doing that we knew we were looking at the solutions too
6673887 we used run on derrynane beach in the morning at the back of
6673888 that was the only thing i felt proud about going by that house every morning but we were left to prepare on our own spar with each other sure we were mates were never going to kill each other you know what i mean youre not going to push
6673889 the training they do the commitment they put in giving up their lives their education putting everything on hold to try and be an olympian and do well out of it
6673890 five points up with six minutes to go beaten by a point
6673891 threw my hurley down that day and said im going to go to the olympic games f k this
6673892 if you dont take a risk you dont achieve and weve been taking risks for the last five years we failed on a number of occasions we went down in the gutter and thats probably whats made us what we are now
6673893 i want to do international relations in dcu and i worked extremely hard and put in the hours
6673894 i think the system should rank merit over a means test people of all backgrounds who work hard enough ought to be able to earn their place
6673895 the reintroduction of fees will just place unnecessary financial stress on the families of hardworking students
6673896 you can have wealthy farmers getting grants while other people cant even get childcare i dont trust means testing
6673897 i am opposed to the fees but also to the constant raising of registration fees
6673898 registration fees are currently close to e1 000 and the government is doing nothing to stop them going up every year
6673899 in 2004 the government commissioned a major organisation for economic co operation and development oecd review of higher education
6673900 the oecd report contained a wide range of recommendations including the return of individual student contributions
6673901 in making this recommendation the oecd reflected on the fact that top performing higher education systems internationally rely on diversified income sources
6673902 given the changed economic circumstances minister okeeffe has indicated that the re introduction of third level fees will now be considered
6673903 however the minister has emphasised that any proposal to reintroduce fees would have to be based on ability to pay and fees would not be imposed on low income families
6673904 over the past few weeks we have steadily heard a rising chorus of calls for the reintroduction of fees
6673905 it appears from comments made by the minister for education that the government is now about to capitulate to the pressure
6673906 the abolition of fees by the labour party opened up third level education to tens of thousands of students from low and middle income families
6673907 at a time when we want to encourage more students to enter third level it would be shortsighted to impose what would essentially be a tax on those hoping to get a degree
6673908 its a dog okay you can get another one relax
6673909 the real voyage of discovery consists not in making new landscapes but in having new eyes
6673910 i play a guy named curtis plummer whos really down and out
6673911 hes given up in a lot of ways his mother died a couple years ago and now all he does is hang out in the park drinking and reminiscing about the good ol days through taking care of his niece giving him some responsibility as well as the game of football it kind of brings him back from the dead to being a self respecting man
6673912 that is really what makes this worth making a movie about anybody can make believe something like this weve seen princess quarterback back in the day
6673913 but this is true story about real people football is just really the backdrop of this movie this movie is about two people getting themselves off the deck building their self esteem back and in the process building their community back
6673914 those two things made me want to be a part of it
6673915 especially because it was so inspiring a young girl going to the national pop warner championship on an all male football team that is a story that needs to be told and i wanted to be a part of that
6673916 its been a long shot to make it in the rap game
6673917 and going from doing that to making a movie like this and being accepted and it being now normal and not such a novelty thing thats a long shot
6673918 im originally from chicago and my whole family drove four days and three nights to california to help me with acting i definitely think that was a long shot
6673919 i knew a bit about it because my dad watches it but i wasnt a huge fan of it or anything like that
6673920 so i went out to louisiana where they filmed the movie i was coming in fresh learning everything i could about the sport i got the mechanics and got my feet down and everything came together
6673921 once i knew keke could do it i was very relieved
6673922 i knew the acting would be perfect but i was a little worried about if she could throw the football or not
6673923 i know people who have given up on life so i drew from the guys i would see not hanging out not really having any plans for their future
6673924 i drew on that more than the real guy we just wanted to have a guy take him from the bottom and give him purpose and put him back on top

6674046 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out
6674047 we wanted to have an environment where patients felt like they are in the desert many people find peace and calm in tucsons environment
6674048 everything about the building is a respect and a nod that pays homage to the desert environment that surrounds it
6674049 there is a huge body of research in the neurosciences that shows when patients are stressed they dont heal
6674050 were passionate about our patients and we wanted a better environment for them to receive their care
6674051 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6674052 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6674053 im very relieved although i never really thought the law was going to be enforceable against me

6674056 his web site is like a streetside table used to disseminate anti war and political messages in a variety of ways including displaying and selling his message bearing t shirts
6674057 the nations debt to its fallen soldiers may not be paid by giving their families a toll on free speech the debt must be paid but in other ways
6674058 for the free speech rights of all political activists in arizona regardless of how controversial or unpopular their message might be

6674065 i had tried to have them shifted to a more responsible entity some time ago
6674066 this recent development just brings it to the front burner
6674067 i would like to see a complete package with any pertinent information since they were formed
6674068 i want to know from the principal person kennedy the details they are not on the internet or available publicly shine a light on this and tell us all
6674069 there hasnt been much activity from ddc for many many years
6674070 unfortunately the ddc activities have been very low key if any at all

6674075 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6674076 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6674077 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6674078 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6674159 dialogue between a u s government agency and its citizens
6674160 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
6674161 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6674162 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6674163 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6674164 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6674165 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6674166 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6674167 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6674168 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6674169 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6674170 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6674171 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6674172 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6674173 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6674174 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6674175 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6674176 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6674177 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6674178 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6674179 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6674180 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6674181 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6674182 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6674183 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6674184 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6674185 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6674186 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6674187 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
6674188 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
6674189 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
6674190 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
6674191 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
6674192 quis propor um caminho um poss vel futuro ao teatro musical brasileiro
6674193 o p blico poder saborear um leque de imagens e sonhos peculiares ao teatro musical uma coisa que a cultura da televis o jogou para escanteio
6674194 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6674195 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6674196 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6674197 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6674198 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
6674199 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6674200 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
6674201 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
6674202 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6674203 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6674204 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
6674205 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
6674206 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
6674207 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
6674208 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits

6674210 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6674211 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6674212 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6674213 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
6674214 sandilands is having a real dominance in the ruck and from that their clearances have improved as well
6674215 certainly troy simmonds and tristan cartledge our ruckmen have really got to be strong this week against sandilands not to give him the dominance in the ruck to allow their midfield area to clean up around the stoppages

6674225 in light of the tightening polls does barack obama now have to go negative against john mccain
6674226 obama hasnt been doing the safe thing throughout this whole election
6674227 thats what i prefer to do especially for myself but also the team when theres two halves calling the shots i can just float around and do what i do
6674228 i think thats when we play our best when weve got the two halves named there
6674229 last week and weeks in the past ive played a bit of fullback and then had to play in the halves when weve only had one other half or five eighth there
6674230 with bedds me and the two halves on the field at the same time i think its going to be good for us
6674231 if we make the semis were going to be seventh or eighth and were going to be playing one of those sides anyway
6674232 you certainly dont want to be winning any wooden spoon theyll be trying to rip in these last three games
6674233 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission

6674237 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve

6674257 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6674260 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6674261 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6674262 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6674263 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6674264 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6674265 who are open to doing something on the production side
6674266 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue

6674283 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels

6674362 working on the family farm gives me a bit of flexibility to go on tour
6674363 i played drums for about nine years i thought i was going to be a drummer thats what i wanted to do after school but i wasnt playing in a band for a while and i enjoyed writing songs so it was just the next step really it was very different to step up to a microphone and sing rather then just being secure behind a drum kit so that took a little while to get use to but i eventually found out that its more fun
6674364 i was really nervous i had a book down in front of me because i couldnt remember all the lyrics but it was in front of all our friends and they were supportive and encouraging so it was fun
6674365 i was just more confident on the drums i could play a beat and get away with it but with singing theres no room for errors so i think its more a vulnerability thing
6674366 theres a lot of themes in the album where sometimes life doesnt go the way we want it to but in the end it kind of works out
6674367 we hired a guitar amp for the day and once we set it up it just exploded on us
6674368 it was really good leaving the studio each day knowing the songs were coming to life
6674369 when we recorded our ep we were still young still figuring out our sound and i was still learning as a songwriter so i think with the album we have really found our feet and the songs are a bit more mature and creative
6674370 it was a huge process we had a string orchestral arrangement and a choir come in to do parts on the album we wanted this album to be as big as we could get it we wanted there to be really anthemic and heartfelt songs
6674371 i guess you can say we are kind of childish and like to have a lot of fun we dont take things too seriously
6674372 the actual name came from the movie butch cassidy and the sundance kid and our guitarist luke his parents went and saw that movie for the first time when they were dating
6674373 i would have to say suresh our drummer hes the second oldest in the band but hes still probably the most childish
6674374 but were all little kids if that doesnt sound too cheesy

6674383 im not going to ask you to clarify what kind of business youre conducting in a tavern
6674384 you might be surprised parson it was a good meeting we made lots of progress this economy is really having an effect on us you know were still searching to find ways of saving money
6674385 i noticed you were quick to make some cuts in certain areas
6674386 didnt you folks just cut the budget for services to the mentally ill
6674387 look parson dont get huffy with me we have to cut things somewhere there was a lot of excess in that department they can tighten their belt
6674388 you cut the mental services budget because the mentally ill are not in a position to protest you havent cut one damn thing from the privileges you give to the corporations you havent cut one dime from you own salaries or god help us if you cut the salary of an elected official you havent grounded that helicopter the governor flies around in so dont you even dare to talk to me about we have to begin somewhere if you want to begin somewhere begin with yourself
6674389 look parson i dont have to take this abuse from you
6674390 well shit howard how does it feel to be the one thats being abused
6674391 parson im a civil servant i just do what im told
6674392 howard ill accept that if you can honestly tell me when the meeting was in progress and the old senator from the rich suburbs suggested this cut in services to those who can least survive without it you said wait a minute thats not right
6674393 an immigration removal centre can never be a suitable place for children and we were dismayed to find cases of disabled children being detained and some children spending large amounts of time incarcerated
6674394 despite the efforts of centre staff prolonged detention was having a detrimental effect on the welfare and behaviour of children whose fear and distress was strongly reflected in our childrens interviews
6674395 children should be detained only in exceptional circumstances and then only for the shortest time necessary length of cumulative detention should be clearly and accurately recorded
6674396 significant concerns remain particularly the lack of activity for detainees which is a failure that we have identified across the immigration detainee estate
6674397 even more worrying was the plight of children detained for increasing periods of time and with insufficient provision to meet their needs
6674398 were determined to treat children within our immigration system with fairness and compassion thats why the majority stay in detention for a week or less
6674399 often children are only detained when their parents try to frustrate the removal process detention then becomes necessary to maintain a robust but fair asylum system
6674400 those with no right to be in the uk must return home and last year we removed a person every eight minutes
6674401 yet again there is scathing criticism of the detention of children
6674402 how much more evidence does the government need of the harm detaining children causes before it puts a stop to it once and for all
6674403 the impact on their well being as evidenced by their fear and distress noted by inspectors is simply unacceptable and the legacy of this experience will last well beyond their period of incarceration
6674404 we call for an immediate end to the deplorable practice of detaining children which we believe can never be justified
6674405 with the whole world watching the olympic games have captured the imagination of the whole global community

6674423 after the second accident happened it piqued my interest a little bit
6674424 to be in the same area it threw a flag up
6674425 youre going to see a more even racetrack all the way around
6674426 i think its going to be a good kind surface
6674427 it could have been a lot of different things i guess it happened so quickly
6674428 we kind of knew that going into examining the cushion but in case there was something we wanted to peel that surface off and look
6674429 through that process we went ahead and bladed some of the surface more to the outside where the horses dont use it
6674430 youre never going to stop accidents totally in this business
6674431 but corrective maintenance will always minimize your chances of something happening
6674432 its been great because ive had a big turnaround im still sticking with it
6674433 im just trying to keep working hard and keep listening to the coaches
6674434 theyve really helped me out its hard to believe somebody if youre not seeing results but im seeing results what theyre telling me is happening
6674435 i loved baseball that was the first sport i ever played
6674436 hes got hitters hands right now hes trying to find the right balance and the right timing and sometimes that takes awhile but as far as his hands go and his strength hes got a lot of potential
6674437 i just want to have an opportunity to play in the big leagues
6674438 you cant just say you want to be there because you have to have the opportunity first thats all i really want in three or four years to have that opportunity to have that shot
6674439 we will be sad to see big ted go you get used to him being in the living room but we wont miss him too much
6674440 we are hoping to buy a new motorbike or to get brandon a tv or a playstation
6674441 we have done all we can and the fire will simply have to be left to burn
6674442 b y me ve geli me a nda hamilelikte ileri ya larda kronik hastal olanlarda alkolizmde eksikli i saptanan vitaminler kullan lmal d r
6674443 im just trying to do my bit to help others and warn of the dangers i am not doing what i do to win awards but to help other people
6674444 i dont want young people to drive recklessly on the roads and end up like me
6674445 i used to love snowboarding and just keeping fit but there are so many things i cant do
6674446 the support he has given our charity has been outstanding
6674447 with nick there is no self pity he is the first to tell people that the injuries he received are as a result of him driving like a boy racer
6674448 indeed he gives talks to young people about his ordeal in order to warn them of the dangers of dangerous driving
6674449 nick is also brave one of his fundraising initiatives was a skydive and i hear he is planning a bungee jump
6674450 the letter didnt say it was martyn conway but he later told me it was
6674451 i suggest that your son had lied before and that he often looked to gain your sympathy
6674452 we recognize that there are a lot of problems facing this group
6674453 revenues are up but we needed it to account for the labor wage increase entertainment increase fuel and so forth
6674454 it seemed like we were much busier than last year but when it all came out we were about 900 over last year
6674455 people sometimes stood 30 to 40 deep in line but as long as people got their vikings they were happy one gal stood 35 minutes in line and got up to the window and didnt know what a viking was
6674456 once you reach those peak times you can only get so much food out the window
6674457 this was the biggest year weve ever had there were some days when our gross was down from last year but all in all we were almost 1 000 over
6674458 i was concerned a little bit with the economy and fuel prices but the folks still came out and supported the kids
6674459 more than anything prices were up it didnt matter if it was a grand champion or a runner up a lot of the folks dont even eat the meat they end up doing it as a donation
6674460 we plan on being here for a long time we feel we wont have a problem selling the coal
6674461 these are visionary people who have been in the coal business many years
6674462 i hope it will mean roundup prospers thatd be good said wayne clement a chimney repairman who was riding his bicycle one of clements friends was laid off from the mine but is back working a night shift he said
6674463 yeah i want this to open up it will help our school it will help our town said blaine tull a disabled veteran who served 24 years in the u s marine corps and was born and raised in roundup his wife faye tull owns the pioneer caf
6674464 i think it will bring a lot to this community he said
6674465 people here just dont have a lot of money everybodys talking how it would be a good thing for the community
6674466 we like to see the bikes in town bikers are good for business and good people
6674467 our waitresses really spend time to talk to the bikers to try to get to know what theyre here for and steer them to other local businesses
6674468 its way better mileage most bikes get 50 miles per gallon or more and with a three gallon tank you can fill up for less than 15 bucks
6674469 we also get a lot of bikers who buy and accumulate so much stuff on a trip they want us to ship stuff home for them we do that all the time in cody and billings
6674470 an important part of the tourism traffic we get especially when you talk about sturgis
6674471 obviously wyoming has a lot of great areas for bikers to take advantage of
6674472 its critical they be able to cross in and out of the park
6674473 backcountry sprawl and habitat fragmentation are eating up your winter range
6674474 you can go to every jurisdiction right around the park and youll find that kind of push on the boundaries
6674475 the critters dont have passports and they dont pay attention to park boundaries
6674476 the whitebark pine is essentially gone as a food source for grizzly bears
6674477 the salmon is essentially gone today the berries drive the bears
6674478 im not sure what the bears have left to fall back on
6674479 the interaction between climate and pathogens is sort of a crapshoot
6674480 we still have the potential to preserve some of these linkages
6674481 connectivity is absolutely critical and we have this natural north south pathway called the rocky mountains
6674482 are the species that live in narrow niches such as the canadian lynx and the wolverine
6674483 you start melting those places away and you can see how wolverine range contracts
6674484 they could be gone in just a few years once the snow goes
6674485 so when the scientific consensus is one of alarm that should tell you something
6674486 thats one reason we go to parks i think allowing the wildlife room to roam is a goal that every montanan and every glacier park visitor shares we all want our children and grandchildren to enjoy the wildlife that we enjoy
6674487 and i dont think its likely we can make it colder any time soon
6674488 every little area of connectivity is becoming more and more important all the time
6674489 these outside pressures absolutely affect what the park will look like in 100 years
6674490 were chipping away at the available habitat for now glacier is big enough that species are persisting but climate change is making it smaller
6674491 we should always be thinking about outside threats to the park
6674492 but in a time of abrupt climate change we should also be having a very serious conversation about how those threats might interact with other stressors to change glacier park forever
6674493 i dont think ive ever had such a closely contested race for the quarterback position in my career
6674494 whoever we name as the starter well try to give that player most of next week to get geared into being the guy
6674495 i feel im a good team leader and i can lead this team when we face adversity
6674496 i can be the type of player the offense looks for to get the tide rolling
6674497 i think i can lead the team and i think we can move the ball when im in there
6674498 the team responds well to me i can get the job done if needed
6674499 i like both of them in our offense right now because theyre very similar
6674500 codys strengths are his quick release hes maybe got a little bit stronger arm than mark and runs just a little bit better but mark has a better touch on short passes he has an uncanny ability to protect the football and is mobile himself
6674501 those arent major differences between the guys thats why its been difficult each guys strengths are only slightly better than the other guys
6674502 were going to get him out there hes a good athlete
6674503 but hes going to have to stay on top of everything quarterback wise because the no 3 quarterback can become the no 2 in a hurry
6674504 were very fortunate that our 1984 national championship team came forward to do this project for us
6674505 i think its going to be huge for a number of reasons on game day were going to have a surface thats consistent and playable were going to build our program here by recruiting speed and athleticism and were going to have a surface those guys can thrive on
6674506 i think we have a great republican candidate and i intend to contribute to her campaign in any way i can including financial
6674507 its one of the most important things we can do in this country right now
6674508 this is not a partisan thing it doesnt matter what party you are from if you are raising money from outside sources you are at risk of being accused of being bought and paid for
6674509 all the money in the world may not help you if the voters for some reason or another dont get that message or dont think you stand for what they stand for
6674510 when you get older and fall down youve pretty well had it
6674511 a lot of people are scared to admit a fall
6674512 it gives exact data of how theyre losing their balance
6674513 anything that makes a person feel uncomfortable theyll stop doing because they dont want to lose their balance
6674514 this whole program here this could get a lot of people to where theyre not so likely to fall
6674515 a single record keeping offense because it best reflects what happened
6674516 over the years he had heard from others that the school contained asbestos but he was not told of any tests or studies that had been conducted
6674517 if he had known for certain there is no way that mr ecker would have knowingly exposed his students and himself to asbestos mr ecker worked side by side with the students and he is not an uncaring or irresponsible teacher it should also be noted that mr ecker had no prior experience with asbestos and did not even know what asbestos looked like
6674518 i am very pleased to have exceeded the targets set by the local authority i should like to pay tribute to the team effort between students staff and parents over two years
6674519 we are really pleased with these results they are the best achieved at the college and are a fair reward for the enormous efforts made by students staff and parents over the past two years
6674520 the changes we have put in place with becoming a sports college are beginning to reap rewards
6674521 there is a more focused and disciplined ethos in the school and the students have responded positively to some very good teaching
6674522 we are very pleased by the range and depth of these results they reflect the determination at the college to enable every student to make strong progress
6674523 this illustrates the schools dedication to continuous improvement and its determination to ensure that all students who attend the school achieve highly
6674524 we are overjoyed by the achievement of many of our students every set of results reflects the hard work and dedication of students and the commitment and professionalism of our teachers and other staff in college congratulations particularly to james norman rosalind kenward rosie coleman katy lewis rebecca tron and emily mcgreavy who gained 12 or more gcse passes at grades a and a
6674525 i am excited at our overall results the percentage of students obtaining five a to c grades was 68 per cent which is much higher than the 48 per cent last year and the best result ever achieved by the college by a significant margin
6674526 i am ecstatic about these results the dedication and hard work of the students and staff and the support of parents has culminated in this excellent set of results
6674527 these results maintain the trend of rapid and significant improvement in standards over the last five years students and staff have worked tirelessly to ensure success
6674528 there has been a steady improvement over the years but this is actually quite a jump up with some really superb results
6674529 itu tegantung masing masing daerah itu akan kita percepat dan kita akan jemput bola untuk daerah yang tidak mampu kita datangi langsung ke daerah masing masing minggu depan saya ke sumbar kita lihat kenapa dak disana sampai hari ini belum ada pencairan untuk tahap berikutnya
6674530 kita mencoba untuk proaktif supaya penyerapan daerah itu dapat berkualitas bagus tidak ada kebocoran anggaran memang ada penghematan anggaran tapi harus juga ada penyerapan yang bagus untu mengurangi kemiskinan dsb
6674531 we feel that greensboro contracting or any of its employees didnt do anything wrong
6674532 if anyone had walked 50 feet down the sidewalk it would have been obvious there was a problem
6674533 i think that is a big step toward addressing the issue of fairness
6674534 theres no process in which people who didnt get promoted wont have concerns about why they didnt get promoted
6674535 weve got to get the process started because were holding positions that need to be filled
6674536 i thought they were going to leave and the next thing i know pop and i was bleeding like a dog
6674537 i dont hang out in the streets and i dont believe in gang activity its against my morals
6674538 in addition we will help to make it more widely understood how these nation states are cleverly using the economic weapon to influence the 2008 american presidential and congressional elections
6674539 summer and fall mean more outdoor time and more open windows and more chances for people to come in contact with wildlife including flying bats
6674540 there are more than 100 000 pets that havent been vaccinated in guilford county
6674541 some of it is ignorance people just dont know to do it sometimes they cant afford it or dont know where they can get their pet vaccinated without having to have a bunch of other things done
6674542 given the real time news cycle we live in today many important issues and controversies that impact our country simply do not receive the time and examination they deserve we are in this for the long haul and look forward to engaging on a broad range of issues well beyond the campaign
6674543 the launch of our immediate advocacy effort is a direct response to barack obamas rejection of public financing which will allow the liberal 527s and other leftist organizations to dramatically outspend conservatives this election cycle
6674544 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
6674545 this may be the best researched most thoroughly documented ad in history
6674546 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6674547 i didnt think my life would turn out like this
6674548 all workers including those working in the home or in informal employment are entitled to rest leisure respite and reasonable limitation of working hours as well as appropriate provision for retirement
6674549 im busy doing nothing working the whole day through trying to find lots of things not to do
6674550 do you want me to tell the judge about that skid mark well do you
6674551 hmmm i should really think about cleaning this shouldnt i
6674552 my lord housework is duller than a council tax booklet and about as sexy as nicholas soames in a donkey thong however i do occasionally spray everything in sight with ecover then wash it off why should anyone do more than that until things begin to walk of their own accord as for ironing and washing up my partner can just do his own clothes and dishes if the plague comes back haul me up then but not now
6674553 the defendant is right i hate housework too and never do it myself i think we should ban it altogether
6674554 it is very difficult to establish the authenticity of most reports that circulate in the name of the prophet muhammad but clearly many reports were projected retrospectively back upon the prophet without being reliably attributed to him muslims are confronted with hadith in which the prophet reportedly speaks about issues that did not exist in his lifetime such as the shia sunni schism various theological heresies and even the systematic collection of hadith
6674555 forged hadith reports condemning same sex sexual relations began to circulate in earnest during the abbasid period 750 1258 ad when it became aristocratic and courtly fashion to own young male slaves employ handsome wine bearers and flaunt same sex romances many hadiths were circulated in the name of the prophet to address these practices as part of the traditionalist cultural war on the cosmopolitan elite of abbasid era cities
6674556 reassessment of the authenticity of hadith reports is the key to legal and social reform among muslims
6674557 i cant help you love you are all wet and might damage my boat
6674558 oh love i am so sad that i need to be by myself
6674559 because only time is capable of understanding how valuable love is
6674560 he has an easy effortless swing the ball jumps off his bat but sometimes he gets caught up in pulling the ball instead of using the whole field when you see a guy hitting 220 or 230 chances are his mind is into pulling the ball ive seen him hitting balls out of the park to the left side he should be more consistent doing that but that will come with time
6674561 its one of the most incredible pieces of technology ive ever seen
6674562 its like giving a police officer three or four extra sets of eyes
6674563 first of all it would increase our efficiency in locating stolen vehicles and license tags
6674564 i went over my whole life i went over my whole childhood i didnt talk to anyone for a week
6674565 there is no act which one nation sooner learns from another than how to drain money from the pockets of the people
6674566 its the most beautiful campus weve visited its the most beautiful campus we may ever visit
6674567 we are an islamic institution of course and im glad weve learned about some different religious groups
6674568 theres a commonality of people of faith that transcends this institution
6674569 at the end of the day our goal is to create good citizens
6674570 we want them to go home and be good citizens in all the worlds in which they live
6674571 im thinking maybe i shouldnt have filed my nails last night
6674572 ill be back in 2012 for the olympics in london
6674573 the tragedy of life does not lie in not reaching your goals the tragedy of life is not having goals to reach for

6674579 it is crucial to ices homeland security mission to know who enters sensitive areas like airports military bases and power plants to ensure the integrity of these key assets
6674580 this operation illustrates ices ongoing efforts in partnership with federal and local agencies to secure the critical infrastructure within the national capital region
6674581 should be interesting to see the place lit and dare i say clean
6674582 there comes a point in your life when you realize who matters who never did and who always will so dont worry about the people from your past because there is a reason they didnt make it to your future
6674583 i didnt know whether to bring diapers to practice sometimes
6674584 the professional championship is coming up and my ultimate goal has always been to win the section championship
6674585 ill work hard in the coming weeks and hopefully get it done
6674586 i will be for change and ill bring you change
6674587 first week back it takes a bit of time to get back into the swing of things and i did make a few mistakes out there
6674588 i wouldnt want to make them the next three days and hopefully i dont make them the next three days
6674589 im going to go and do some practice and you know you get days like that and i just hope that i dont get another one tomorrow or the next day or the next day
6674590 i thought i played nicely but middle of the round i missed a number of really good birdie chances and then took four twice and two sixes
6674591 looking back at it you have to say i didnt feel like i did much wrong but some of thats that mental tiredness i know its difficult out there and the rough is tough but that was just bad play on my behalf
6674592 the candidate republicans should be clamoring for is the one liberals are most feverishly denouncing that is mitt romney by a landslide
6674593 he just tripped off a chair he was getting ready to speak somebody aimed a gun at him and him he dove for the floor
6674594 prominent evangelical leaders are warning sen john mccain against picking former massachusetts gov mitt romney as his running mate saying their troops will abandon the republican ticket on election day if that happens
6674595 they say mr romney lacks trust on issues such as outlawing abortion and opposing same sex marriage and because he is a mormon opposition is particularly powerful among those who supported former arkansas gov mike huckabee in the republican presidential primaries earlier this year
6674596 other well placed christian conservatives say that although many evangelical leaders could accept and work for a mccain romney ticket mr huckabees supporters tend to be rabid in their views against mr romney because of his faith they do not regard mormonism as a christian denomination
6674597 i am wholeheartedly convinced that mitt romney can be trusted to uphold the values and principles most important to me as a political conservative and an evangelical christian again i am not being paid and i am not interested in a job in a romney administration i would not accept one even if offered as im still raising three teenagers neither is my public relations firm involved in any way i am involved because i believe the stakes are high perhaps higher than ever before in my life
6674598 a moving story indeed odd that mccain forgot all about it until he needed a moving tale to get the vote of christians
6674599 see that small planet i want you to go to that planet and bring peace to the inhabitants
6674600 but god that planet is full of large angry vicious dogs they will tear me apart they will kill me
6674601 yes jon i know and by the way you will go to the planet as a chihuahua
6674602 oh and one other thing jon after this planet you will remain a chihuahua forever
6674603 theyre in drought they havent had crops for a number of years and this is the first opportunity to make actually a dollar for a long time
6674604 so these people are hurting just like the farmers in south australia
6674605 people in new south wales and queensland have a water entitlement an amount of water theyre allowed to extract from the river and they choose to put that to cotton
6674606 cotton is an average water user as far as the amount of water it uses per hectare when you compare it to other crops
6674607 contrariamente ao que se previa h pouco mais de seis meses j pouca gente acredita que o eng jos s crates consiga renovar a maioria absoluta
6674608 ah that was some nice sex you do what you want woman amon go play my pokemans

6674613 conjures all the requisite jap stereotypes grotesque buckteeth thick rimmed glasses unforgivable asian accent
6674614 arguably the most racist anti asian film in american cinematic history
6674615 offensive derogatory and hateful racial stereotypes detrimental and destructive to our society
6674616 for screen on the green we typically get a few hundred people
6674617 were looking for movies that people of all ages races and ethnicities can enjoy
6674618 unfortunately we were unable to do that since the film was already mailed out from the distribution company we contracted with in illinois
6674619 but its an educational opportunity and thats how we plan to handle it
6674620 i dont have any problem going back and looking at historic movies
6674621 because mickey rooney plays this character throughout the entire movie
6674622 a lot of young people are not aware of these stereotypes and dont even think theyre offensive but its particularly offensive to those of us who grew up in the 50s and 60s they were used to insult and taunt us while we were at school
6674623 its got nice music the moon river theme song and audrey hepburns a great actress very classy playing a young woman in new york city trying to strike out on her own
6674624 if it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the lord
6674625 i was surprised at the reaction at the meeting people were jumping out of their seats
6674626 she was on the field when they won the gold medal
6674627 i think so many of us for so long looked up to the players who are no longer here
6674628 hopefully now america will start to look up to the players around me
6674629 its just a feeling that we have and nobody can break that bond
6674630 i think the chemistry of that u s olympic team was fantastic
6674631 it had a lot to do with the new coach she made the game fun again for that team
6674632 a lot of them just needed the opportunity to be put on that stage
6674633 in europe that soccer is a mens sport theres not as many opportunities as in the states
6674634 it was really not until the 80s we took it really seriously
6674635 the rest of the world has been going for 100 years on the other side of the coin in most countries they dont encourage young ladies to participate in sports fortunately its getting better
6674636 were historically ahead in womens soccer were historically behind in mens soccer
6674637 it gives younger players in club soccer something to strive for
6674638 i hope it keeps a whole bunch of youths motivated its great
6674639 it really makes you see how much you value your teammates and people around you
6674640 she hasnt sacrificed her ideals ethics or morals or anything like that
6674641 unfortunately there are examples of serious fires starting and in apartment complexes you have a lot of families living close together
6674642 are they going to have barbecue police going around and looking at barbecues on balconies no
6674643 but for some apartment owners with wood decked balconies its not a bad thing to do in the spirit of safety and for your residents
6674644 we do go to fires caused by barbecues on balconies
6674645 we may go to a few of these every year
6674646 fred was taking over samples and drawings to show what his concept was i drove him over there
6674647 it was at a period when fred was transitioning from studio and gallery art to doing a lot more public commissions
6674648 i saw him working on the pieces i was his assistant for the one in rancho murieta
6674649 as soon as we heard that smud was undercharging us we immediately put provisions aside from the utilities budget fund to cover the anticipated charge
6674650 in addition we have been working with smud to negotiate the repayment
6674651 it is good news for the city that the bill only goes back three years and obviously we never like to see errors like this but this is highly unusual
6674652 it doesnt serve either one of us any good to point fingers
6674653 we identified the problem now lets fix it and move forward
6674654 youre a good smart person you can have this job
6674655 were going to stop the public works projects in your neighborhood and building roads and all of those things
6674656 look ill step out there and take the risk of getting attacked but its ok
6674657 stop and lets lock the building and just spend time on the budget
6674658 the overwhelming feedback we received is that taking laptops out of their cases is for many travelers one of the most frustrating parts of checkpoint screening
6674659 so we approached the travel industry to see what they could do to help
6674660 and even with a checkpoint friendly bag if our security officer is unable to see the laptop clearly on the machine or needs to see it they will still ask the passenger to remove it from the bag
6674661 none of my suppliers have provided any information on them yet except travelon which is hoping to have them by october
6674662 in manufacturing the usual lead time is three months from design to a finished product
6674663 i think ill have my staff get back to you
6674664 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6674665 but if youre like me and youve got one house or if you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6674666 by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
6674667 he couldnt count high enough apparently to know how many houses he owns
6674668 its not like were carrying nuclear weapons and these surfboards arent much heavier than a carry on
6674669 its ridiculous when youre having to pay more for your board than the price of your airline ticket
6674670 you have to skip nice meals and give up that nice bottle of tequila
6674671 there are handling costs associated with surfboards that we have to account for
6674672 they just think that its an extra pain on their employees that the boards take up extra space on their planes and that we make up a small percentage of its passengers
6674673 you know i just realized im going to be paying 360 to take my board along
6674674 eligibility has already been investigated by authorities in the international federation
6674675 if the athletes hadnt been cleared they wouldnt have participated
6674676 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig the international gymnastics federation and ioc
6674677 an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6674678 i hope my county will win gold medals but the rest of the world must be convinced
6674679 that steamboat willie is in the public domain is easy thats a foregone conclusion
6674680 law and equity might line up on the side of forfeiture
6674681 disney has enough ammunition on its side to dissuade all but the most well financed competitor or any but the most committed public interest advocates from challenging mickey
6674682 is that he was not afraid of controversy or conflict he was a combative player and he was the same way when he fought for the players
6674683 but he also was a visionary that too is his legacy he was smart enough to recognize that if you make progress at someone elses expense that can come back and haunt you if you get a deal that is so sweet it leaves others wanting what have you really accomplished you have to leave something on the table
6674684 i would never leave until this new deal is done
6674685 mr upshaws secretary spoke to him then called back within a half hour
6674686 she said of course he remembers alva who was his teammate for a year they paid for the funeral but didnt want any publicity
6674687 i know he upshaw is receiving a lot of criticism from older players but i wanted to share something showing how he helped people he cared
6674688 can teach us a lot about the meaning of courage
6674689 and in these challenging economic times we need to call on the wisdom of people like meg whitman
6674690 i havent decided at all what i will do after the election
6674691 i dont think i will speculate on that today he has a lot of very good people to choose from and i know he will make a great choice
6674692 we looked at each other and said thats quite an honor he was genuinely thrilled
6674693 understanding that high tech can literally change the future of companies and countries
6674694 the rumor all over silicon valley is that meg wants to run for governor
6674695 she was very articulate with a very strong presence i think its safe to bet that she has political ambitions
6674696 she has done it in such a humble non showy way
6674697 she doesnt seek the limelight she just does the work
6674698 one of the leading voices in the senate against taxing the internet
6674699 she seems genuinely connected to opportunities in the future and how they will help people on the ground
6674700 she balances a sense of urgency as a business leader with the ability to have patience as a government leader
6674701 if she were to be a part of government do i think she would be very good in that field yes i do
6674702 the 30s are where you start hitting your stride really start hitting your prime
6674703 right now physically im as healthy as ive been in years so the physical part of the game is back to where it used to be the mental part of the game is there so it feels great
6674704 texting while driving is so obviously unsafe that its hard to believe anyone would attempt it yet everyday observation suggests there are an awful lot of folks who do
6674705 there is already sufficient law that can be applied if someone is driving while distracted
6674706 we dont need a law for everything a driver does the next one is going to be you cant drive while you are eating a hamburger
6674707 using an electronic wireless communications device to write send or read a text based communication
6674708 i will give every ounce of my energy every ounce of my intellect to work with you to work with the people of california to accomplish great things

6674713 weve been through this before but weve never been this close
6674714 they tried to find some compromise formula to some points its too early to say they reached an agreement on all issues
6674715 he is reluctant to pass it because he cares about his own popularity with the population he tells his people and party that it should be one way maybe he tells rice another thing
6674716 we denounce the visit of mistress of evil condoleezza rice to iraq
6674717 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
6674718 its amazing to me when i go to the pole how thin the ice is huge open spots of water in some areas
6674719 before you spent more time getting there and more time in the ice wed have helicopters looking for breaks in the water for us
6674720 i just hope nobody else has to go through something like this in their life
6674721 people have to be very careful about who they befriend and let into their homes because you never know
6674722 trying to keep his will is the main thing were trying to do right now
6674723 he had no permission to be there in sacramento and if he was it was not to the knowledge of his agent of record
6674724 the appearance that ive ignored these folks i dont think is quite true
6674725 we have come to the conclusion that loomis seems to want to sue everyone without first trying to solve the problems
6674726 el piloto les dijo que fallaba el motor izquierdo y que no
6674727 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
6674728 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
6674729 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
6674730 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
6674731 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
6674732 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
6674733 it could be like something out of a greek myth
6674734 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
6674735 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
6674736 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
6674737 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
6674738 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
6674739 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
6674740 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
6674741 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
6674742 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
6674743 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
6674744 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
6674745 communikey was born out of a history of electronic music culture in colorado
6674746 it started with renegade mountain parties where we would haul our soundsystem into the woods and dance around a bonfire under the full moon the community bond is very strong we know were taking our local scene to the next level but everyone here is quite seasoned for it and we know the community was ready for this

6674762 living systems cannot be steered or controlled they can only be teased nudged titillated
6674763 a specific type of leadership is emerging that is developing the authority and resources to convene and maintain the dialogues for developing shared visions and perspectives
6674764 i can add to that list of capabilities knowledge of many different models including those i have referred to above a wide network of deep and generative relationships with other such practitioners and diplomats and an understanding of what kinds of interventions are most appropriate for what circumstances

6674780 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments is not uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it we were surprised to learn that we had found a new virus
6674781 in theory we could use this virus to produce a lethal toxin in the mosquito or instruct the mosquito to die after 10 days which is before it can transmit the malaria parasite to humans however these concepts are many years away

6674787 tau is natively unfolded or floppy so in solution it moves around a lot and can adopt many different structures
6674788 you can measure the lengths of individual molecules and the average will be a pretty good description of any one
6674789 are all over the place theyre so diverse that its difficult to get one measurement that describes all of the possible structures
6674790 we generated lots and lots of structures for both normal tau and a mutant form
6674791 a list of all types of suspect conformations for known tau mutants then from that list we can design drugs for each

6674795 this is newsday giving this woman a license to assault these fine men in print accusing them of complicity in murder newsday should immediately publish a full retraction and an abject and absolute apology to those defamed by this womans wretched words

6674797 because of its liberal teachings and his belief that all liberals should be killed because they were ruining the country and that the democrats had tied his countrys hands in the war on terror and had ruined every institution in america with the aid of media outlets

6674803 the far left in america is dominated by haters people who despise their own country
6674804 i am very proud of everything i wrote in let freedom ring
6674805 sure these guys hold some responsibility for what happened but we all hold responsibility particularly anyone who hasnt stood up and spoken out against hate speech were all contributing to the climate where people are being dehumanized because of their beliefs

6674817 why did the vietnamese shoot down john mccain and put him in prison for five years he seems like such a nice guy
6674818 mccains sacrifice had nothing to do with protecting the united states he was sent to vietnam along with hundreds of thousands of others in an attempt to prop up what was essentially an american colony south vietnam which was being run by a dictator whom we installed
6674819 that had we taken the war to the north and made full consistent use of air power in the north we ultimately would have prevailed
6674820 is it morally right to drop bombs and missiles in a heavily populated area where hundreds if not thousands of civilians will perish
6674821 because johns father was the naval commander in the pacific theater he was exploited with tv interviews while wounded
6674822 i can verify that john has an infamous reputation for being a hot head he has a quick and explosive temper that many have experienced first hand folks quite honestly that is not the finger i want next to that

6674838 i guess you just trust that people are connected enough to themselves to each other and to nature that they wouldnt totally decimate the earth that they wouldnt care only about some ore
6674839 to me all the opposition is showing what people really value i find it so heartening thats still there in the human spirit
6674840 what this does is give producers and processors one more tool in the toolbox to make these commodities safer and protect public health
6674841 who right now may be afraid to eat uncooked produce
6674842 its one big step forward in improving the safety of fresh produce
6674843 we are currently doing extensive testing with irradiation and it looks to be very promising
6674844 its expensive and it doesnt really address the problem at the source
6674845 but the traditional methods are going to do a slightly better job for those two things

6674848 ive been working as a designer in sacramento since 1964
6674849 there is a certain edginess here now clients are more aware of design and they want to take a chance
6674850 were selling that restaurants are continually trying to keep up
6674851 there is a new culture of people who appreciate how design and architecture can affect life
6674852 but design is equally important people are attracted to a look

6674864 then she knew it was time to tell her story
6674865 little by little over the years my mother would share tiny little stories
6674866 i always wondered why my mother didnt like firecrackers its because the popping noise sounded like the gunfire at camp that scared the bejesus out of her
6674867 i wanted so much to know more about her experiences but i had to wait until 2007 thats when i learned about that little owl
6674868 suddenly i saw a whole country of people being put in a desert dungeon
6674869 the documentary gives a different perspective on the relocation camps told from a caucasian teenagers point of view
6674870 thats how my mother remembered it as a teen not as a woman so its told with all that drama all that grief it emotionally drains me too

6674880 all the three ships are still moving and appear to be heading toward somali territorial water a warship has been dispatched to monitor and track the vessels
6674881 somalia has no central government we are worried that more may join the pirates to hijack ships because its very lucrative and there is no deterrent
6674882 the united nations is the only agency that can stop this menace the international community has to agree to find ways to solve this worsening problem that is the only way forward
6674883 all i remember is that i saw the flash and i pulled him to get him out of the way of the blast thats all i remember
6674884 i went to disneyland and the cannons starting firing off the ship
6674885 and here i am low crawling across the ground knowing full well that im in disneyland but my bodys reacting
6674886 to get back into the work force and be able to see that i can succeed and that what i wrote down on my resume is true and that i can do it and i have a lot to offer has really decreased stress
6674887 to overcome those obstacles and being able to be out in the work force has really helped emphasize that i can do it and i can succeed
6674888 but for the western media none of this was relevant for them everything seems to have begun with the russian intervention portrayed as a crime of aggression and even ethnic cleansing somehow the georgian attack on the small ossetian minority is not ethnic cleansing
6674889 george bush condemns the russian attack as a violation of georgian sovereignty did sovereignty concerns ever bother the united states during its attacks on various nations
6674890 the media accept it when the us says it needs to stay on in iraq to guarantee security when the russians say they need to linger longer in georgia for the same reasons we get more western talk about sovereignty violation and czechoslovakia
6674891 if the priority is blind support for the bankrupt saakashvili regime and if they are ready to pay the price of a break in relations with russia then that is not our choice we are not planning to slam the door on nato
6674892 recovery will take time uk businesses are being slowed by more difficult economic conditions
6674893 we have made a solid start with strong improvement in customer service over the past four months but we are on a three to five year journey to profit recovery our underlying strength is that we have generally attractive market positions and our great opportunity is that we have room for improvement almost everywhere

6674915 wait until youve got a weeks of diapers in there
6674916 one more player is possible and barry is one of the players we are following i find him a good player but the problem is with players who are 27 28 you pay big money but you get nothing back there is no resale
6674917 we are not in a desperate situation alexandre song has come back from china abou diaby doesnt look too far away hopefully we can get good news from tomas rosicky in the next two weeks
6674918 i wanted to take him a few years ago when they extended his contract with manchester united
6674919 hes 31 for a striker thats quite a reasonable age but for a central defender hes still good for me central defenders can play until 34 at the top level without any problems
6674920 he was in advanced talks with manchester city already but i heard that he was completely free he can play centre back and left back thats an area where we were a little bit short especially on the left flank he has a great team attitude and were a bit light experience wise in the dressing room
6674921 the president said to robinho that if a 40 million euros 31 7 million offer appears he would let him leave
6674922 so i have to say that until aug 31 everything is possible until the transfer window is closed i cant say where robinho will play this season robinho never said that he wasnt comfortable at real madrid but the thing is that he has a financial offer that is very interesting its only that
6674923 nothing is official at the moment he is still a chelsea player
6674924 drogba will not be back before a month and a half
6674925 he has started to run but he will not be available against mozambique on sept 5
6674926 that eyebrows have been raised outside this country at the highest levels in the cycling world by the union cycliste internationale uci for instance about the way in which the bcf has managed the sport in this country
6674927 great britain as a completely black spot in the international cycling market
6674928 people dont realise how close this place came to being bankrupt and closed down within a few weeks of myself and the new board taking over it became apparent that this place which was being run as manchester velodrome limited a wholly owned subsidiary of the bcf was not washing its face there was a big outstanding bill for gas and electricity about 130 000 which manchester city council agreed to cover for us if that hadnt been covered then wed have been bankrupt the padlocks would have been on id say we were within ten days of that happening this place would probably have been turned into a b amp q warehouse
6674929 when british cycling received an initial award of around 2
6674930 then im going to the bcf national council meeting that autumn
6674931 and im standing up there with a powerpoint presentation its probably the first time theyd seen a powerpoint presentation at national council and saying this is a vision for the future which looks an awful lot different to what it looks like now and this is how were gonna do it
6674932 was to create a professional team membership of which would be the aspiration of every ambitious athlete and coach in the country i wasnt specific in terms of reaching world number one or two there was a business plan behind it in terms of progression and events we were going to target and medals i thought we could win but the aspirational vision was to create a professional national team system that anybody anybody with ambition and talent would want to find their way into because they were convinced that if they were in there that it was the best place they could be like sandhurst or the royal academy people who are any good they want to be in there they think thats where i have to be its a magnet for ambition
6674933 two or three occasions when we thought peter was going to walk because of all the pressure and stress and criticism
6674934 mens professional road cycling was and may still be almost completely dominated by an underlying drug culture and almost regardless of whether i think thats right or wrong in the context of the programme i was charged with creating having a drug system or even a tolerance of a drug system was just not an option
6674935 the national squad were invited to sit in and this guy stepped up and gave this presentation and the first thing that struck you was that it looked really professional there was no flip chart and markers and you could see people thinking my goodness this is really good there were a lot of cynical people around but even the anti peter keen people against their will were probably a little bit impressed by the ambition if nothing else
6674936 but there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world as there are pretty women to deserve them

6674950 a large income is the best recipe for happiness i ever heard of

6674989 by the time theyre taking the psat its much too late to determine whether they should be taking algebra in the eighth grade biology and other important gatekeeper classes needed for college
6674990 this test will help schools identify students who have some talent and could likely succeed if they take honors or ap courses but have not been recognized
6674991 just because you go to a public school you should still have the same opportunities
6674992 if you want your kid to go to a highly selective institution you really do have to know in the eighth grade
6674993 theyre locked in a death match with act over who takes the act or the sat once you buy into a certain product line youre likely to stick with it
6674994 by the time they apply to school the results would not be relevant
6674995 that plays out in kids real lives most of them are taking a hodgepodge of classes and by the end of 11th grade its too late
6674996 eighth grade is not the key year for college assessment thats sixth grade
6674997 now were going to have a preadmission test to get ready for the preadmission test get ready to get ready to get ready
6674998 to believe you need an eighth grade test on top of the psat and sat is just insane
6674999 we have people in sacramento and in political offices that think that accountability is testing and accountability is not testing
6675000 the eighth grade california standards test should tell us how children are prepared for high school im not sure we need it again in the ninth grade in the 10th grade and then the 11th grade teachers are so loaded down with tests they have very little time to teach anymore
6675001 our primary purpose is to check on how effectively are schools preparing students and we see them as very important
6675002 california has a very shabby test setup a lot of these testing outfits are entrepreneurial theyre trying to make a buck
6675003 if there is a market to be served to add another test theyre more than willing to do that

6675049 the laptops donated to us are durable and friendly to our environment in that they can be used by pupils in all geographical and physical conditions
6675050 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull

6675056 it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now but people have got to understand that this will happen
6675057 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6675058 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6675059 its great i come from a country where we only have 120 bmx riders
6675060 i hope this achievement will make people sit up and take notice of us and help us to get better
6675061 i was just trying to lean into the corner to hold on to third and guys are just riding stupid trying moves that werent on
6675062 im pretty disappointed about how some of the other guys rode i know theyve got to be aggressive its the olympic final but they took themselves down in the process

6675069 we are still clearing the highway and i am confident it will be open soon
6675070 sandilands is having a real dominance in the ruck and from that their clearances have improved as well
6675071 certainly troy simmonds and tristan cartledge our ruckmen have really got to be strong this week against sandilands not to give him the dominance in the ruck to allow their midfield area to clean up around the stoppages
6675072 nathans our best clearance player so its extremely important that hes playing this weekend
6675073 hes trained all week and as far as were concerned hes definitely in

6675080 hes also got a fungal infection on his skin but its got into his blood supply and poisoned his blood

6675082 he used to have a plump round face and its a gaunt looking face now
6675083 he asked me are the lions in the top eight so i got that bit
6675084 this is a major breakthrough for older patients who have a worn out failing aortic valve and too many other medical problems to make conventional surgery a good option

6675086 im actually hoping to join a gym after all this is over
6675087 thats what i prefer to do especially for myself but also the team when theres two halves calling the shots i can just float around and do what i do
6675088 i think thats when we play our best when weve got the two halves named there
6675089 last week and weeks in the past ive played a bit of fullback and then had to play in the halves when weve only had one other half or five eighth there
6675090 with bedds me and the two halves on the field at the same time i think its going to be good for us
6675091 if we make the semis were going to be seventh or eighth and were going to be playing one of those sides anyway

6675188 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6675189 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6675190 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6675219 among storage virtualization products our research data shows about 12 000 ibm svc and about 9 300 hds usp and nsc55 deployments to date compared with about 2 000 for v series
6675220 this integration is probably meant to push v series and is also part of netapps campaign to go from a nas to an infrastructure supplier

6675295 algunas especies como el pez trompeta ya se han localizado entre t nez y sicilia
6675296 si las especies llegan a un punto determinado y consiguen reproducirse se puede decir que han logrado penetrar en el ecosistema con xito
6675297 hay moluscos peces como el pez le n y equinodermos como las estrellas de mar que est n desplazando o cohabitando con especies aut ctonas
6675298 las temperaturas medias est n aumentando y las especies que antes no se sent an c modas est n encontrando nuevos espacios que colonizar

6675304 this generation of college students and their parents are closer relationship wise than any other generation
6675305 it is the complete opposite of the late 60s they want independence but they also value the role of their parents and family in a drastically different way
6675306 frankly we know this is just the beginning of this generation
6675307 they arent going away so were trying to embrace working with the parents theyve been super involved in their kids lives since birth they arent just going to stop because we say so
6675308 it was the complete opposite of pomona college where my other son went
6675309 there they told us to stay away here it was more about telling us what is available to students and ways parents can get involved they still told us students needed to be independent but they were a lot more accommodating of parents
6675310 ten years ago if students were having a problem the calls went to a staff member in the dean of students office
6675311 now without question the calls go home first so we have to partner with parents to help students become self reliant adults we view parents as agents of student retention
6675312 they told us that if we didnt sign up we basically dont have any access to his life at all
6675313 honestly i have open doors with my parents but its good because theres a chance they could catch something about bills being due that i might miss with guest link
6675314 its always nice to have someone who has your back
6675315 this group of parents are doers used to making a difference
6675316 it was a great event and we couldnt have done it without the parents
6675317 it is about encouraging independence and responsibility in the student but keeping parents informed too
6675318 kids need to make their own mistakes but that said if parents are informed about what the university has in place to keep our kids safe and healthy then when they do call us we can give them advice instead of freaking out and driving to the campus if you feel the university is keeping you away from your child you get more worried
6675319 of course you know your student best but at the university we have found

6675345 hes also a good pass catcher and a really good pass protector especially for his size he gets so low to the ground he comes up underneath people and leverages them
6675346 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play

6675356 i want to know from the principal person kennedy the details they are not on the internet or available publicly shine a light on this and tell us all

6675369 theyll have to face him again at their place and dannys pretty good about making adjustments and can throw breaking stuff for strikes early in the count so well see how adjustments go on both sides
6675370 coming back quickly from microfracture surgery like he did i dont want him out there typically more than four in a row
6675371 i like to mix tony in there too because he needs some consistent at bats to be able to come of the bench and do what he does
6675372 certain days its real good other days hell never admit it hell feel it a little bit
6675373 we have already taken into consideration the utilization of venues after the games
6675374 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here its definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather
6675375 the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6675376 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6675377 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6675378 the greens are good i mean theyre perfect perfect speed
6675379 i think you can be aggressive i was committed to my lines and made aggressive strokes
6675380 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6675381 low cost carriers are growing at 9 percent a year and from an environmental point of view that is a problem
6675382 vindicated i feel great i feel amazing i just won a gold medal
6675383 it was hard and this win wasnt just down to my goal
6675384 it was only achievable with the team we have and that we played for each other
6675385 but i feel stronger in the end i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went through it i learned a lot about myself
6675386 when i entered the water i had a feeling that i was going to win
6675387 i think the leukemia taught me to think step by step
6675388 when youre laying in the hospital bed and feeling so much pain and feeling so tired you dont want to think about next week or next month youre only thinking about the next hour
6675389 you just be patient you lay in your bed and just wait its almost the same strategy ive used here to stay in the pack to be patient and stay easy just waiting for your chance
6675390 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man
6675391 he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known
6675392 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6675393 he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6675394 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6675395 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6675396 theres no up side to being adversarial in these kind of deals
6675397 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6675398 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6675399 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6675400 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6675401 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6675402 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6675403 with some questions still remaining we asked the federation to take a closer look
6675404 i impact discover and verify tending of myself but i also same a algid beer erst in a while
6675405 its like michael said the other day debbie phelps mother wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6675406 i was not expecting anything like this i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and coaches
6675407 2012 isnt out of the question right now but im taking it one day at a time
6675408 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6675409 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose
6675410 i was real excited to be a part of an organization that hes in because hes turned programs around hes won championships hes been around the best
6675411 and im just very excited to learn from him and play for him
6675412 we have taken up the cause of providing electricity in 100 villages across the world by feb 2009 and through this tour hopefully we will be able to contribute towards providing solar lantern to at least one village in india
6675413 33 per cent of the universe is without electricity and a large part of this is in india
6675414 we have taken up the cause of providing electricity in 100 villages across the world by feb 2009 and through this tour hopefully we will be able to contribute towards providing solar lantern to at least one village in india as the tour moves we would like to increase the number of villages that we can lend our support to
6675415 in an attempt to fight the global challenge of climate change the unforgettable stars and the the producers of the show wizcraft international entertainment pvt ltd have pledged their unflinching support to this worthy cause
6675416 usa and other developed countries might have caused global emission but all of us are victims and hence its time we take preventive measures when it is a global challenge at hand the indian film fraternity sure does sit up and take notice
6675417 the show strives to use its global platform and the phenomenal reach of the unforgettable stars to campaign for this noble cause through the campaign the stars welcome contributions from millions of indian cinema fans from across the world whereby people can contribute to the cause by purchasing single solar lanterns or adopting a village
6675418 we had a wonderful trip so far and we are on the last leg of the tour here where we hope to give a little bit extra running the extra mile
6675419 the indian cinema has grown phenomenally earning huge revenues worldwide it was most memorable for me last time at wembley stadium here where 70 000 people had turned up
6675420 create resentment and anger among those firms we have to retain
6675421 the ux meme of the consumer facing world leaking into the enterprise
6675422 the days of the battleship gray forms of data application as the king of the enterprise are numbered because of an imperative towards richer visualization of complex and interconnected data
6675423 while there will always be a need for the traditional sort of application by the end of 2008 it is no longer the only element of the corporate landscape
6675424 wir haben gesehen was die mannschaft f r einen aufwand betreiben musste um gegen diese gegner die optimale punktzahl holen zu k nnen
6675425 ich h tte gern mal gesehen wenn wir da nicht solche verletzungsprobleme gehabt h tten
6675426 wir arbeiten daran uns weiterhin gegen die namhaften und renommierten klubs zu behaupten wir sammeln so viele punkte wie m glich und dann schauen wir mal was f r eine platzierung f r uns rausspringt
6675427 die liga wird sehr ausgeglichen sein wir glauben auch nicht an ein nord s d gef lle wir denken dass bei vielen spielen die tagesform ausschlaggebend ist
6675428 es ist wahnsinn was da f r emotionsgeladene stimmung herrscht
6675429 so etwas w rde ich mir mal von den leuten in d sseldorf w nschen die leute da leben fu ball
6675430 f r mich ist das die heimst rkste mannschaft der liga wenn du dich als gegner nicht von beginn an wehrst gehst du da unter
6675431 wir haben spiele gewonnen die allesamt sehr hart umk mpft waren
6675432 wir funktionieren als team sehr gut wir werfen tugenden in die waagschale die man nicht kaufen kann
6675433 why didnt xyz happen in history or whats its cause
6675434 is problem such that certain percentage of lispers ask these questions or get confused by these
6675435 the concepts and confusions of prefix infix postfix and fully
6675436 when the elephants fight the sign in before you can post messages
6675437 ja gut der joker wird halt ein psychopath sein der chaos stiften will
6675438 once the games are complete we will be conducting a comprehensive review of all our programs
6675439 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays
6675440 the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6675441 er war es nicht da bin ich mir hundert prozent sicher dann kann ich es mir doch nicht so leicht machen und einfach die versicherung zahlen lassen
6675442 es gab damals einen zweiten pfau den wohl fremde auf meinem hof ausgesetzt hatten wir kriegten ihn nie zu fassen
6675443 das war ein j ngerer pfauenhahn der hatte noch nicht so einen langen schwanz
6675444 i take it personally as a rematch because they beat us in 2006 and hopefully we can beat them
6675445 i was thinking im going to get a base hit all the way
6675446 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
6675447 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
6675448 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
6675449 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
6675450 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
6675451 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
6675452 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
6675453 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves

6675463 s o paulo cresce o brasil tem de crescer junto
6675464 o que me foi dito que houve um interesse muito grande pela palestra agora quando voc vai como candidato em per odo eleitoral voc tem gente de um partido e gente de outro uns que se manifestam e outros que n o
6675465 possivelmente s o as pessoas que ap iam o maluf e o pitta que se sentiram ofendidas com jovens n o tranquilo
6675466 o que n s tivemos foi uma manifesta o de pessoas provavelmente contr rias hostis nos primeiros momentos depois comecei a falar fomos conquistando e dando o recado e depois aplaudiram n o uma situa o f cil para o palestrante voc ver xingamentos e gritaria nos primeiros minutos mas voc resiste tem coragem e voc consegue superar
6675467 n o vim preparada estava mais organizado do que eu poderia ter imaginado
6675468 mas essa uma forma de manifesta o que n o comum quando se vem espontaneamente
6675469 s o paulo n o pode ficar quatro anos sem reformas estruturais
6675470 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988
6675471 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6675472 real hardwood flooring we have narrow 2 1 4 width to 4 1 4
6675473 this is from the gentleman who is seated over there
6675474 for the past few days our phone has just been ringing off the hook
6675475 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6675476 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6675477 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6675478 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6675479 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6675480 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6675481 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6675482 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6675483 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6675484 if you trust every web site but not a government there are so many web sites so much hearsay
6675485 these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6675486 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6675487 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6675488 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6675489 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6675490 fair play is an important aspect of the olympic movement and the ioc is responsible for ensuring that everybody is playing by the rules this issue needs to be resolved and it needs to be behind us once the ioc feels it has done everything in its power to resolve it everyone is going to have to accept that at some level
6675491 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been alluded to by certain parties
6675492 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence to 100 percent clarify the situation and put this to rest

6675499 it has great songs its not an ignorant album it doesnt sound dated
6675500 if you listen to it and compare it to whats out now its timeless
6675501 people say wu tang makes you think too much whats wrong with thinking
6675502 a lot of dudes write these street tales and theyre so gory cause they think gory is visual theyre so literal and so street level you know like crack spots and whatever
6675503 i wanted to write something and take it to a level where nobodys done it
6675504 it was done in rzas house in his basement in staten island i remember being there and some of the beats were running for like two days nonstop cold world was one of them
6675505 but the chemistry production overall i mean cmon rzas atmospheric production yes its my best album
6675506 they do folkier stuff like my music i thought blue note had a lot of integrity and so far its been really good
6675507 i didnt want to shorten hartranft and i didnt just want to go by just priscilla thats too much
6675508 for six months i performed as i am a girl but it was too vague and awkward to announce i thought maybe i can use my moms maiden name its a lot prettier and simpler
6675509 spike lee la mia stazzema il regista parla del suo film
6675510 other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6675511 we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6675512 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment
6675513 all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6675514 we know that the industry is facing these acute challenges and i cant say with any certainty that there wont be further announcements in regard to job losses
6675515 essential oils are not enough for me anymore i am obsessed with organic i must say
6675516 ko ichi is the originator of the it smells aveda factor
6675517 i would go to the ends of the earth to find
6675518 i am specializing in such a unique field of organic organic organic it is a most difficult challenge
6675519 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
6675520 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
6675521 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
6675522 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
6675523 the important thing to remember is that the pie gets larger over time and theres more to divide up
6675524 burn out our cash without any benefit and put everybody in turmoil
6675525 at a certain point people stop being able to install them or use them or troubleshoot them
6675526 iowa provided the best all around combination of attributes that we evaluate in an important selection such as this
6675527 it was a combination of things and they all came together to cause the move we saw today
6675528 other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that it will be sooner rather than later
6675529 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6675530 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6675531 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6675532 claudio says those flavors shouldnt be there in the first place
6675533 its almost hidden in the sense that you need to discover it
6675534 we want to hold up a mirror to what happens on the plantation itself and do as little as possible to get in the way
6675535 the gloves have come off to some degree in the now pitched battle between commodity bulls and bears with both scoring points
6675536 commodity markets have fully discounted the prospect of a further chinese slowdown
6675537 i think the option we would have if we were not given the six months there is a really high likelihood that we would no bid the program
6675538 its still speculative whether russia will use oil as a weapon to punish the west
6675539 but it has certainly focused the market on that geopolitical threat
6675540 the russian georgia conflict has disrupted supplies and it looks like it will drag on and create a lot of uncertainty
6675541 that to me is the most striking part about it transmitting 60 watts at 75 percent efficiency over several feet
6675542 the power pack for your laptop isnt that efficient its one of those things thats almost too good to be true
6675543 for me its like a confirmation that its so exciting its something people would like to have
6675544 now the question is if its feasible or not its exciting that theyre also inspired and it seems closer to reality every day
6675545 nur anzuprangern zwangsheirat in die schublade integrationsproblem zu schieben und nichts zu unternehmen ist ignorant
6675546 thank you jesus i didnt i wanted to see it operate first
6675547 there were no injuries and the cause is still under investigation

6675552 ill be playing the favorites along with album cuts and songs from the awakening to tell my story
6675553 ecb rate cuts are not fully discounted in the market so the euro has more downside risk
6675554 the medium term trend is still positive for the dollar against the euro and other currencies
6675555 investors dont see any factor solid enough to support yen buying beyond 108 a dollar
6675556 we continue to view recent gains in the us dollar as sustainable
6675557 despite its reputation for sunny hot and muggy weather august actually is the second wettest month of the year in galveston county it turns out that the heavy rains weve seen over the past couple of weeks are not that rare for this time of year
6675558 the chances are not slim that the dollar will be boosted by positive comments from bernanke
6675559 its very difficult now to find positive factors that will prompt investors to keep buying back the dollar actively
6675560 if the dollar rallies that may only provide a window of opportunity for players to take profits
6675561 ball high is on the right track we have work to do no doubt but overall the staff is doing a good job
6675562 twelve 14 max and theyre telling the world they are 16 what arrogance
6675563 the girls are so little so young they say they are 16 but i dont know

6675565 oh does it really matter cant we all sit around the camp fire singing koom bye yah

6675567 if china should be banned from gymnastics i imagine expelling the us from racing would be appropriate as well after the marion jones scandal right
6675568 if it was so it might be and if it were so it would be but as it isnt it aint thats logic
6675569 limitations such as age height and weight is pointless the girl earned it
6675570 it the only way the chinese can compete with the us is to lie and cheat why do you have to cheat china cant compete honestly
6675571 edged out the us gymnast nastia liukin for the gold medal in the uneven bars on monday
6675572 it went very very smoothly and professionally the whale suffered as little as possible
6675573 anticancer research is aimed at understanding the molecular pathways that can be selectively targeted to halt tumor growth
6675574 we know that the mtor pathway is activated in many cancers and therefore is a good target for fighting a wide array of tumors
6675575 we analyzed tissue from human biopsies as well as cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse models of cancer
6675576 this study inserts a new piece of information into the puzzle of the effects of mtorc1 inhibitors in cell signaling
6675577 furthermore because there are inhibitors of mapk pathway already approved for the treatment of cancer it provides us with the rationale for using combinations of mtorc1 and mapk inhibitors in attacking tumors thereby offering cancer patients another treatment option with immediate applicability
6675578 my main concern was to clear my name not about what punishment bertolino would get
6675579 i told the chief i would smile and take it for all the stuff i probably got away with over the years
6675580 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
6675581 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
6675582 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
6675583 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
6675584 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays today said doug logan new ceo of usa track amp field
6675585 once the games are complete we will be conducting a comprehensive review of our program the review will include assessments from inside and outside the usatf family included in this assessment will be the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6675586 people say if it hits your hand you should have it im a veteran ive never dropped the stick in my life its upsetting
6675587 i thought he had it i let it go and he dropped it
6675588 i started working the turn and when i came out i was in good position
6675589 david was right there and lashawn was right there we were out in front all three of us when i tried to make my move as i usually do coming off the turn it wasnt there for some reason i dont know what it was
6675590 i knew i had the race when i was coming down the homestretch and i looked over and didnt see anybody
6675591 its a long season i started back in february and its now august your body can only take so much ive got to look past this
6675592 i didnt have any idea what was going to be a good score out here e slpsits definitely not that easy its perfect conditions youve got great weather the course is in perfect shape right now playing in the morning helped a lot the greens were a little bit more receptive
6675593 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6675594 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes

6675597 sir mark lyall grant was in pakistan recently and reportedly urged the government to give president musharraf immunity if he resigned
6675598 its the brits who have stitched the deal mark lyall grant wont put a single man a britisher or non britisher in england or in the united kingdom above the law and yet he comes here and puts the president above the law today giving safe passage out to musharraf is allowing safe passage to the next man three years down the line
6675599 be prepared there is a chance of going to the hotel to cover work in boston
6675600 after four years of constant searching and trying to get answers if you know your child is there you want to be right there
6675601 i know the search is very active and the police are strategizing right now my hope is that with the technology they have they will start looking again soon
6675602 every time the phone rings i run to see who it is and when i see the fbi agents number i cant wait to answer
6675603 with all the digs and them not coming up with something it is hard to believe
6675604 the police seem pretty confident that he is there the bungay road site and if he is i think theyll find him i think they are on the trail of whoever was involved
6675605 we arent saying for sure he isnt there are we going to go back there im not sure right now we are working on other leads and information it is an open ongoing case
6675606 the local state and federal authorities are all working on this and brainstorming
6675607 you just want answers the kindness and patience of the investigators who have children of their own helps us get through
6675608 every time you give away or sell something it is like losing another part of yourself
6675609 it is just an ache and it doesnt go away i think maybe once he is found well come to terms with it we have to know how he was murdered and if he suffered
6675610 i went through hell a lot of people did but i feel stronger in the end i know it sounds crazy but im glad i went though it i learned a lot about myself

6675615 rasulullah tidak pernah sama sekali berjabat tangan de ngan wanita bukan mahram dan inilah yang dipersetujui oleh kebanyakan ulama fiqah
6675616 namun masih ada pendapat yang mengatakan membolehkan jika berjabat tangan itu tidak berlandaskan niat yang jahat iaitu semata mata berjabat tangan dengan hujung jari sahaja secara ikhlas
6675617 kami di kampung kampung di mesir apabila kaum wanita ingin berjabat tangan dengan lelaki maka mereka melakukannya dengan berlapikkan hujung kain kelubung atau mengalaskan tangan dengan sesuatu
6675618 bagaimanapun saya lebih cenderung kepada pendapat tidak boleh berjabat tangan antara lelaki dan wanita yang bukan mahramnya kerana tidak ada nas rasulullah pernah melakukannya
6675619 jadi mufti perlu membuang tekanan yang mempengaruhinya dan adat diwarisi kecuali ia berdasarkan nas dari al quran atau sunnah
6675620 sebelum mengupas isu ini saya suka mengenepikan dua perkara yang saya tahu wujud persetujuan di kalangan pakar undang undang muslim
6675621 dan mana mana perempuan tua yang telah putus kedatangan haid yang tidak mempunyai harapan berkahwin lagi maka tidak ada salahnya mereka menanggalkan pakaian luarnya dengan tidak bertujuan mendedahkan perhiasan mereka dalam pada itu menjaga kehormatan lebih baik bagi mereka dan ingatlah allah maha mendengar lagi maha mengetahui
6675622 berjabat tangan dengan wanita adalah haram menurut pandangan mereka yang berpegang bahawa menutup semua badan wanita termasuk muka dan dua tangannya adalah wajib
6675623 jika memandang kepada mereka adalah haram menyentuh pun haram kerana sentuhan lebih kuat daripada memandang ia menimbulkan berahi
6675624 tetapi mereka yang menyokong pandangan ini adalah sedikit sementara majoriti pakar undang undang muslim termasuk sahabat berpendapat muka dan tangan tidak ter masuk dalam larangan
6675625 dan katakanlah kepada perempuan perempuan yang beriman itu supaya menyekat pandangan mereka daripada yang diharamkan dan memelihara kehormatan mereka dan janganlah mereka menzahirkan perhiasan tubuh mereka kecuali yang zahir daripadanya dan hendaklah mereka menutup belahan leher bajunya dengan tudung kepala mereka dan janganlah mereka memperlihatkan perhiasan tubuh mereka melainkan kepada suami mereka atau bapa mereka atau bapa mentua mereka atau anak anak mereka atau anak anak tiri mereka atau saudara saudara mereka atau anak bagi saudara mereka yang lelaki atau anak bagi saudara mereka yang perempuan atau perempuan perempuan islam atau hamba hamba mereka atau orang gaji dari orang lelaki yang telah tua dan tidak keinginan kepada perempuan atau kanak kanak
6675626 saya mencari nas menyakinkan untuk menyokong la rangan itu tetapi saya tidak menemuinya hujah paling kuat di sini ialah bagi menghalang maksud fitnah dan ini tidak syak lagi diterima apabila membangkitkan nafsu atau takut fitnah
6675627 pertama berjabat tangan di antara lelaki dan wanita yang bukan mahram hanya diizinkan apabila tiada keinginan nafsu dan kebimbangan fitnah
6675628 tetapi jika takut berlaku fitnah keinginan nafsu dan keseronokan kemudian berjabat tangan tidak diragui men jadi haram
6675629 jika satu daripada dua syarat itu tidak ada yakni akan menimbulkan keinginan nafsu atau menimbulkan fitnah di antara seorang lelaki dan mana mana wanita mahram seperti ibu saudara dan lain lain berjabat tangan menjadi haram walaupun pada asalnya dibenarkan
6675630 kedua berjabat tangan di antara lelaki dan wanita yang bukan mahram seharusnya terbatas keadaan tertentu seperti antara hubungan persaudaraan atau mereka yang mempunyai hubungan disebabkan perkahwinan
6675631 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6675632 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6675633 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6675634 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6675635 that it is all very formula ever since the goldwater era politicians have followed the same predictable game plan play for play
6675636 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
6675637 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
6675638 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
6675639 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
6675640 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
6675641 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
6675642 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
6675643 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6675644 this storm has been hanging around and hanging around and hanging around
6675645 and shes going to be around for a while longer
6675646 could probably count on a manolo more than a man
6675647 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
6675648 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
6675649 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
6675650 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
6675651 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river

6675668 the u s claims that the missile defense system made up of 10 interceptor rockets in poland and a radar installation in the neighboring czech republic will be used to defend against attacks against the so called rogue states such as iran however the missile interceptors are effective only against short range ballistic missiles and there are no rogue states within short range of poland the russian border on the other hand is just 180 kilometers from the planned site of the installation
6675669 russia is prepared to supply syria with defensive weapons the russian foreign minister said on thursday following a meeting between the two countries leaders in russias black sea resort of sochi

6675675 what if you went back time and kill your grandfather when he was still a baby
6675676 in truth though i occupy a very high position i am the hardest working man in this country
6675677 we did know that number would rise and we very consciously made this announcement while it was on the rise to tell people in advance
6675678 we were able to get through last weekend with some temporary runouts weve decided that were better off to temporarily close a small number of stations
6675679 were not able to make up all the volumes that we would like to but the fact that we have these contracts in place has given us more flexibility than we would otherwise have if we were only dealing with petro canada

6675692 they may start out with a little card table and selling a couple of things but then who is to say what else they have is all the produce made there do they grow it themselves are they going to have eggs and chickens for sale next

6675694 when every single member country of the nsg has signed the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty ctbt why should india get a free pass
6675695 pakistan has warned that carving out a huge exemption for india increases the risk of a nuclear arms race in the subcontinent why should we allow india to vastly increase its nuclear weapons programme
6675696 as the end of his term nears president bush seeks to grant india a proliferation pardon excusing its past violations of arms control norms
6675697 the us today delivered to the nsg a draft rule change for india that undermines the entire international framework to limit spread of nuclear weapons bushs proposal contains no nonproliferation controls whatsoever
6675698 nuri will be rather close to hong kong this afternoon and on friday night with a chance of a direct hit
6675699 he still has to mature i would love him to show more respect for his competitors he should shake hands with his competitors and not ignore them
6675700 weve got a lot of problems with this country and managing this relationship is going to be one of the really great challenges over the next 20 or 30 years
6675701 swimming has their lzr suits and their deeper pools we have a 6 foot 5 inch guy thats running 9 6s and beating the rest of the olympic field by two tenths of a second hes our new technology
6675702 this means a lot more to me than an nba title because im representing my country i approach each game like its the last so im trying to play it the right way
6675703 we are ready to hold the champions trophy as we are the alternate venue for the tournament
6675704 we are in a position to hold the champions trophy as sri lankais the alternative venue for the icc event
6675705 tomorrow we will try to narrow down the focus to how the text can be tightened up to satisfy all concerns we envisage another meeting in early september
6675706 but its fair to say the issues raised follow closely in line with what is in the hyde act
6675707 we feel that we have built a quality product that gives sports bloggers the ability to succeed and sports fans an easy way to find great content we have received great feedback from the bloggers in the network so far and plan to always be adding great new features
6675708 eventually we plan to have a new writer every day of the month we found that there are many sports bloggers out there that cover a certain team or niche but they also want to write about other topics union provides that
6675709 employees will not advocate their personal political views or engage in political activities defined in this policy during hours of official employment employees will not exploit students in any way to promote their personal political views
6675710 not sure if there would be retaliation to folks that shared this information
6675711 yeah were going to go old school buddy ryan as they call it around here
6675712 and well come after him every snap and put a bounty in the locker room on him
6675713 its still something really hard to do to be able to tackle with that
6675714 what i miss the most is i know he can tackle but i wish he was back there returning kickoffs for us and getting through rookie mistakes
6675715 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
6675716 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay on for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
6675717 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
6675718 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
6675719 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
6675720 this regulation is not about contraception its about abortion and conscience
6675721 this lack of knowledge of provider conscience law within the health professions can be detrimental to conscience and other rights particularly for individuals and entities with moral objections to abortion and other medical procedures
6675722 the proposed regulations and secretary leavitts public comments about them leave the door open as to whether institutions and individuals can deny access to contraception
6675723 while the rules are not identical to the draft proposal being circulated by hhs last month the agency interprets existing conscientious objection laws so broadly that it could result in women not receiving information they need to make informed healthcare decisions
6675724 it undermines the doctor patient relationship because women will now have to question whether their health care providers are giving them complete and unbiased information and the best care possible
6675725 t he issue i asked to be addressed in this regulation is not abortion or contraceptives but the legal right medical practitioners have to practice according to their conscience and patients should be able to choose a doctor who has beliefs like his or hers the department is still contemplating if it will issue a regulation or not if it does it will be directly focused on the protection of practitioner conscience
6675726 is the fear here that so many doctors will refuse that it will somehow make it difficult for a woman to get an abortion that hasnt happened but what if it did wouldnt that be an important and legitimate social statement
6675727 un buen cr tico tiene que ser en buena medida
6675728 i blocked it all out its just one of those things where you see everything perfectly and it all seems to be in slow motion
6675729 when he gets on a roll i just pull out my pompons and give a little cheer and keep smiling and clapping
6675730 thats what good blockers do when they get on a roll good luck to you
6675731 we cant come to terms with what weve gone through
6675732 it feels unreal within a day my wife and i show up at the hospital our daughter is born and declared dead later we find out she is still alive and a few hours later we are told again that she is dead
6675733 i showed up at the intensive care unit and saw that she was dead my wife will suffer from this and well have to deal with it im sure shell need psychological help
6675734 i experienced ups and downs in my career but i rose to every challenge and held out till today im very satisfied about reaching the final
6675735 i was prepared for possible difficulties and played well in the first four games but i lost for the lack of experience
6675736 i think li fought really hard today she has participated in three olympic games so she is actually more experienced than me in international competitions
6675737 but i knew i would win once i got over the first game
6675738 the final wont be easy because teammates know each other very well
6675739 the wrongful identification of ean domingo is evidence of that
6675740 the action scenes must entertain and not induce violence in people or bore them
6675741 the troughton era presented many a feminist role in the supporting cast yet the companions of the time were some of the most notable screamers in the series history
6675742 if you kill the water rate increase youll also kill the library and recreation programs their money will be taken to pay for the nacimiento water project
6675743 this is unreal they cant actually expect me to pay that somebody else should have to pay it
6675744 weve committed ourselves to remain silent on this matter mr dalidio and by extension me
6675745 the preliminary plan i believe is to obviously comply with the general plan
6675746 one of the amazing functionalities of the psp is its got a built in wifi adaptor so you can actually go and browse the internet you can grab internet radio you can actually use it for skype making phone calls from your psp to another psp or to a pc or to a land or cell phone line for that matter but theres also a functionality called remote play which connects the psp to your ps3 back at your house so if youre on the road like i am quite a bit here in new york i can actually connect to my ps3 at home in san francisco and have complete and total access to all of that content from my photos on the hard drive to my movies on the hard drive
6675747 imagine taking your psp out of your bag and youre watching a movie on a plane you land in a foreign city and youre able to pop in a gps umd and actually get complete and total navigation directions any city youre in
6675748 im willing to try something new and hope it works
6675749 weve been fighting a losing battle for the past 10 to 15 years
6675750 it will provide the pacific fisheries management council with the real on the water experience they will need to develop new ways to fix the long suf fering west coast groundfish fishery
6675751 this will help secure what remains of californias fishing heritage and working harbors promote a variety of improved fishing methods and ensure supplies of sustainably harvested seafood for consumers
6675752 everyone is trying to do good but trawlers are already fishing with the most sustainable gear
6675753 itll allow me to keep track of his grades without having to contact his teachers
6675754 were pretty truthful but sometimes on assignments we might lie about how were doing
6675755 when the report cards come it wont be such a huge shock to see the grades
6675756 i think it gives the parents a better tool to be able to have a better conversation with the teacher instead of walking into the classroom cold
6675757 students can also log in attach assignments to be turned in or look at materials they missed
6675758 well dear eloise i hope you learn something from this little experience itll serve you well to gain patience read further for what you have to do

6675762 trucking delivers america trucks transport virtually 100 percent of groceries medicine clothing appliances and even the fuel thats pumped at the local gas station
6675763 diesel fuel prices are hurting us and driving up the costs of all of these consumer goods we need a comprehensive energy plan the national conservation environment and energy independence act is part of this comprehensive solution
6675764 but we cant continue to run our business at these high prices the high cost of diesel is cutting into our already tight margins ive had a number of friends go out of business already this year
6675765 these three new programs are for customers who are feeling the pinch of fuel prices and who are looking for a greener alternative
6675766 these new programs help give customers a shorter payback period to realize their return on investment

6675781 that seems likely but no decision has been released and nobody is talking

6675849 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
6675850 mr phelps is a superior athlete by any measure but his judgment regarding the mcdonalds and kelloggs frosted flakes endorsements was either 1 ill advised by his handlers 2 the irrational product of too much blood sugar or 3 a sad triumph of greed over good ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
6675851 octagon sports agent peter carlisle is making a strategic branding mistake by aligning michael phelps to kelloggs frosted flakes and mcdonalds in this era of escalating child obesity and diabetes the last association michael phelps wants is that of junk food pusher
6675852 while michael phelps may consume thousands of calories a day and burn them off through olympic training americas kids arent so lucky theyre fat sickly and have little hope of accomplishing a single sit up much less olympic gold kids are watching and michael phelps going for the quick cash of pushing junk food at the expense of children tarnishes his image similar to an association with cigarettes or alcohol would national action against obesity and the childrens international obesity foundation implore michael phelps and all celebrities and athletes to reject offers to push more sugar fat and hazardous calories onto americas kids
6675853 as we set out to look at the causes of obesity in our film
6675854 this is unconscionable and we hope that michael phelps reconsiders his endorsement contracts
6675855 because children under five deserve environments full of healthy options not marketing venues for junk food producers

6675886 voor mij is kleinschaligheid d charme van brussel op wereldniveau is het een provinciestad ondanks zijn internationale status zit het verkeer een beetje mee dan ben je er in vijf minuten door van noord naar zuid en maar goed ook giganten als londen parijs of new york zijn zeer aangenaam voor een citytrip maar ik zou er allerminst graag wonen
6675887 mijn vader werkte bij de spoorwegen hij werd continu overgeplaatst we gaan verhuizen was voor ons ongeveer hetzelfde als iedereen aan tafel van elsene naar merelbeke ledeberg evere brugge en uiteindelijk naar kessel lo daar ben ik gebleven tot mijn huwelijk vif werkte net als ik bij de toenmalige brt en was in brussel geboren de hoofdstad of de rand leek ons dan ook voor de hand liggende keuze om te gaan wonen het werd ganshoren maar het had evengoed meise of tervuren kunnen zijn
6675888 vroeger stond er niks aan de overkant behalve een paar van die afschuwelijke amelinckx blokken met de jaren zijn er meer en meer flatgebouwen bijgekomen maar gelukkig rest er genoeg groen er staan zelfs nog een paar koeien te grazen zolang dat blijft kan ik me makkelijk verzoenen met het leven in de stad
6675889 bijna heel die tijd hebben we uitgekeken naar iets anders iets groters op een bepaald moment hebben we zelfs op het punt gestaan een heel leuk huis in grimbergen te kopen maar dat is op het laatste moment afgesprongen nu voel ik me iets te oud om er nog aan te beginnen in en uitpakken ik heb het als knaap zoveel gedaan maar nu zie ik ertegenop bovendien is ganshoren een aangename gemeente vrij rustig de uitvalswegen zijn vlakbij en wat luchtverontreiniging betreft is dit de goede kant van brussel we ook hebben weinig reden tot ontevredenheid over het gemeentebestuur de infrastructuur wordt op de meeste plaatsen mooi en netjes gehouden er is aandacht voor groen op het gemeentehuis kunnen we terecht in het nederlands
6675890 ganshoren is een gemeente die weinig of niet negatief in het nieuws komt van agressie is er weinig sprake mede door een attente aanwezigheid van blauw op straat de politie heeft me onlangs overigens nog heel aangenaam verrast we waren betrokken in een aanrijding met een irani r die man wist niet wat hij moest doen de agenten die we erbij geroepen hadden hebben dat mooi opgelost heel vriendelijk en voorkomend ik was zo onder de indruk dat ik hen heb gecomplimenteerd iets wat ze blijkbaar niet gewend waren
6675891 als ik al iets negatiefs wil aanhalen dan is het de staat van het voetpad voor onze deur aan de overzijde hebben ze het volledig vernieuwd wij zijn in de kou blijven staan oneffen losliggende tegels werkelijk niet mooi ik heb al een paar keer schriftelijk mijn beklag gedaan met als antwoord elke bewoner moet zorgen voor zijn stukje voetpad akkoord als het sneeuwruimen betreft of zout strooien bij ijzel maar als het gaat om infrastructuur
6675892 het was een verwijt dat de brt vroeger wel vaker kreeg alles speelt zich blijkbaar af op de lijn brussel antwerpen en achteraf bekeken was dat verwijt wel een beetje terecht
6675893 ik herinner me een reportage over een caf in de marollen waar het wrakhout van de maatschappij soelaas zocht daar zat werkelijk van alles mensen zonder centen ex bajesklanten die kwamen zich bedrinken om hun miserie te vergeten ze zochten een beetje troost onder lotgenoten ze konden er op de zolder slapen voor een appel en een ei met als hoofdkussen een gespannen touw je moet het gezien hebben om het te kunnen geloven daar zijn we eerst een paar dagen gewoon met onze ploeg gaan zitten om iedereen te laten wennen aan onze aanwezigheid en pas daarna hebben we de camera bovengehaald dat was echt het onderste van de emmer de vierde wereld
6675894 de markantste reportage was wellicht de mannen van de nacht over de riolen van brussel werkelijk een stad onder de stad bij mijn thuiskomst zei mijn vrouw je stinkt zeven uur in de wind zelfs na twee drie douches genomen te hebben bleef die stank in mijn huid kleven mijn cameraman die met zijn achterste in de vieze brij was gevallen stonk zo mogelijk nog harder en heeft achteraf zijn kleren moeten weggooien
6675895 niet alleen de stank was amper te harden het was ook een hallucinant schouwspel daar onder de grond een netwerk van donkere gangen zalen als kathedralen waar een soort van watervallen naar beneden donderden stel je maar eens voor dat je daar dag in dag uit moet werken arbeiders die in het water vielen moesten zelfs een paar weken het ziekenhuis in in quarantaine zon smerige boel was het nu is een deel van de riolen open voor het publiek indertijd niet dat was nog totaal onbekend terrein voor de mensen
6675896 wel heb ik het gevoel dat ik in de enige grote stad van het land woon met alle voor en nadelen van dien ik maak dankbaar gebruik van de stad mijn dagelijks leven speelt zich wel degelijk af in en rond brussel wat ik enorm apprecieer is de enorme keuze aan restaurants nu ik gepensioneerd ben en veel minder hard werk kan ik daar nog meer van genieten dan vroeger fantastisch is het dat je door de internationalisering marokkaans kunt gaan eten turks spaans grieks noem maar op in restaurants waar je mensen van dat land ook vaak ziet komen wat een goed teken is daarenboven is de prijs kwaliteitsverhouding door de bank genomen uitstekend
6675897 mijn voorkeur gaat uit naar vertrouwde adressen waar ik me thuis voel mijn vrouw houdt meer van experimenteren ze leest trouw elke week de restaurantbesprekingen in de agenda van jullie blad om ontdekkingen te doen natuurlijk heb je ook de comme chez sois van deze wereld weliswaar een vrij unieke culinaire ervaring maar ook een vrij unieke ervaring voor je geldbeugel daar zien ze me dan ook zelden
6675898 onlangs nog zijn we gaan eten bij henri langs de vlaamsesteenweg dat was vroeger een mosselkot chez henri dat ik had leren kennen bij het maken van een reportage de mosselen werden er bewaard in een groot bad naast de urinoirs het geheim van het huis was een soort melk waarin ze het goud van de zee onderdompelden jarenlang zijn mijn vrouw en ik daar over de vloer blijven komen omdat het zon unieke brusselse gelegenheid was nu is het omgevormd tot een echt restaurant maar brussels is het gebleven niet te chic een goede tafel en redelijke prijzen
6675899 brussel is aangenaam voor iemand die zoals ik een bekende kop heeft of liever gezegd h d want zodra je niet meer op het scherm komt ben je vlug vergeten vlamingen hier laten me meestal met rust franstaligen kennen mij al helemaal niet antwerpenaars zijn over het algemeen anders doa s de jan van rompaey en oe ist joeng die komen dan zelfs bij je aan tafel zitten niet dat je mij hoort klagen als je daarover begint te zeveren moet je maar een ander beroep kiezen net zoals je niet te hard moet klagen over de ongemakken van de stad als je van de geneugten kunt genieten neem nu de nabijheid van zaventem dat is een ongelooflijke luxe als er dan al eens een toestel over je hoofd komt gevlogen hoef je niet te zeuren tenzij je pal onder een route ligt zo heb ik een dokter gekend die zijn consultaties noodgedwongen in zijn kelder hield
6675900 ik heb dus geen probleem met de stad maar euforisch ga ik er nu ook weer niet over doen het is ten eerste zeker geen echt mooie stad al zijn er natuurlijk wel prachtige stukken zo ben ik ooit eens met buitenlandse vrienden de stad binnen gereden over tervuren zo mooi die mensen wisten niet wat ze zagen je kunt er niet naast kijken dat er veel van de charme van weleer teloor is gegaan maar volgens mij ontsnapt geen enkele stad daaraan zo erg vind ik het ook niet een mens moet nu eenmaal met de tijd mee beeld je brussel maar eens in zonder metro die is aangelegd ten koste van mooie dingen maar het was wel noodzakelijk dat hij er kwam
6675901 spijtig is natuurlijk wel dat de stad verstikt is door koning auto maar ja overal waar er veel mensen tegelijk willen zijn heb je die problemen nu ik heb er tegenwoordig niet te veel last van ik kan het me veroorloven de spitsuren te ontwijken niet meer voor mijn werk in de file hoeven te staan is een enorme opluchting onvoorstelbaar de uren die ik heb verloren heb zien gaan door noodgedwongen achter het stuur met mijn vingers zitten te draaien
6675902 vroeger was ik een tamelijk militante vlaming ik herinner me dat ik eens een supermarkt uit kwam met een pak onder de arm iemand hield beleefd de deur open ik dank u wel hij zut cest un flamand voor ik het goed en wel besefte had ik die man een klap verkocht gelukkig hadden enkele omstanders gehoord dat hij mij beledigd had
6675903 de tijden zijn veranderd nu brussel zo internationaal is geworden moet je niet meer zeuren van wij zijn vlamingen en jullie franstaligen al vraag ik wel dat men mijn taal spreekt in winkels en offici le instellingen maar ik eis niet dat iedereen hier nederlands met mij praat mensen die daar nu nog altijd fanatiek een punt van maken die altijd en overal nederlands willen spreken vergeten dat de wereld naar ons toe is gekomen dat je moet accepteren dat mensen engels duits frans spreken we zouden blij moeten zijn met die internationale dimensie al heb ik wel de indruk dat in winkels opnieuw steeds meer mensen je automatisch aanspreken in het frans dat getuigt niet alleen van weinig gezond verstand maar vooral van weinig respect en met respect begint en eindigt het allemaal in ons gebouw zijn er elf appartementen ik denk dat er buiten mijn vrouw en mij nog twee bewoners nederlands spreken al de rest is franstalig so what soms doen die mensen hun best om nederlands te spreken en ik doe op mijn beurt mijn best om frans te spreken dat werkt goed
6675904 die internationalisering mag dan onomkeerbaar en een verrijking maar er is ook de keerzijde van de medaille ik kan ervan genieten dat een stuk van molenbeek meer marrakesh is dan brussel zeker op een autovrije zondag maar ik kan ook begrijpen dat het anderen irriteert dat er mensen zijn vooral ouderen die zich niet meer thuis voelen zich overspoeld voelen door die andere culturen dat is volgens mij ook de grote uitdaging voor brussel die veelheid van culturen een beetje in harmonie met elkaar leren leven is er wederzijds respect dan is er geen probleem we mogen die mensen niet verwijten dat ze een andere cultuur hebben dat ze een andere religie hebben of dat ze anders leven dat is hun goed recht maar je opsluiten in een getto weigeren je aan te passen en de andere niet respecteren is uit den boze de vraag is nu in hoeverre kan het in de hand worden gehouden ik heb zo het gevoel dat het helaas niet de goede kant opgaat de rellen onlangs in anderlecht wijzen daar ook op zolang zulke jongeren geen werk hebben zal dat problemen veroorzaken
6675905 caramel is een belangrijk deel van ons leven ze komt nooit buiten ze gaat ten hoogste op het terras wat luieren in de zon we zullen haar binnenkort helaas moeten afgeven want als je het realistisch bekijkt leeft ze op geleende tijd
6675906 een voorwerp dat me na aan het hart ligt heb ik niet ik vraag me weleens af in hoeverre zou mijn leven zonder een bepaald object of instrument anders zijn en dan kom ik uit bij zaken van praktische aard mijn auto bijvoorbeeld als ik die niet meer zou hebben zou ik een totaal ander leven leiden belangrijk dus en toch zou ik zonder kunnen maar waar ik echt geen afstand van zou willen doen denk ik is mijn computer we kunnen ons amper of niet voorstellen in welke mate die technologie de wereld heeft opengegooid voor heel veel mensen mijn vak heeft het in elk geval enorm veranderd als we vroeger een onderwerp aanpakten dan begonnen mijn redacteurs in boeken te snuffelen en liepen ze naar bibliotheken voor documentatie nu tikken ze iets in en tien minuten later ligt er een duimdik dossier
6675907 ik denk ook dat we ons nog altijd niet realiseren hoe revolutionair dat internet wel is vraag maar aan de mensen hoe het werkt en de meesten zullen je het antwoord schuldig blijven niemand zelfs die kan zeggen wie de baas van het internet is ik weet wel hoe het is begonnen in het amerikaanse leger waarna het ter beschikking is gesteld van de burgers zoals de gps ook ontstaan is via de satellieten van het amerikaanse defensiesysteem maar wie kan het internet lamleggen niemand dat draait vanzelf en breidt zich voortdurend uit fascinerend is het ik kan mij bezwaarlijk nog een leven inbeelden zonder maar dan zeg ik ook onmiddellijk ik kan me ook moeilijk een leven voorstellen zonder televisie en mijn kranten welhaast elke dag begin ik nu met een uurtje kranten lezen zalig dat is iets waar ik vroeger alleen maar van kon dromen

6675963 pe piata locala a consumatorilor privati abonamentele mai putin costisitoare sunt in general cele preferate de catre clienti este probabil ca acest comportament sa se manifeste si in cazul iphone totusi acesta este un telefon premium si se adreseaza unei categorii de clienti care isi permit produse din gama premium si celor care au nevoie de acces la mai multe servicii decat simplele apeluri telefonice

6675982 we verwachten uiteindelijk meer chinese beleggers in ons aandeelhoudersbestand te krijgen daarom is het belangrijk dat we ook hier dsm beter op de kaart zetten
6675983 het is een logische ontwikkeling dat er meer interesse komt vanuit china om in ons te investeren
6675984 we hebben ooit zelf een systeem gecreeerd waarin vrij kapitaalverkeer mogelijk moet zijn je kunt daarin bepaalde partijen geen verbod opleggen om te beleggen
6675985 dat je goed moet nadenken over mogelijk andere doelstellingen die beleggers kunnen hebben
6675986 het smeken voor uitstel was slechts beeldspraak om aan te geven dat we hard gezocht hebben naar een andere oplossing
6675987 dat betekent dat ze in het tweede halfjaar boven die 8 moeten uitkomen
6675988 we zien natuurlijk ook dat er druk op de markt is in verschillende sectoren onder andere in de vastgoedmarkt in het verenigd koninkrijk en de consumentenmarkt in duitsland
6675989 maar wij zitten overwegend in tragere minder cyclische sectoren zoals transport en krijgen onze opdrachten vooral van overheden
6675990 we krijgen veel opdrachten voor het vernieuwen van installaties in bestaande oude gebouwen die moeten worden vervangen door energiebesparende installaties maar ook voor nieuwe duurzame fabrieken bijvoorbeeld in oost europa
6675991 daarentegen doen we relatief weinig grote prestigeprojecten zoals wolkenkrabbers en dat is juist het soort projecten dat kan worden uitgesteld als er geen geld voor is
6675992 meer dan 50 van onze activiteiten in het vk betreffen water
6675993 en britse waterbedrijven gaan de komende jaren in totaal gbp20 miljard investeren

6675995 laat het duidelijk zijn waar het zwaartepunt ligt de pijlen zijn erop gericht heijmans uit het slop te halen daarvoor ben ik binnengehaald en dat is mijn ambitie om de activiteiten weer goed renderend en kansrijk te maken
6675996 dan moet je ondernemer genoeg zijn om dat te zien
6675997 dat zijn dan gedachten die aandeelhouders nog niet met mij hebben gedeeld
6675998 ik zal mijn eigen energie ten volle inzetten om het vertrouwen van aandeelhouders terug te winnen

6676002 het gaat niet alleen om goed werk leveren maar ook om het contractueel goed regelen
6676003 we hebben ervan geleerd want anders zouden we nu nog steeds op dezelfde manier projecten aannemen maar bij dit soort projecten is de wet van murphy van kracht als er iets fout gaat dan gaat ook alles fout

6676018 as we see this phenomenon occurring farther and farther north and petermann is as far north as you can get it certainly adds to the concern

6676041 there was is a huge wolverine set being recently used im not even sure which lot it was built on but the look or mood of the set is according to a source who was told hoods view of things supposed to be on the dark dinghy and somber side i only know what i was told but the basics are that hood was away from the set for whatever reason shooting something else taking a day or two off and when he returned to the big somber set he was shocked to find that it had been repainted top to bottom on rothmans orders the murky scuzzy vibe was gone and a brighter and less downish look had taken its place

6676051 its just the nature of the game that you are going to have injuries from time to time overall ive been delighted with the way the team has conducted itself and the tour will prove to be very beneficial for the team going forward
6676052 were anticipating a full strength northampton team to run out tomorrow which will provide us with yet another good test for our young squad

6676058 weve got to be patient and put a few phases together

6676062 semua yang dipilih adalah ahli kmb dan setiap peserta akan diberikan bibit untuk ditanam di kawasan yang sudah dibahagi bahagikan iaitu seluas 0 42 hektar seorang
6676063 sebenarnya tanaman ini bukan suatu yang baru kerana di indonesia dan thailand mereka telah mendahului dalam bidang ini dan banyak kajian dilakukan dalam konteks penghasilan biofuel
6676064 kilang ini akan menempatkan mesin pelbagai guna yang bukan sahaja digunakan untuk memproses buah jarak tetapi juga memproses buah kelapa sawit yang banyak ditanam di sini
6676065 pihak korea mahukan kira kira 50 000 tan sebulan tetapi kita minta penangguhan kerana pengeluaran bahan mentah tidak mencukupi dengan keluasan tanaman dan penglibatan petani yang masih terbatas
6676066 kita telah memohon kepada kerajaan negeri dan juga pemilik individu untuk membangunkan tanah tanah terbiar dan umumnya mendapat reaksi yang positif
6676067 ia mencapai tempoh matang dan boleh dituai dalam tempoh 100 hari dan tidak banyak memerlukan guna tenaga kerana hampir kesemuanya dilakukan dengan jentera

6676099 when you look at a business like ours that turns over about 12 million a year and compare that to christies and sothebys which can do between 400 and 500 million in one auction of paintings you begin to understand why we think theres significant upside in this space

6676109 we cant afford to give john mccain the chance to serve out george bushs third term
6676110 the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
6676111 the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
6676112 and now he embraces the failed bush policies over the last eight years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt exactly meet my definition of a maverick
6676113 i dont think the obama campaign has done a particularly good job of linking mccain to george bush
6676114 i think obama has not delivered the message with the degree of focus and repetition he needs to be successful in a presidential campaign
6676115 the conversation lately hasnt been about bush and the state of the country its been more about obama
6676116 mccain is seen as a different kind of republican hes not seen as politically like bush when we ask people to rate the ideology of the candidates bush is way off to the right and mccain is sort of in the middle so he can be seen as an agent of change too
6676117 weve constantly got to pay attention to the need to excite our base
6676118 at the start of the election cycle the republican party was pretty dispirited after the 2006 election and in many cases that remains true today

6676127 who can stand before his indignation who can endure the heat of his anger his wrath is poured out like fire and the rocks are broken into pieces by him the lord is good a stronghold in the day of trouble he knows those who take refuge in him but with an overflowing flood he will make a complete end of the adversaries and will pursue his enemies into darkness
6676128 behold i am against you declares the lord of hosts and will lift up your skirts over your face and i will make nations look at your nakedness and kingdoms at your shame i will throw filth at you and treat you with contempt and make you a spectacle

6676130 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6676131 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6676132 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6676133 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6676134 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6676135 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6676136 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6676137 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6676138 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6676139 if you trust every web site but not a government there are so many web sites so much hearsay
6676140 these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6676141 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6676142 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6676143 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6676144 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6676145 fair play is an important aspect of the olympic movement and the ioc is responsible for ensuring that everybody is playing by the rules this issue needs to be resolved and it needs to be behind us once the ioc feels it has done everything in its power to resolve it everyone is going to have to accept that at some level
6676146 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been alluded to by certain parties
6676147 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence to 100 percent clarify the situation and put this to rest
6676148 they should not fear as there are more bidayuhs than the malays

6676151 the city has opened up and people are mixing like they did in moscow when i was there in 1980
6676152 it was right to come here in 2001 and it is the right place to be now sport has been the catalyst
6676153 i think the atmosphere has improved dramatically in the last week the challenge is to bring things to life but its unlikely that will we see another olympics of this scope and stature again
6676154 look at sydney in 2000 where the australians did well but four years later in athens they won even more golds
6676155 the structures will be in place which will hopefully deliver more success over the next 20 years sports governing bodies in britain have started to re engineer organisations
6676156 world class coaches have been brought in and we have hungry and motivated competitors those elevated levels of competition have put people on the medals rostrum here
6676157 the government must recognise that the olympics are a once in a lifetime opportunity

6676214 hopefully the same thing that my campaign has told the american people about me that i think through big decisions i get a lot of input from a lot of people and that ultimately i try to surround myself with people who are about getting the job done and who are not about ego self aggrandizement getting their names in the press but our focus on whats best for the american people i think people will see that im not afraid to have folks around me who complement my strengths and who are independent im not a believer in a government of yes men i think one of the failures of the early bush administration was being surrounded by people who were unwilling to deliver bad news or who were prone to simply feed the president information that confirmed his own preconceptions

6676265 it shows that the los angeles plan is attractive and trucking companies are biting

6676283 the enemies know they only have a few more months left to fight before winter so they are focusing all their energies on the provinces that will be inaccessible due to snowfall on the passes between pakistan and afghanistan
6676284 as you know khost has a long border with pakistan so it is easy for insurgents to get across
6676285 the isi must stop using radicalism and extremism as an instrument of policy unless the use of these young men as tools of radicalization and as weapons to promote whatever agenda they have stops we will have continued attacks
6676286 they stay in the same room and every day are told that if they make jihad on the foreigners they will go to paradise they are told that the afghan soldiers have converted to christianity at the end of 40 days all of them are asked who wants to make jihad all of them raise their hands

6676288 i am very pleased so far with the results of vita stim i have taken multi vitamins for years but have really never noticed a big difference or change in anything however with vita stim i have noticed a big change the most dramatic change to me is my energy level it starts off strong and continues all day and into the night i work at my desk about 12 hours a day and usually by mid day im dragging a bit and by night time i dont have much energy to get other chores or things done however since taking vita stim i feel great until i go to bed it is truly wonderful the other aspect to is i sleep much better im the type of person that cant turn my brain off at night and usually dont sleep well since taking vita stim i sleep through the night and wake up very refreshed and ready to go the other big change that im still monitoring is my blood pressure i am not one who likes to take any prescription medications just too many side effects for my liking i took my blood pressure before i stated vita stim which was stage 1 hypertension after 30 days i have taken it again i have dropped 10 points on my systolic and 5 points on my diastolic numbers so i am extremely happy with those results and i feel as time goes on i will only progress in a positive range i have to say i am quite surprised with my results in the fact i have tried things before and they never seem to really do everything they say well i can honestly say that vita stim does make a difference and i know i have only begun to feel the effects that it can bring to my life
6676289 about two months ago i attended a seminar presented by a new company emergent health corporation the company has developed a unique patent pending all natural supplement with ingredients that act synergistically to aid the body go about its natural work of repair and maintenance derived from high quality and purified aphanizomenon flos aquae afa a product derived from the sea to perpetuate life the product called vita stim provides a number of benefits ranging from naturally enhancing mood fighting inflammation assisting the body in the ongoing repair process and helping in the detoxification process i went to the seminar at the request of a family member who had heard about vita stim and wanted to get my opinion that night as i learned more about the health benefits of this amazing natural substance from the sea i became intrigued and decided to give it a try the results amazed even me my energy levels increased significantly and my average daily blood sugar levels showed even greater improvement than i had seen over the last 6 years i am excited to be working with emergent to share information about vita stim with health practitioners and individuals who want to learn more about the healing properties of afa and how it may benefit their health
6676290 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6676291 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6676292 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6676293 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6676314 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6676315 gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6676316 did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6676317 gene upshaws death creates a perfect storm of two huge issues for the union
6676318 first gene upshaw defined the players union over decades and now hes gone second even with him at the helm it would have been a difficult tough set of negotiations without him its going to be an even tougher challenge
6676319 after the merger i never had another i could never get another no cut contract
6676320 and i believed that if someone signed me to a contract they should be required to pay me
6676321 you guys are cattle and were the ranchers and ranchers can always get more cattle
6676322 if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known
6676323 he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6676324 gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known

6676326 the performance of team gb in the olympics is moving beyond the sublime and towards the ridiculous
6676327 we are british for heavens sake how are we supposed to cope with such a relentless diet of good news such an unprecedented glut of world beating performances
6676328 not bad for a country that has no swimming pools and very little soap
6676329 it got me pretty square then i had to go toward first base but i had to get the out as bad as it hurt i just went after it and was able to make the play
6676330 when we came inside i said im going to take my shirt off and give everybody high fives
6676331 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
6676332 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
6676333 the sinker had great action the changeup was really good tonight
6676334 it just has such action down below the hitting area out of the hand it looks like a good pitch to hit and you have to commit
6676335 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
6676336 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into

6676341 its a signal but we dont know what it means
6676342 the crack is not alarming i would say it is normal
6676343 an er visit for something thats not an emergency costs the medical center 1 200

6676388 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6676389 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6676390 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6676391 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6676404 the invention relates to improved approaches for enabling user accounts to be portable across different multi user computer systems
6676405 a user account can be stored to an external portable data store and thus the user account becomes portable hence by coupling the external portable data store to another multi user computer system a user is able to login to any supporting multi user computer system and be presented with their user configuration and user directory since the data store that stores the user account is not only external but also portable a user can simply tote the data store to the location of the multi user computer system in one embodiment the external portable data store is able to be coupled to the multi user computer system for data transfer there between
6676406 as a multi user computer system one embodiment of the invention includes at least an external data storage device and a multi user computer

6676415 prior research has suggested that the trend in strokes was increasing but our study shows declining incidence in stroke for non diabetic men both for first and recurrent stroke and in recurrent strokes in non diabetic women
6676416 the impressive decline in smoking and large decreases in cholesterol levels and to a lesser degree blood pressure levels in the population of northern sweden may have contributed to the declining incidence in both diabetic and non diabetic subjects over the study period
6676417 on the other hand we found more recurrent events among diabetic subjects than non diabetic subjects indicating a need for even more intensive secondary prevention among diabetic patients
6676418 the fact that patients with diabetes to a great extent had favorable time trends similar to those of non diabetics is particularly interesting considering that diabetic patients with heart attack from the same population did not show any positive trends over the 19 year study

6676432 fire activity and air quality conditions have generally improved since july 9
6676433 wildland fire use hands down is safer for firefighters less costly for taxpayers and less damaging to the land
6676434 every fire should be examined for the opportunity to manage for social and ecological benefits
6676435 rather than require local units to wait until the preparedness level has been reduced
6676436 i have decided to again consider controlled fires on a case by case basis
6676437 we have a lot fewer fires going on right now than we did back on july 9
6676438 so a lot of things have improved at this point

6676458 a we called the restaurant multiple times each time we reached an answering machine and a message from a person purporting to be from the restaurant claiming that it was closed at the moment
6676459 b googling the restaurant turned up an actual address and located it on a map of milan
6676460 c the restaurant sent us a link to a website that listed its menu
6676461 this is a program that recognizes the efforts restaurants put into their wine lists
6676462 this gets down to what the wine spectator is all about its not exactly wine for dummies its more wine for the gullible
6676463 this gives the appearance of paying for advertising disguised as a contest

6676473 he went so far as to lift the shirts of female students to insure the letters gp or the words gay pride were not written on their bodies
6676474 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters

6676526 this investigation is concerning for a couple of obvious reasons one of which is the damage and possible loss of life that could have occurred if the device had detonated at the mine or near somebody secondly people often unknowingly and with good intentions pick up suspicious objects which should only be handled by trained professionals

6676548 obama needs to figure out how to advertise on a mass basis that goes beyond shots of him giving inspiring speeches and talking about change its pretty easy when youve got a charismatic candidate like barack obama to just sit there and go whoa this guys great lets do 30 seconds of him talking and thats really all theyve done
6676549 celebrities like to spend their millions barack obama is no different
6676550 all the momentum was on obamas side and they figured out a way to use that momentum to basically flip him
6676551 voters respond to them based on their own emotions and values whether its a candidate or a car there are certain attributes that drive voter decisions the goal is to make sure consumers understand that the candidate can be trusted that you can identify with the candidate that he or she shares your values
6676552 identification is a pretty significant driver for voters across the board republican and democrat

6676561 we are delighted to be working with northgate to provide public health services which meet the needs of today and the challenges for the future we are constantly seeking to improve our services as well as responding to the rising costs of quality health and social care the new environmental health service will cut down bureaucracy and save valuable officer time enabling them to focus on their core tasks of promoting protecting and improving public health
6676562 effective information management is essential to building trusted public health services which place people at their heart we are committed to promoting the intelligent use of information to support healthcare improvement and social well being and are proud to be working in partnership with the islands government to support their public health services at a time when the challenges have never been greater
6676563 this is an exciting time for spatial information and i am looking forward to the challenge this is a natural step for me since all my recent work has been in this area the inspire drafting team the dnf developments and the atlantis initiative have all demonstrated what organisations can do when they have a common goal
6676564 we host and provide web access for a large diverse range of users so our firewalls and other security devices produce huge volumes of log data around 1gb per day
6676565 this was making it difficult for me to do regular security health checks and pro actively identify any emerging issues or threats
6676566 i wanted to be able to work more efficiently and improve my networks overall security stance eventia analyzer and eventia reporter were easy to deploy and give me a clear uncluttered picture of important events on the network the analysis and reporting functions are cutting my administration time by an average of two days per month this also makes detailed inspections of network traffic and devices easier
6676567 as network infrastructures get more complex organizations are increasingly looking for ways to simplify and get closer control of their security management by automating the correlation of raw log data from multiple network and security devices across the network eventia suite enables it managers to identify and react faster to threats that pose the greatest risk and frees up valuable time saving both costs and resources
6676568 we are proud to crown team stellar the winners of mods most prestigious competition for battlefield innovators
6676569 the grand challenge has proven a showcase for the wealth of talent that exists in the uk not just in large defence firms but in universities schools and even garden sheds across the nation they have brought fresh exciting ideas to the defence table which could have battle winning applications for our armed forces

6676571 we will have to help them rebuild because they are a partner in the war on terror
6676572 there are indications but not enough to make us believe that its going as fast as it should
6676573 russia should honor its commitment to withdraw the sooner the better its overdue already
6676574 we need to take a look at the strategic picture now and we need nato the european union to discuss the fact that many assumptions we have made may have changed and we need to take a hard look at this new reality
6676575 it is well that the people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system for if they did i believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning
6676576 there are some people who look with distrust upon printing press or fiat money but they overlook one of the basic facts about money it is true that we need a hard money but we should not make the mistake of associating hardness with convertibility into gold the essence of a hard money is not determined by the material of which it is composed or the material into which it is convertible the essence of a hard money is that its supply is fairly stable and there are precise limits to it in other words gold itself is a comparatively hard money because the supply of gold is inelastic bank credit convertible into gold is a very soft money because it is elastic and there are no precise limits to its supply i e it expands and contracts and a purely paper or fiat money can be hard money if we set precise limits to its supply a population standard as described above would obviously give us a much harder money than the orthodox gold credit system gave us prior to 1933 and certainly a much harder currency than the money managers are giving us today
6676577 a lot of these guys were in the dominican and venezuelan summer leagues they want to grow fast and a related factor is that when they get here theyre generally younger than the guys theyre competing with most of whom were drafted out of college so sometimes they look for a shortcut but there are no shortcuts

6676598 if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money first by inflation and then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered

6676600 in the in depth interview the interviewer usually listens for aspects of the experience that people seem to feel strongly about and tries to find out more about the nature of their feelings
6676601 wir haben in der vergangenheit immer wieder auf die probleme der migrantinnen und migranten aufmerksam gemacht und zusa tzliche gelder fu r diesen bereich gefordert diese aber nie erhalten
6676602 ist das alles nur ein gro es mi versta ndnis oder wird hier seitens der cdu der versuch unternommen mittel unter einem falschen vorwand zu streichen und die o ffentlichkeit bewu t irrezufu hren

6676604 aids ist nach wie vor eine schwere und lebensl ngliche infektionskrankheit die haupts chlich sexuell bertragen wird therapiebegleitung psychosoziale unterst tzung und rehabilitation werden in erh htem ma e nachgefragt und sind heute wichtiger bestandteil der aids hilfe arbeit zudem steht zu bef rchten da eine banalisierung der erkrankung zu einem nachlassen der pr ventions bem hungen seitens der nachkommenden generationen f hrt daher ist es oberste pflicht der ge sundheitspolitik die materiellen voraussetzungen f r pr vention jetzt zu verst rken statt in unverantwortlich weise zu k rzen
6676605 aufgrund der unzutreffenden k rzungsbegr ndung hoffe ich da es sich bei den geplanten k rzungen nur um ein bedauerliches mi verst ndnis handelt
6676606 wir haben in frankfurt von anfang an wert auf ein interdisziplin res und vernetztes betreuungsangebot gelegt die aids hilfe frankfurt war von anfang an ein wesentlicher und unverzichtbarer teil dieser hilfe
6676607 dass sich in deutschland die infektionszahlen lange auf einem vergleichsweise niedrigen niveau stabilisieren konnten ist sicherlich auch dem erfolg von pr ventionssma nahmen zu verdanken
6676608 daneben bleibt es trotz der verbesserten behandungsm glichkeiten wichtig die psychosoziale situation von infizierten und erkrankten menschen zu verbessern damit sie ein weitgehend normales leben ohne vorurteil und ausgrenzung f hren k nnen
6676609 auch in zukunft kann es uns nur in gemeinsamer anstrengung und verantwortung gelingen die betroffenen menschen zu unterst tzen und die zahl der neuinfektionen so niedrig wie m glich zu halten
6676610 was goht mi mei saudomms gschw tz vo geschtr a
6676611 die verb nde sollten bedenken dass die vereine die spielergeh lter bezahlen
6676612 ich bin froh dass ab kommender saison die freitagsspiele in l nderspielwochen wegfallen
6676613 es ist schwierig das training auf die optimale formation und die beseitigung von fehlern abzustimmen wenn sechs akteure fehlen
6676614 das ist zu riskant ich kann schlie lich nicht f nfmal wechseln
6676615 klar w re es besser wenn wir mit dem vollen kader trainieren k nnten aber l nderspielreisen treffen die gesamte bundesliga da sind wir nicht allein
6676616 i dont want anything from them and im not giving them anything
6676617 despite all the talk in the media homes are still selling all over the lower mainland
6676618 while they were able to recover their costs the days of quickly flipping homes for a large profit are over
6676619 current slowdown is a sign of a balanced market where people have time to consider what they want to buy and get it at a price that is almost always below the asking price
6676620 a bylaw like this provides the municipality with tools for that odd occasion when people are not following proper procedures for handling garbage or storing garbage
6676621 what this new bylaw would do is tidy up the current one bear management and garbage is always a concern here in whistler
6676622 if we pass the bylaw as is then just about every person in whistler would be in contravention because everyone has a barbecue sitting on their deck
6676623 and what value is there in passing a bylaw which nobody has any intention of enforcing that seems to me to be a bit of a waste of time
6676624 wanted to have a welcoming community of homes within the larger sunshine coast community
6676625 when we held the initial envisioning session for wakefield beach the response was overwhelmingly in favour of creating a beach shared by everyone
6676626 the beach is a place to gather have a picnic roast marshmallows on the bonfire celebrate holidays it is a shared amenity for the whole community that encourages neighbours to become friends
6676627 characterized by distinctive curved roof lines and an artistic use of timber and glass
6676628 high ceilings and doors that open to the outdoor living space make the landscape feel like an extension of the homes
6676629 deep green means the homes are designed to have minimal impact on the environment without sacrificing comfort or luxury
6676630 we have achieved this by incorporating sustainable features inside and outside the homes green roofs reduce heat buildup and retain water naturally and locally supplied products reduce the need for long distance transportation
6676631 we have also included energy efficient electrical appliances geothermal heating and cooling systems high performance window glazing and low flow plumbing fixture
6676632 there is no other program like it available in the americas
6676633 everybody can surf but not everybody knows the business behind how surf companies are run
6676634 jetzt werden die innenminister sich untereinander nicht mehr trauen k nnen
6676635 w hrend der vergangenen herbstkonferenz der innenminister wurde zwischen senator ehrhart k rting und dem damaligen hamburger amtskollegen nagel die absprache getroffen kollegen nach berlin zur ckholen zu wollen
6676636 man darf bei der diskussion nicht au er acht lassen dass die vom land berlin ausgebildeten 502 beamten von hamburg als vollwertige vollzugsbeamte bernommen wurden ohne dass die hansestadt sich wenigstens anteilig an den kosten f r diese ausbildung beteiligt h tte dass herr glietsch sich jetzt auch vielleicht gegen die meinung einzelner mitarbeiter f r das anschreiben entschlossen hat ist aufgrund dieser grundlage durchaus nachvollziehbar
6676637 es gibt bereits ger chte wonach ein bestimmtes bundesland einer vielzahl von bewerbern f r den gehobenen dienst empfohlen hat sich mangels eigener ausbildungsm glichkeiten in berlin zum polizisten schulen zu lassen um nach erfolgreichem durchlauf der ausbildung in das eigene land zur ckzukehren
6676638 somit w rde das finanzielle ruinierte berlin die polizeiausbildung anderer bundesl nder finanzieren ohne selbst davon profitieren zu k nnen
6676639 polizeipr sident glietsch kann auch nur die stellen besetzen und die geh lter zahlen die ihm von der politik bewilligt werden das land hamburg hat davon profitiert dass wir keine freien stellen hatten die hansestadt hat 500 gute beamte quasi auf dem silbertablett serviert bekommen
6676640 wenn hamburg uns nun davon nur sieben zur ckgeben will ist es nur clever vom pr sidenten weitere zu k dern zumal es sich bei den 21 betroffenen um kollegen handelt die ernste gr nde f r eine r ckkehr haben
6676641 wie es hinaufgekommen ist steht nicht fest da es keine beobachter gab wir vermuten dass die mutter ihren nachwuchs hinaufgetragen hat
6676642 das ist seit l ngerem geplant und hat nichts mit dem unfall zu tun
6676643 there are no regrets to many of the actions we can take now
6676644 we are talking about improving river management and restoring the flood holding and drought proofing services of flood plains and wetlands all of which can be shown to have short term economic social and environmental pay offs
6676645 the fact that they help climate proof our river basins now is an added benefit
6676646 setting biofuel targets without considering where the water to grow biomass crops will come from is a recipe for a worsening water crisis in many regions and freshwater systems less able to cope with extreme weather events
6676647 more dams for hydropower is a recipe for even more fragmented rivers that will inhibit freshwater species the food for millions adapting to climate impacts by migrating up or down river systems
6676648 restoration of the 37 sites that make up the lower danube green corridor is estimated to cost 183 million compared to damages of 396 million from the 2005 flood and likely earnings of 85 6 million per year
6676649 this is adaptation to climate impacts even if it is not planned or labeled as adaptation
6676650 this is adaptation that involves and respects the needs of local communities and people and provides immediate benefits mr pittock said
6676651 our studies show that it is often a disaster that leads to the river restoration activities that will increase resilience to climate impacts
6676652 it would make more sense to avoid or reduce the impact of disaster by restoring and strengthening our river systems now
6676653 uncertainty is no reason for not acting on climate change impacts on vital water systems we are certain there will be significant impacts even if we cant put as many decimal points on them as we would like to
6676654 he was so good to her i dont know what happened that day i cant even believe it
6676655 he was looking after the business he was back and forth almost every week
6676656 ive never heard them say they have any problems with money never they were living a top quality life i know everything she would buy would be top of the line
6676657 she had a little business problem the taxi business thats all she told me very little like a minor problem
6676658 there were rumours that the building would be demolished for a new library
6676659 when we evaluated the site it was clearly of heritage value to the area and obviously at risk as it is not listed on the citys heritage register so it was included at the last minute as one of our top 10 sites
6676660 it was part of the very earliest settlement of vancouver and provided housing for many people who worked in the downtown and in the port area
6676661 they didnt take a look at the complex and say two old heritage houses and a character building
6676662 the people who live in heatley block the majority feel very passionately about wanting to stay there
6676663 its got tons of character and it was well kept by the owners
6676664 the way this purchase was done it was very much below the radar
6676665 what came out of that was to place a library as close as possible to strathcona elementary school
6676666 and also no heritage buildings would be demolished in order to build a new library
6676667 parents got up and said we need the money now because we live in poverty
6676668 they said i do not trust you any more with our money
6676669 the old archaic paternalism way of the indian act did not exist there last night

6676677 theres been a lot of concern expressed but there was also a ruling out of the lower mainland we thought would affect the appeal boards decision
6676678 certainly we have been sensitive to the response of the community
6676679 were delighted it appears viha officials have seen the error of their ways but we also know from dealing with them they cant be trusted at face value
6676680 were going to look at some practices and aspects of seniors care where we think theres significant concern with regard to neglect accessibility placements and other care issues

6676695 somethings wrong when i have to wonder if youre wondering about me
6676696 happy birthday honey i figured you would want something special today so i invited everyone over for breakfast
6676697 here i got you this hope it wasnt too much
6676698 thanks heath you really didnt have to get me anything
6676699 ill give you my present at the pool okay i dont really want your mom to freak out on me
6676700 okay get going you guys are going to be late for your first day back to work happy birthday cam have a wonderful day
6676701 whose turn is it to drive not mine and definitely not camerons
6676702 of course you will miss i drive a brand new range rover en espa ol
6676703 a man may deal with theory and miss the whole impact of the truth
6676704 i move to terminate the city managers contract and employment with the city of fernley immediately
6676705 better management would have avoided dismissal of the community development director
6676706 the water treatment plant is necessary but there was a long period where nothing happened and the city manager was aware of the situation despite my feelings for gary my belief is that its time for a change
6676707 as i stated in december when i was first brought into this discussion this is detrimental to our city
6676708 mr bacock has not done anything that deserves termination we need to put this issue behind us and move forward
6676709 this is an issue between the council and city manager
6676710 gue berasa banget tuh dalam proses delapan hari syuting isinya gue stress semua karena biasanya kan kalo kerja sama monty sang sutradara itu selalu bercanda bercanda kalo disini nggak
6676711 monty bilang dalam memerankannya gue harus serasa memiliki beban dan terkadang beban itu gue bawa sampe ke rumah bahkan ke kehidupan sehari hari
6676712 kalo lagi di jalan menuju lokasi gue masih yang ketawa ketawa tapi pas sampe lokasi langsung berubah sampe cewek gue ngira kalo gue marah
6676713 ini ceritanya beda jadi ini tantangan baru buat gue di sini juga seru banget karena hampir tiap hari gue harus nangis yang sejadi jadinya belum pernah kan liat gue nangis

6676716 man do the blue jays ever need another mediocre utility infielder
6676717 i think its unrealistic to think hillcrest can succeed at having wii shipments to the u s banned
6676718 i find it totally unbelievable that 12 percent of sentences are outside what can legally be imposed
6676719 today nevada is well known but not known well its literary heritage is virtually incognita
6676720 the biggest little city reno including works by jack london william stafford rollan melton and bill douglass
6676721 this year however the private sector not only failed to absorb the new entrants but actually lost 7 400 jobs overall from the previous month
6676722 whatever the final funding is we will absorb that reduction
6676723 so many educators whine that weve always been underfunded which is simply not so
6676724 ive screamed ranted raved jumped up and down but i dont whine
6676725 the demoralization this system will face with a cut of 14 percent is absolutely unconscionable
6676726 i can tell you that the accreditation process does look at the resources available
6676727 i cant imagine an accreditation team not seeing that as a serious problem for us
6676728 i think our highest responsibility is that of advocacy for higher education
6676729 i think our real duty is not to be advocates but to be people who are balancing and promoting the public interest
6676730 but the system of higher education just like every other agency needs to live with the revenue we have
6676731 a sign of good faith theyre going to work with us as we build the budget
6676732 its appropriate for them to send in a budget of what they think the needs are but to be ready to suggest reductions if reductions are required
6676733 as the oldest campus we have over 300 million worth of deferred maintenance we did not reduce out maintenance budget because we cannot
6676734 we want you to go to the legislature and take the plan you passed today and say we need this money
6676735 the ongoing investigation leads us to believe there is no foul play
6676736 we know who the vehicle belongs to but it does not mean that is the person located inside the vehicle
6676737 in all likelihood it is someone that is known to the family
6676738 it was heads up racing with a lot of competition
6676739 alexs home town of bridgend had bad press recently after a shocking spate of youth suicides shes hoping that success today might provide some welcome good news for a town thats been living under a cloud
6676740 because of all the bad press that bridgend has had recently i just think that getting through would be a good bit of news that we need
6676741 today is a big deal this is where my confidence needs to deliver and i can prove to myself that i can do this
6676742 they thought that up when i said i was from bridgend
6676743 the producers wanted me to talk about it but i didnt want to just in case i offended someones family
6676744 i would much rather be known for the talent than the girl that comes from the suicide town i didnt know i was going to be on television and didnt think i would be on as much as i was
6676745 yes there are positive things happening but for so many people life is not positive we wouldnt want to trivialise what has gone on in the area
6676746 alexandra gave a wide ranging interview about issues which were relevant important and personal to her which we accurately reflected in the programme
6676747 basically weve gone from a very minimal retail base to something thats a little more substantial because of the development weve had the last few years
6676748 my impression of the ordinance is that it doesnt do anything except make a statement
6676749 the blasting cap had been activated and it had burned
6676750 this investigation is concerning for a couple of obvious reasons one of which is the damage and possible loss of life that could have occurred if the device had detonated at the mine or near somebody secondly people often unknowingly and with good intentions pick up suspicious objects which should only be handled by trained professionals
6676751 were not criticizing him but he could have killed himself or the people around him
6676752 were not speculating on why the device was there and who left it there
6676753 our first priority is safety it has not impacted our operations we continue to produce power
6676754 weve had different types of threats and protests there over the years
6676755 the blasting cap had been activated and it had burned
6676756 this investigation is concerning for a couple of obvious reasons one of which is the damage and possible loss of life that could have occurred if the device had detonated at the mine or near somebody secondly people often unknowingly and with good intentions pick up suspicious objects which should only be handled by trained professionals

6676760 gene was the epitome of what the nfl stands for he was not only a man who gave his very best on the field every game during his great career but he was a man of integrity and service off the field
6676761 it was very shocking it was very shocking news to the profession to us as players its very disappointing to hear because of all the things hes done over the years and the way hes represented us

6676769 its so great that you give nurses a place to live
6676770 its the only dry way to get around its not like you can go jogging or anything
6676771 this storm has been hanging around and hanging around and hanging around
6676772 and shes going to be around for a while longer
6676773 the repair methods given by the manufacturer in this document are based on the technical specifications current when it was prepared the methods may be modified as a result of changes by the manufacturer in the production of the various component units and accessories from which his vehicles are constructed
6676774 and if your revenues arent covering your costs youve got a problem
6676775 a culture addicted to security comfort and be all you want to be makes no time in its public or private life for sorrow or uncertainty or the end of things our hearts elbow our lives out of the way in their headlong search for safe landings and getting their needs met but what would our culture look like and how would our children think of us 50 years from now if we began to honour and teach grief as a skill as vital to our personal and cultural and spiritual life as the skill of loving
6676776 his style is poetic and he has the rhetorical gift that preachers have but hes able to bring in big ideas from left field yet somehow preserve the mystery and the elusiveness of things hes a theologian but i can count on one hand the number of times hes used the word god in my presence theres never a clich never a pat answer always an invention in the moment
6676777 my wife simone got in touch with him when i was sick
6676778 i dont actually remember it but he told me i looked very grey that concern for me was well founded
6676779 its weird but it comes squirting out everywhere in a distorted monster like way in subliminal expressions in the violence thats all around us in heavy metal in video games thats connected somehow thanatos is very much alive
6676780 id read the books about death but had not really bitten it and suddenly you understand im not going to change this im going to die i should have realized it long before in cultures that have any wisdom you get to walk alongside your death in a vital way
6676781 is an integral part of our plans to build shareholder value
6676782 fda concludes that irradiation of iceberg lettuce and spinach conducted in accordance with good manufacturing practices will reduce or eliminate bacterial populations
6676783 i hope we will see a reduction in the number of food borne illnesses
6676784 it gives the industry another tool to increase food safety
6676785 there is no reason to suspect a toxicological hazard due to consumption of an irradiated food
6676786 it is unlikely that irradiation will have significant nutritional impact on a balanced diet of raw canned and ready to eat fruits and vegetables
6676787 we dont have much concern about the safety of irradiated foods
6676788 the continued economic downturn that has been prompted by the ongoing mortgage and financial crisis as well as the increase in gasoline and diesel prices
6676789 i remember when there was no fuel available in the late 1970s and that was beyond the pale
6676790 we were losing dealers in droves and a lot of manufacturers but the overwhelming demand for the rv lifestyle and camping prevailed again
6676791 i think whats going on now is like anything else its a setback in the natural order of things weve had too many manufacturers and too many dealers more than the market could bear
6676792 if you want to be thought a liar always tell the truth
6676793 the sidewinder x6 keyboard is custom built to be a gaming and productivity hybrid
6676794 the switchable key pad sets gamers up to beat their competitors or work on an excel spreadsheet with one easy switch of the number pad making it great for work or play
6676795 urinary arsenic reflects exposures from all routes air water and food which makes it difficult to track the actual source of arsenic exposure let alone use the results from this study to establish drinking water standards
6676796 i am really competitive and i want to do something where i can put my energy in it
6676797 were both very competitive and cannot stand to lose we love to travel love to do adrenaline like things love to experience new cultures and learn
6676798 lets hope that no one will take us too seriously so we wont be recognized as a threat until its too late
6676799 most customers wont want rainforest destruction and climate change in every mouthful of cookies or crackers so our plan is to start with the most prominent brands once we get some of the top brands on our side well use the power of the pocketbook to convince the a b cs adm bunge and cargill that destroying rainforests and increasing climate change isnt smart for business or the planet
6676800 we are currently working towards having all of our company owned plantations officially rspo certified as quickly as possible in 2008
6676801 theres currently no palm oil in the world that can be proven to be sustainable
6676802 its really important for the market to step up and create demand
6676803 global production could be doubled by planting palm trees on degraded areas of borneo
6676804 the advantage is that not a tree would have to be cut
6676805 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6676806 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6676807 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6676808 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6676809 we wrote this update to answer some of the criticisms and to provide more evidence for our view of early man as prey
6676810 one major alternative theory that has gained more attention since we wrote the original book is that early man was not a hunter but was a scavenger instead
6676811 we have found that while early man may have done some scavenging it was opportunistic very little of early humans diet came from meat
6676812 not one of the more than 250 living primate species is a scavenger
6676813 once a paradigm becomes established within a scientific community most practitioners become technicians working within the parameters of the theory but rarely questioning the validity of the theory itself
6676814 we are not saying that our theory is absolutely correct and will never be disproven
6676815 but we are saying that the evidence we have today best fits the theory of man the hunted than of man the hunter
6676816 it developed from a basic judeo christian ideology of man being inherently evil aggressive and a natural killer in fact when you really examine the fossil and living non human primate evidence that is just not the case
6676817 most theories on man the hunter fail to incorporate this key fossil evidence
6676818 we wanted evidence not just theory we thoroughly examined literature available on the skulls bones footprints and on environmental evidence both of our hominid ancestors and the predators that coexisted with them
6676819 australopithecus afarensis was probably quite strong like a small ape

6676821 these early humans simply couldnt eat meat if they couldnt eat meat why would they hunt
6676822 in fact some archaeologists and paleontologists dont think we had a modern systematic method of hunting until as recently as 60 000 years ago

6676824 went to michigan the same time as michael phelps and stories of his douchiness towards girls seem to pop up with any mention of his name apparently his freshman year he was at one of the campus bars and when asked what he was majoring in he flat out said im here to major in pussy

6676829 were excited to tell atlantis stories on a bigger canvas the successes of the two original stargate dtv movies the ark of truth and continuum have shown us the opportunities that the movie format offers we have plans for both sg 1 and atlantis to remain vital as we expand the franchise
6676830 we share in the producers enthusiasm to move forward in this direction and we look forward to a strong and continued relationship on stargate atlantis in this new format
6676831 i am 16 i dont care what other people think
6676832 i think hes got the type of build that makes nfl scouts at least pay attention
6676833 hes going to have to prove it on the field obviously with what he does this season but hes got the tools hes a big powerful guy thats got some nastiness to him and those guys end up playing a long time in the nfl a lot of them
6676834 its always going to hurt the rest of my life
6676835 i really dont feel it pain in the right foot anymore
6676836 i can go full go and not have to worry about it so i finally have confidence in my body and know that it will hold up no matter what i put it through
6676837 once i knew i couldnt play defense anymore it was fine
6676838 he really has kind of taken to the position really quickly
6676839 he made a lot of strides in what i would consider a short period of time he really started to come on the middle of last year and just kind of continued that growth and fortunately he has stayed healthy enough to come to work and progress and hes put himself in a position where its going to be hard to keep him off the field
6676840 a lot of skillful guys itll be really hard on coach denbrock to keep all of us happy we all deserve starting spots
6676841 i came in my freshman year and i didnt know what the hell i was doing then i moved to offense and i didnt now what the hell i was doing this is the first year i know what im doing
6676842 300 licenced gun owners politicians and local government officials have set up a civilian militia

6676844 our cvos will help the philippine national police to secure the towns and population centres
6676845 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6676846 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
6676847 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection
6676848 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity

6676860 heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail initiating a fire induced progressive collapse that brought the building down
6676861 the investigators also reported that if the city water main had not been cut by the collapse of world trade center towers 1 and 2 wtc 1 and wtc 2 operating sprinklers in wtc 7 would likely have prevented its collapse
6676862 we recommend that building standards and codes be strengthened beyond their current intent to achieve life safety by preventing structural collapse even during severe fires like this one when sprinklers do not function do not exist or are overwhelmed by fire

6676897 ik heb de meisjes op de 4x100 meter live aan het werk gezien en ze hebben een goede indruk op mij nagelaten
6676898 bovendien waren de omstandigheden niet ideaal want de piste lag er wat nat bij kim gevaert heeft nog niet het volle pond gegeven dus er zit wel iets extra in voor die finale volgens mij heeft kim dan ook de juiste beslissing genomen om de 200 meter links te laten liggen en volledig te focussen op de 4x100 het mag dan al haar laatste grote tornooi zijn ze zou het fysiek en mentaal lastig hebben gehad om de drie te combineren bovendien schatte ik de medaillekansen bij de estafetteploeg sowieso hoger in
6676899 in de finale is alles te herdoen en door het uitvallen van enkele ploegen kunnen onze landgenoten alleen maar een plaatsje opschuiven vooral door de afwezigheid van de verenigde staten toch een van de grote favorieten stijgen de kansen van onze meisjes ik schat toch dat ze een podiumplaats kunnen veroveren jama ca en rusland zullen moeilijk te kloppen zijn maar daarachter ligt alles open wie weet zelfs een gouden medaille als alles meezit
6676900 sandilands is having a real dominance in the ruck and from that their clearances have improved as well
6676901 certainly troy simmonds and tristan cartledge our ruckmen have really got to be strong this week against sandilands not to give him the dominance in the ruck to allow their midfield area to clean up around the stoppages
6676902 nathans our best clearance player so its extremely important that hes playing this weekend
6676903 hes trained all week and as far as were concerned hes definitely in
6676904 it probably makes them a little bit light on down back particularly if we wanted to go a little bit taller but certainly theyve got luke mcpharlin to go back there to cover
6676905 patriotism must if it is to mean anything involve the willingness to sacrifice to give up something we value on behalf of a larger cause for those like probable republican nominee john mccain who have endured physical torment in service to our country no further proof of such sacrifice is necessary
6676906 let me begin with a few words about my opponent dont tell him i said this but he is an impressive fellow in many ways he has inspired a great many americans some of whom had wrongly believed that a political campaign could hold no purpose or meaning for them
6676907 i go back every few months because things are changing in iraq
6676908 i would also seize that opportunity to educate senator obama along the way
6676909 weve seen him make plenty of catches like that and im glad he didnt make it
6676910 my shoulder tightened up a little bit but im not coming out of the game because of something like that
6676911 it should be fine im not planning on missing my next start
6676912 its just as frustrating but the good thing is we won this game
6676913 if we dont win the gold medal well not get back the one we lost in atlanta
6676914 what worries is that they play very well that they have excellent players
6676915 but we are going to play the same way we have been playing until now were not going to change the way we play against nigeria we played a great match against brazil and we now expect to do the same in the final
6676916 if we dont win the gold medal well not get back the one we lost in atlanta
6676917 what worries is that they play very well that they have excellent players
6676918 but we are going to play the same way we have been playing until now were not going to change the way we play against nigeria we played a great match against brazil and we now expect to do the same in the final

6676920 at least one third of all property acquisitions involved a foreign buyer or capital partner in 2007
6676921 a number of factors are currently causing dynamic shifts in property capital throughout the world the timing of cityscape usa could not more opportune for leaders in the industry to gather and discuss recent events and their implications for investors
6676922 according to the most recent survey published by the association of foreign investors in real estate afire more than 50 of foreign investors real estate capital scheduled to be invested around the globe in 2008 1 692 billion was earmarked for investments in the us of the 700 billion in real estate assets held by the non us investors who comprise afires membership 230 billion or roughly one third of total real estate holdings are based in the us
6676923 according to data compiled for the institutional real estate universe by institutional real estate inc 77 of the 635 private equity fund offerings seeking to raise capital around the globe were focused on global and international strategies that represents roughly 420 billion of the 545 billion currently being offered by these fund managers
6676924 hes up and running and will be touch and go but if he gets the all clear hes ready to go hes making steady progress
6676925 the instance with anthony is the classical one that if were fortunate enough to make it and go through the finals series youd like to think that at some stage if its too late for him to play vfl and theyre not in the finals then its all done on the training track theyre the downsides
6676926 as much as it is a concern its not the be all and end all that you dont or do play a bloke
6676927 you can still fit a lot of work into people on the training track
6676928 they obviously lack match practice but you try to simulate that with players that are left over and hopefully get something from that
6676929 hes got a team that has performed very well playing a certain role for five or six years
6676930 so if theyre changing their gameplan or strategies because of us weve achieved something that not many other sides have been able to achieve that sydney changes their gameplan
6676931 well just have to see weve got to take into consideration all sorts of scenarios
6676932 there might be a few different structural things weve pretty much played the same plan weve had in previous seasons so there might be a few things he roos might change
6676933 i dont care for em perhaps your friends and in france
6676934 downy head was there but cargo theft background check could not name
6676935 is there anything except soak in our first tyre went pungo
6676936 i dont see how cargo theft background check scratches and how cargo theft background check could have told as much or rather a long valley cargo theft background check didnt understand before
6676937 were capable of hitting weve hit for the last 3 1 2 years and have a lot of the same guys i know we can hit but i cant tell you when its going to get going i think every guy in that room knows we can play better
6676938 i think our guys know exactly what they have to do
6676939 they know where we are at how many games we have to go and what we need to do to win
6676940 they dont hire me and they cant fire me they can complain about me all day long they can have their opinion but the active players have the vote thats who pays my salary they the retirees say they dont have anybody in the bargaining room well they dont and they never will im the only one in that room theyre not in the bargaining unit they dont even have a vote
6676941 a guy like delamielleure says the things he said about me you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6676942 i had many applicants and i picked him because i liked his energy and i liked his marketing skills and i liked what his references had to say about him
6676943 this is the problem the executive director thinks he owns the association
6676944 there is only a no 1 and there will not be a no 2
6676945 number 2 is always trying to become no 1 and never wants to wait they can always do it better they are like backup quarterbacks there is a reason they are backups
6676946 am besten helfen sie mit kochsalznasentropfen die sie ruhig regelm ig anwenden k nnen

6676948 nur wenn das nicht reicht etwa bei einem starken infekt sollten sie f r wenige tage abschwellende nasentropfen anwenden
6676949 das ist fahrl ssig und rgerlich die beamten haben sich soweit wir bisher wissen nicht an die vorgaben f r sensible personenbezogene daten gehalten
6676950 es handelt sich um ein dienstliches versagen dem wir nachgehen werden wir legen wert darauf dass unsere bedienstete sensibel mit den daten umgehen
6676951 once the games are complete we will be conducting a comprehensive review of all our programs
6676952 i like all fans of team usa am extremely disappointed with the performance of our relays
6676953 the way in which we select train and coach our relays
6676954 these are professional athletes who are the best in their field and anybody who ever ran a high school relay cringes when that baton hits the track
6676955 in the back of my mind i had to avenge my sisters loss i did it for my family and myself
6676956 it was a great fight more than anything i believe it should have been the final
6676957 for me to go up i couldnt have a slow start i had to go in there to get to the top in the very beginning i had to make sure to keep rising
6676958 nothing is clear the sport has become global and i wont take anything for granted
6676959 if we both make it to the final hopefully i will beat him the same as well
6676960 these guys have been playing well for so many years i just dont feel like i even belong
6676961 but its not really a perfect day im happy with the silver but we know we could have won all the medals
6676962 its very very popular we have the long long coasts and you see everyone come to the beach to watch volleyball and to play volleyball
6676963 beach volleyball is great because there is a good investment from our federation for the money on the tour you can win money next year well maybe offer 50 tournaments
6676964 you put a tournament together and they come if you go to rio or ipanema beach or copacabana beach you see the spots the facilities just for all the little kids theyve got beach theyve got ropes then they are going out and trying to get on the national tours
6676965 and i dont face anything that way the goal should be to win every game from here on
6676966 a mentality that last bit where you feel something you reach deep down and you want it to happen you make it happen
6676967 there have been times in the fifth or sixth inning before i was stretched out that i would get tired
6676968 not physically but more mentally now im used to it
6676969 i certainly dont want to lose 100 games but i dont want to lose 99 either
6676970 the home run thats the farthest thing away from the umpire
6676971 i think i ate too much gum and the gum has a lot of sugar
6676972 i keep telling my daughter not to eat a lot of gum and im not a good example i think my daughters will be all over me at the house i accept it
6676973 to the mound many times to check pitchers injuries but never for a cracked molar we needed a dentist that was a first for me first for the umpire
6676974 it was a tremendous game to snap our losing streak and it went right down to the wire
6676975 we knew people were writing about it everywhere now we want to win a couple more
6676976 i just try to take care of things i can control
6676977 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6676978 but i try to blank them out day to day
6676979 i like leading off and i think im a better hitter there than in any other spot
6676980 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6676981 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6676982 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6676983 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6676984 the unabridged definitely the unabridged that version leaves in every run on grotesquely involved terribly pessimistic detail its very us
6676985 they feel that mr zardari will be the best candidate for the country he will keep the federation together and promote harmony as well as national unity
6676986 the secret of our success is people first and foremost
6676987 we have a group of very talented sailors who are driven to ensure they leave no stone unturned in the quest for olympic gold medals
6676988 those sailors are supported by a great group of coaches and support staff to help them fulfil their potential
6676989 it stems from sailing from a young age in britain our federation does a fantastic job all the way from grassroots level all the way up to olympics you are backed the whole way
6676990 sailing is not just about the helm and the crew to win you have to be a team
6676991 the problem is that the government is powerless to be able to take steps to force him to come back
6676992 there is no definitive link between the outbreak and the product at this time
6676993 our investigation includes a lot of sampling and of course with regard to sampling and testing that takes time
6676994 its a possibility their illness was caused by that but they also ate other high risk foods for listeria
6676995 so its going to be difficult to ever prove it without a doubt
6676996 the cause of death was not deemed to be listeria
6676997 frankly i think were surprised equally so that this has happened and im not sure blame can be placed on anybody for this situation but i do want to reiterate that sanitation is held to the highest standards
6676998 last week optus ceo paul osullivan claimed telstra was holding up the nbn by not complying with its network information requirements
6676999 this confirmation demonstrates that osullivans claim was a falsehood and he should now apologise for misleading the australian public
6677000 we look forward to assessing the quality of telstras information after its numerous attempts to get it right
6677001 in this particular case beauty is in the eye of the user
6677002 one party says i just got a letter na na nee na na and the department cant even acknowledge that its crazy
6677003 dont worry im still actually into guys like you but isnt two girls kissing the video
6677004 i have as much authority as the pope i just dont have as many people who believe it
6677005 im completely in favor of the separation of church and state my idea is that these two institutions screw us up enough on their own so both of them together is certain death
6677006 think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
6677007 the only good thing ever to come out of religion was the music
6677008 i dont have pet peeves i have major psychotic fucking hatreds
6677009 as we go into battle i will disguise myself so no one will recognize me but you wear your royal robes
6677010 attack only the king of israel dont bother with anyone else
6677011 he was drunk at the time of the incident he is still in custody and we will remand him if necessary
6677012 i have said many times that i will not tolerate any indiscipline or poor conduct in the force we cannot afford to have officers or men who behave like this
6677013 ja eigenlijk wel de meeste bekende nederlanders zijn in vlaanderen echt onbekend wij komen niet verder dan balkenende andr van duijn of maxim
6677014 voor mij geldt dat ook wel al heb ik wat meer met vlaanderen omdat ik in mijn jeugd in zuid limburg heb gewoond en ook wel in vlaanderen kwam maar zelfs daar zijn er absoluut verschillen tussen nederlanders en vlamingen
6677015 genoeg ik vind belgi echt een prachtig land ik heb voor de eerste aflevering zulke mooie dorpjes en plekken gezien wat me erg aanspreekt aan vlaanderen is het heerlijk rommelige het ongeorganiseerde veel leuker en gezelliger dan zon kille hollandse fenixwijk en ik heb gewoon het gevoel dat er in vlaanderen veel meer ruimte is
6677016 grappig want ik heb juist hele mooie plekken en dorpjes in n derland gezien dat is ook wel leuk aan dit nieuwe bvn programma het gaat echt over nederland n belgi het is leuk en nog leerzaam ook niet alleen over je buurland maar ook over je eigen land
6677017 haha daar moet ik echt niet aan denken mooie dorpjes en steden heeft nederland beslist hoor maar dat ten daar zou ik nooit aan kunnen wennen de ingredi nten die jullie nederlanders gebruiken zijn misschien hetzelfde als bij ons maar de belgen maken dat allemaal toch even wat beter klaar
6677018 nou ik zou z in belgi kunnen wonen niet alleen om wat ik net zei maar ook wat dat eten betreft heeft tine absoluut gelijk ik heb in een prachtig dorpje onder mechelen echt een heerlijk diner gehad
6677019 ja dat denk ik wel al was het alleen maar vanwege onze werk achtergrond karin is natuurlijk erg ervaren in dit soort programmas ik ben nog nieuw in dit facet van het vak ik kan in de studio echt merken dat ze veel rustiger is dan ik
6677020 kijk tine heeft natuurlijk vooral ervaring als actrice en dat verschil tussen ons maakt deze combinatie juist leuk en spannend want net als vlamingen en nederlanders zijn we misschien tegenpolen maar gaan we prima samen

6677026 this is a very strong atmosphere to play in and i thought we performed well

6677097 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6677098 i guess if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong

6677103 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6677104 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6677105 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured

6677137 were very close friends and hes really a family member at this point
6677138 hes totally integrated into my family aside from the fact he lives somewhere else and sometimes we dont see each other for a couple months my kids love him he is their big brother thats the thing i never anticipated ive now got two little kids myself and they absolutely look up to and idolize this kid
6677139 over time i came to believe that just by going about our ordinary lives and spending time together
6677140 he got a glimpse of what a responsible adult is supposed to do and act like he got to see how i lived got married got some kids a regular job and he got a glimpse of what a father does
6677141 texting while driving is so obviously unsafe that its hard to believe anyone would attempt it yet everyday observation suggests there are an awful lot of folks who do

6677159 i dont know what i would have done because ive never run 9 69sec these guys have trained for a long time and you would have to ask usain why he did what he did but its difficult for me to tell you i would not have done it it was a unique moment for an athlete who has worked very hard
6677160 i am not sceptical because i always believed the guy in the lane next to me was clean if a guy like me from a tiny country could run clean and go under 10 seconds 27 times in my career why cant the guy in the next lane once in a while a guy comes along who is special i have faith in usain and we all need to have faith

6677171 if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe

6677181 metsos profitable growth strategy was launched in august 2005 our progress has been strong and we are reaching the financial targets set in october 2006 one year earlier than we estimated at the time
6677182 now it is time to accelerate the strategy execution by introducing a new operating structure and more ambitious financial targets
6677183 simultaneously with enhancing our focus on the energy and environment segment automation and power businesses will naturally continue to work in close cooperation with paper and fiber segment to develop our product and service offering towards the pulp and paper industry
6677184 the decision to accelerate the strategy execution and to introduce more ambitious financial target setting shows that there is a lot of further value creation potential in metso in addition metsos board of directors and management have decided to seek other value enhancing opportunities including structural options with assistance from goldman sachs

6677190 you might want to ask them if you do a press conference with them but for me it was a tyre failure just one of those things it was a little bit unfortunate but i dont think they really found the exact cause of it
6677191 obviously i had to change at that time so i think i did something like 30 laps or so on the softer tyre but it held together quite well for me and if anything i was even more comfortable on that tyre than i was on the prime

6677265 he knew i was coming back too because he saw the desire in my eyes that i wanted to come back

6677284 i am thrilled that this wonderful choir which sings mainly in english is doing this to honour john i can promise everyone that these singers are really top quality
6677285 i am most grateful to andrew hooper for putting on a meal for them
6677286 the city has opened up and people are mixing like they did in moscow when i was there in 1980
6677287 it was right to come here in 2001 and it is the right place to be now sport has been the catalyst
6677288 i think the atmosphere has improved dramatically in the last week the challenge is to bring things to life but its unlikely that will we see another olympics of this scope and stature again
6677289 look at sydney in 2000 where the australians did well but four years later in athens they won even more golds
6677290 the structures will be in place which will hopefully deliver more success over the next 20 years
6677291 world class coaches have been brought in and we have hungry and motivated competitors those elevated levels of competition have put people on the medals rostrum here
6677292 the government must recognise that the olympics are a once in a lifetime opportunity
6677293 there is an urgent need not only to provide assistance to the growing number of displaced families
6677294 but in areas of mindanao surrounding the conflict zones it is imperative for farmers to receive seeds and fertilizers to plant rice in order to prevent severe food shortages in the coming months

6677301 georgian special units are conducting preparation for mounting terrorist attacks on the territory of and neighboring districts
6677302 they can just stage that kind of assault or attack on some of their units in order to stay here longer
6677303 steer anger among the population which can be channeled toward the government of this country
6677304 die gr ber vom paestum ausstellung im martin gropius bau berlin

6677308 well only 15 mins and ill have done the full shift so i may as well carry on im so close
6677309 the first thing we need is for brazilian clubs to develop a womens football department and youth divisions
6677310 if you dont have youth divisions you wont have anything for the future
6677311 the big clubs in brazil need to invest more in womens football to give it a lift
6677312 we need more championships because there are lots of players who are hidden away
6677313 i wanted to get that out of my system and just play golf today and i did
6677314 it was a pretty tough week but you learn from your mistakes
6677315 competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore
6677316 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices

6677323 when investors cast aside the lessons of history those lessons come back to haunt them
6677324 throughout history bull markets in commodities have lasted a long time theyve averaged about 18 years or 19 years the shortest i could find was 15 years the longest was 23 years

6677334 i am a microsoft partner however i cannot in good conscience support vista
6677335 microsoft must improve the networkability of vista and fix the lost file problems and speed issues if they cannot they should bring back xp to save face they can make some graphic changes and rename it to xp pro advanced
6677336 i have tried vista personally and i have installed it on a few of my customers computers i gave up on it myself when i couldnt print to the lower paper tray of my office printer and when my mailing label documents would not open in office 2007 i am an avid user of the windows explorer in xp and i like it the version in vista is awful i kept getting errors when i was trying to move groups of files the control panel also had me baffled with all of the re named items customers also complained and i think that i only have one that has stuck it out the rest have had me take them back to xp none of my commercial customers has switched i still sell them xp on new machines that i deliver
6677337 you said that apple and linux are not any real threat to microsoft in the enterprise
6677338 i think people dont understand the ground swell that is starting to happen i work in computers and have for more than 20 years i am at the point now that we are starting to change all the computers in the house to macs i know several co workers who are making the switch too in the one of the most recent readers digest magazines there was a listing of the things true computer people will tell you to fix your computer problems and one of them was to buy a mac although i dont see microsoft toppling any time soon people have been predicting similar things for ibm forever too i do see it continuing to lose market share to apple and linux month by month i also think that vista is one of the biggest reasons for the migration now kind of like the final straw
6677339 i set out to make a fish that worked well in top to bottom surfing but still had the fast down the line double pump blinding speed that helps it connect sections this board does an off the top snap more like a shortboard than a fish with a sleek thinned out fish foil and modern performance bottom contours it planes and drives off your front foot like that of a wider fish the long continuous curve in the outline in the last 18
6677340 the overwhelming feedback we received is that taking laptops out of their cases is for many travelers one of the most frustrating parts of checkpoint screening
6677341 so we approached the travel industry to see what they could do to help
6677342 and even with a checkpoint friendly bag if our security officer is unable to see the laptop clearly on the machine or needs to see it they will still ask the passenger to remove it from the bag
6677343 none of my suppliers have provided any information on them yet except travelon which is hoping to have them by october
6677344 in manufacturing the usual lead time is three months from design to a finished product
6677345 if it is a slow race i will win its not just about kenya and ethiopia for this event
6677346 ratan tata told me that the company will not pull out of the singur project unless forced to do so a lot of investments have already been made in the project and until and unless he was forced to pull out he will continue with the project
6677347 i tried to assure him that as far as the state governments discussion with trinamool congress was concerned the party tc will not create any law and order problem and the agitation will be peaceful
6677348 he tata is quite worried he did not anticipate that such kind of things will happen to such kind of a project
6677349 we will try to buy at the right price its a jewel
6677350 the markets had sort of assumed that this would all be over reasonably soon
6677351 noong 114 ang presyo ng krudo sa world market ang singil sa langis dito ay p38 lamang bat di nila maibaba ngayon
6677352 di na angkop yan sa ngayon noong 1995 ang 12 ng 30 per barrel ay kaya pa pero ang 12 ng 100 per barrel ay sobrang laki na di kakayanin ng taumbayan
6677353 its gonna get worse if they delay it they should think again ibigay na nila ang mga kriminal para matigil na ito hand over these criminals to stop the violence
6677354 from negotiations our focus shall shift to dialogue with the communities or government conducting authentic conversations or dialogues with the people the focus of our talks shall shift from armed groups to the community the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiment
6677355 our engagements with all armed groups shall be about disarmament demobilization and rehabilitation
6677356 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
6677357 its amazing to me when i go to the pole how thin the ice is huge open spots of water in some areas
6677358 before you spent more time getting there and more time in the ice wed have helicopters looking for breaks in the water for us
6677359 we have to ask ourselves whether were prepared for these ships coming to our shores
6677360 when everything goes wrong fall time storms tragic loss of vessels lost people on land theres nothing thats ever been so far away than the coast guard
6677361 its affecting our hunting practices in more ways than one
6677362 if you take a step back and look at it you definitely see the changes
6677363 first known instance of fire causing the total collapse of a tall building
6677364 that every effort must be made to assure the citizens of new orleans that pumps designed for flood protection will perform as specified during hurricanes
6677365 our review did not find reasonable grounds to believe that there were criminal violations or deficiencies in the pump acquisition that constituted a danger to public health or safety
6677366 we are encouraged by the prompt response to ensure that the pumps will perform when needed to provide protection for the people of new orleans
6677367 for the ninth time in the past two years moving water industries categorically denies the highly inventive scurrilous and patently false allegations by the would be whistleblower maria garzino
6677368 nous v rifions comment nous pouvons r aliser des conomies sans perdre de vue la qualit de notre production
6677369 there is no other program like it available in the americas
6677370 surfing is a multimillion dollar business i believe it would bring more experienced people into the industry
6677371 everybody can surf but not everybody knows the business behind how surf companies are run
6677372 i think very few people know how surfing contests are run and how to run them efficiently effectively and fairly
6677373 surfing has always been a countercultural activity so to my mind as it gets more institutionalized it loses some of its soul
6677374 if it gets people going to college who wouldnt go otherwise thats another huge plus
6677375 i believe that nokia and symbian the software that powers its smart phones are irrelevant companies at this point
6677376 um atleta que faz 9s69 n o tem que ouvir algu m dizer como precisa reagir um momento nico pelo qual bolt se sacrificou e treinou durante muito tempo e al m disso ele fez hist ria
6677377 n o algo planejado n o se pode prever como atuar se voc registra 9s69 em uma final voc acaba reagindo sem pensar
6677378 dizer ao mundo que fez algo que ningu m havia feito antes
6677379 bolt precisa amadurecer jovem mas deveria mostrar mais respeito com seus advers rios essa postura estaria mais de acordo com o esp rito do ideal ol mpico deveria estender a m o para os rivais ap s cruzar a linha de chegada
6677380 its like michael said the other day debbie phelps mother wants to go to rome i want to go to rome thats why were going
6677381 i was not expecting anything like this i thought it was going to be a few girls from the gym and coaches
6677382 2012 isnt out of the question right now but im taking it one day at a time
6677383 major league baseball and the media they want instant replay and were going to have instant replay so if it delays the game then theres nothing we can do about it
6677384 hopefully they let the pitchers have a few pitches just to make sure theyre loose
6677385 i was real excited to be a part of an organization that hes in because hes turned programs around hes won championships hes been around the best
6677386 and im just very excited to learn from him and play for him
6677387 for wfp and the wider un and ngo community the air hub was critical for the provision of vital relief supplies to the people of myanmar
6677388 you would think junior college running backs would be a find and gobbled up i can tell you there is a case history of jc backs not being recruited that end up doing pretty well
6677389 when it is time to hit the hole i will run somebody over and when it is time to run through them i will make a couple of cuts
6677390 i dont limit myself to just one aspect i like to do everything i can to make a big play
6677391 when i get the ball in my hands something is going to happen
6677392 he gets lost in there when he runs so nobody can see him
6677393 hes also a good pass catcher and a really good pass protector especially for his size he gets so low to the ground he comes up underneath people and leverages them
6677394 im going to try to take my time on this and make sure i get a good fit
6677395 i have quite a few applicants and im just going to wait until i get back from beijing so i dont rush it
6677396 well go with what we got tighten our belts and bear down
6677397 we have been and are working closely with the obama campaign to make sure we have an exciting and unified convention
6677398 our delegate whips along with the obama delegate whips are a part of a team that will be on the floor of the convention to make sure delegates have everything they need whether thats answering questions or passing out signs during hillarys speech the whips are a traditional part of every conventions floor operations
6677399 i think setting an artificial timetable for withdrawal is a significant mistake it is it sends mixed signals and bad signals to the region and to the iraqi citizens listen the iraqis are wondering whether or not were going to stay to help people in america wonder whether or not theyve got the political will to do the hard work
6677400 and if the congress wants to test my will as to whether or not ill accept the timetable for withdrawal i wont accept one i just dont think its in the interest of our troops i think it im just envisioning what it would be like to be a young soldier in the middle of iraq and realizing that politicians have all of a sudden made military determinations and in my judgment that would put a kid in harms way more so than he or she already is
6677401 the prime minister says what iraq and her people now need is time not a timetable they seek our patience not political posturing they require resolve not our retreat were going to succeed in iraq if given a chance liberty will succeed every time and liberty will help yield the peace we need
6677402 theres a temptation to let the politics at home get in the way with the considered judgment of the commanders thats why i strongly rejected an artificial timetable of withdrawal its kind of like an arbitrary thing you know we will decide in the halls of congress how to conduct our affairs in iraq based upon polls and politics and were going to impose this on people as opposed to listening to our commanders and our diplomats and listening to the iraqis for that matter
6677403 in the area of security cooperation the president and the prime minister agreed that improving conditions should allow for the agreements now under negotiation to include a general time horizon for meeting aspirational goals
6677404 oh well its just a stupid tournament i want to double up or quit
6677405 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6677406 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6677407 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6677408 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6677409 ive had a blast i wasnt afraid or anything im so glad i was able to embark on this journey
6677410 just another way to help them out and just another way for me to follow my passions
6677411 i wouldnt really consider myself to be particularly athletic right now
6677412 the program appears to be on the brink of collapse after an estimated half billion dollars in taxpayer funding has been spent on it
6677413 these actions would ensure that low power auxiliary operations do not cause harmful interference to new public safety and commercial wireless services in the band
6677414 these are the favored frequencies because they can be run at lower power and can be used for very high quality audio
6677415 this is gregoriava from bulgaria i saw her snatch this morning during her warm up and it was amazing
6677416 this is really a lovely horse and i speak from personal experience since i once mounted her mother
6677417 i owe a lot to my parents especially my mother and father
6677418 sure there have been injuries and even some deaths in boxing but none of them really that serious
6677419 if history repeats itself i should think we can expect the same thing again
6677420 he dribbles a lot and the opposition doesnt like it in fact you can see it all over their faces
6677421 ah isnt that nice the wife of the ioc president is hugging the cox of the british crew
6677422 she wants cydney and cynthia to be friends jodie realizes that if cydney perceives them to be one big happy family shed never sue for half her assets
6677423 you pick up the guy infront of you and fling him behind you so your in the front line now
6677424 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
6677425 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this
6677426 is accounted for and none has been compromised a thorough inventory will be a part of this stand down
6677427 barack obama is friends with ayers defending him as quote respectable and mainstream
6677428 obamas political career was launched in ayers home and the two served together on a left wing board why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6677429 dispatched his paid consultant to launch this despicable ad from a so called independent committee
6677430 instead of invoking paris britney and obscure sixties radicals sen
6677431 mr ayers is a 60 plus year old individual who lives in my neighborhood who did something that i deplore 40 years ago when i was 6 or 7 years old
6677432 by the time i met him he is a professor of education at the university of illinois we served on a board together that had republicans bankers lawyers focused on education
6677433 when the american public fully understands the close continuing relationship between their potential president and a remorseless domestic terrorist we believe it will send a chill down their spines
6677434 thats the game plan to finish out my career here
6677435 the steelers have been good to me and i have put all my heart and soul into this so ill just try to close it out
6677436 james has played at an extremely high level the entire time i have been here
6677437 not only is he an outstanding player hes also an outstanding professional and of course hes an outstanding leader for us
6677438 its not just the people that travel down it also attracts local dunedin students who join them and thats where its difficult to assess what numbers may ultimately be involved in partying
6677439 ten years ago the arts in nature festival started out small
6677440 now weve grown to a two day event with 120 plus artists and performers those who come say theyve never experienced anything like it
6677441 the purpose of it is really to inform the public about the superfund cleanup and the related state cleanups of the duwamish river but we decided to do it in a more family friendly musical way
6677442 people close to the mccain campaign also floated a wild card choice gen david h petraeus the top american commander in iraq
6677443 shana and his colleague were operating in an open area and were identifiable as civilians
6677444 a message to journalists in the gaza strip that they can come under fire any time they raise a camera
6677445 israeli soldiers enjoy an impunity that endangers many journalists covering their operations
6677446 israeli justice system has never taken proceedings against those allegedly responsible
6677447 the soldiers responsible for the death s of journalists raffaele ciriello 2002 imad abu zahra 2002 nazeh darouazi 2003 and james miller 2003 are still benefiting from an inexplicable impunity
6677448 chronic failure of the state of israel and its occupation forces to properly investigate hundreds of crimes they have committed against civilians in the opt
6677449 the latest in a long line of cases clearing idf soldiers of deadly negligence
6677450 severely curtail ing the freedom of the media to cover the conflict
6677451 f rom the beginning of 2007 to mid 2008 btselem called for investigations to be opened into 99 cases in which 189 persons were killed up to the present only 4 military police investigations have been opened
6677452 independent investigations into killings of unarmed civilians by israeli forces are virtually never carried out even in cases where international outcry forces the military advocate generals office to look into the cases the process is limited and lacks any independence and impartiality in this case as in virtually all such cases witnesses were not interviewed no proper investigation was carried out into the cases of the 13 other unarmed civilians including eight children killed that day after palestinians had ambushed and killed three israeli soldiers
6677453 reinforce the culture of impunity that has led to so many reckless and disproportionate killings of children and other unarmed civilians by israeli forces in gaza
6677454 israeli soldiers and other members of the security forces as well as israeli settlers continued in 2007 to enjoy impunity for human rights abuses committed against palestinians including unlawful killings torture and other ill treatment physical assaults and attacks on their property
6677455 the decision to indict the soldiers on such trivial grounds transmits to officers and other soldiers an extremely grave message of contempt for human life and paves the way for future cases it is hard to avoid the conclusion that a systemic defect is involved one that has spread not only among idf officers but also among those responsible for enforcing law and order in the army
6677456 the policy of law enforcement bodies to date has been characterized by non intervention in violence by settlers against palestinians and their property
6677457 the common method of intimidation is setting dogs at children while they are grazing the sheep and goats or on their way to or from school in many cases of violence firearms are also used one of the most grievous cases of abuse took place when settlers spread poison in the grazing areas used by residents killing a number of sheep t he material was extremely poisonous and was liable to seep into the groundwater
6677458 the authorities systematic failure to enforce law and order on violent settlers attacking palestinians
6677459 it is not by chance that i am using military terms to describe the settlement of the country
6677460 that was really the only suspicious thing about the letter and our national headquarters advised out of an abundance of caution for our staff and volunteers that we have the authorities check it out

6677462 voor de 97e aflevering van de zendingsdag wilden we niet weer hetzelfde draaiboek voor de dag halen
6677463 de belangstelling voor de zendingsdag verminderde in de loop van de jaren
6677464 van de duizenden mensen die in het verleden met bussen arriveerden en het terrein aan de arnhemse bovenweg bevolkten is geen sprake meer grootschalige evenementen trekken overal minder bezoekers dan vroeger
6677465 het sleutelwoord is toch ontmoeting rond de bijbel maar ook op de verschillende markten op het terrein ik zie de bezoekers voor me velen bepakt en bezakt met eten en drinken op het weer afgestemde kleding en stoelen
6677466 we hadden een goede relatie met de gemeente helaas klaagden sommige omwonenden over geluidsoverlast
6677467 we bevinden ons daar op kerkelijk terrein hydepark speelde een belangrijke rol in de geschiedenis van de nederlandse hervormde kerk en is ook nu in de protestantse kerk een plek van betekenis
6677468 mijn vader heeft er altijd voor gebeden dat een van zijn kinderen predikant zou worden
6677469 ik heb heel wat teksten in mn hoofd gehad voor de dankdienst waarin het 25 jarige ambtsjubileum wordt herdacht
6677470 zulk een is mijn liefste ja zulk een is mijn vriend
6677471 want goedereede is een stad ook al noemen veel mensen het een dorp
6677472 het is een echt kerkgebouw geworden met ook nog een goede akoestiek
6677473 de pijn van de scheuring is er en die pijn blijft maar wat het kerkgebouw betreft komt de gemeente niets tekort
6677474 we hebben in alle dingen gezien dat de heere zorgt ook als wij het soms niet weten
6677475 we hebben nu zelf dit huis kunnen kopen en het helemaal verbouwd een prachtige woning op een schitterende locatie daar zijn we echt dankbaar voor
6677476 ik was heel veel bezig met sport en deed dat ook niet echt slecht ergens in mn hart was er wel een sluimerend verlangen om predikant te worden en het evangelie te brengen maar het brak niet door wel beloofde ik de heere steeds dat ik dominee zou worden als ik kampioen zou worden in het een of ander maar met die beloften moet een mens voorzichtig zijn geloften moeten betaald worden zegt de bijbel en dat deed ik niet
6677477 ik weet nog hoe ik tijdens de begrafenisdienst het sterke verlangen kreeg om van hem te getuigen die uitkomsten geeft tegen de dood en die het antwoord is op de dood maar dominee worden ik zei laat me dan maar godsdienstleraar worden maar de heere wilde het anders en ik moest dominee worden mijn vader heeft er trouwens ook altijd voor gebeden dat een van zijn kinderen predikant zou worden de weg werd geopend de studie ging zeer voorspoedig en in augustus 1983 werd ik bevestigd in de hervormde gemeente van mastenbroek een dorpje bij zwolle
6677478 en ik heb in die gemeente ook leergeld betaald en ik blijf leren als ik nu terugkijk mag ik zeggen dat ik op de verkondiging van toen niet hoef in te houden maar ik heb wel moeten leren om de dingen wat tactischer te zeggen ik was soms te enthousiast en deed of zei ook wel eens dingen waarvan ik nu zeg dat was dom en niet verstandig dat had anders gemoeten
6677479 stiekem zag ik dat beroep als een mogelijk opstapje naar een ander beroep maar de weg was duidelijk ik moest het aannemen een totaal andere gemeente dan mastenbroek westelijker westerser wel een bondsgemeente zoals dat heet terwijl mastenbroek vanouds een iets meer confessionele inslag had
6677480 later zei de ouderling die ons had rondgeleid in de pastorie van goedereede
6677481 maar het is natuurlijk wel heel wat als je zon scheuring moet meemaken ongeveer twee derde van de kerkgangers wilde niet mee de pkn in en een derde wel dat is een moeilijke tijd geweest zowel voor de gemeente als ook voor ons gezin gelukkig is de rust ook hier wel weer enigszins weergekeerd al is de pijn niet weg

6677496 the goal has been to keep the government role to an absolute minimum
6677497 pattaya thailand is one example of what can happen if you allow the private sector free rein
6677498 if you let companies operate without proper regulation you dont get quality tourism
6677499 the world bank is generally a pro private sector organization and the ifc is its private sector arm so i would think they would be very inclined towards private interests this law seems to make that clear
6677500 we consider that the public and private sector are in cooperation

6677544 he has come from above and is greater than anyone else we are of the earth and we speak of earthly things but he has come from heaven and is greater than anyone else he testifies about what he has seen and heard but how few believe what he tells them anyone who accepts his testimony can affirm that god is true for he is sent by god he speaks gods words for god gives him the spirit without limit the father loves his son and has put everything into his hands and anyone who believes in gods son has eternal life anyone who doesnt obey the son will never experience eternal life but remains under gods angry judgment

6677587 niameys privately owned media are being forced with increasing frequency to submit to decrees that are clearly being issued for purely political reasons
6677588 this is a disturbing development especially as the authorities no longer offer any clear explanation to the media they punish
6677589 the authorities can always brush aside our protests as coming from abroad but they cannot continue to hide behind respect for nigers sovereignty if they break their own rules
6677590 we do not understand why they took this decision today and why we have not even been allowed the right to defend ourselves
6677591 im captain of this team and i want so badly to win gold
6677592 if theres anything i know about lauren its that if she could suck it up and play and finish the wnba season she would
6677593 that tells you something about the severity of the injury she cant walk and play without getting a shot
6677594 ive been getting injected before every game and i just didnt think i could go through the rest of the season playing that way
6677595 obviously this season my focus has been the olympics and im going to give it my all
6677596 but ive made the choice to have the surgery this is something i have to do its in my best interest to have it now so that it doesnt get any worse i have a long career ahead and i dont want to jeopardize any of it
6677597 to be honest i dont feel a thing when im out there on the court
6677598 that was a little scary initially but im past that now
6677599 i dont think ive ever coached somebody whos that determined who can compartmentalize that area of the game
6677600 she just puts the pain aside and really gets after it she must really be hurting to put aside the wnba season to have that surgery
6677601 but i think she thrives on the pain i think the pain just makes her tougher and its hard for her to get tougher than she already is
6677602 lauren is one of the best players to ever touch a basketball if you ask anyone whos ever played against her shes the ultimate competitor i know shes injured but thats not going to stop her from doing what she has to do here

6677614 there are so few conifers in this area of the trail no matter how often private citizens damage publicly owned trees it is always shocking
6677615 weve quit going to any parties up the hill because theyll just talk about how awful our trees are
6677616 i hope they find whoever did it this is not the right way to go
6677617 i dont understand why anybody would do this we need more trees right now with global warming not fewer
6677618 is incorrect because only are based on mathematical models and presented results at scenarios that do not include for example solar activity
6677619 so that in two years or so there will be a small ice age that lasts from 60 to 80 years
6677620 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
6677621 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
6677622 the suns surface has been fairly blank for the last couple of years and that has some worried that it may be entering another maunder minimum the suns 50 year abstinence from sunspots which some scientists have linked to the little ice age of the 17th century
6677623 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years
6677624 this summers forecast and unusual early melting events all around the arctic serve as a dire warning of how quickly the polar regions are being affected by climate change
6677625 if norways average temperature this year equals that in 2007 the ice cap in the arctic will all melt away which is highly possible judging from current conditions
6677626 they want to watch real people having actual life experiences facing true challenges the timing is right for this type of show which makes dreams come true
6677627 there is a competitive element but the show will still be all about the jobs
6677628 the idea is to get people out of their work cubicles and into real working class jobs these are the jobs that made america great
6677629 weve never experienced more contusions while making a series before
6677630 and more broken bones seriously thankfully everybody came back alive
6677631 we needed to put a little horsepower in the show
6677632 because with wildlife theres a certain amount of danger you cant anticipate
6677633 we were all over the midwest chasing storms during the last tornado season
6677634 so far weve gotten some extraordinary footage were right in the middle of a tornado weve never asked anyone to put themselves in harms way on any of our shows were just following them when they do
6677635 the cw and our studio partner cbs paramount network television have made the strategic marketing decision not to screen 90210 for any media in advance of its premiere were not hiding anything simply keeping a lid on 90210 until 9 02 riding the curiosity and anticipation into premiere night
6677636 at the start of the year we noticed demand was increasing
6677637 we send collectors in uniform and collectors without uniform it depends on how the debtor reacts if we need to do it to collect a debt we send a collector wearing top hat and tails so his debt attracts more attention
6677638 the way these companies approach consumers often borders on being illegal

6677642 the laws addressing voyeurism are intended for areas such as a bedroom window inside a fenced backyard that have a reasonable expectation of privacy
6677643 there is no expectation of privacy in a window facing a public street
6677644 they made it sound like it was our fault like we were doing something to entice them
6677645 so its fine for them to look at us but we cant insult them
6677646 those girls have been prancing around up there harassing all of us

6677666 these facilities are giving out brochures about this wonderful superlative care one need only look at their regulatory history and see that its just not true
6677667 though we do not admit liability we chose to settle this case because we are and have been firmly committed to the well being of our residents
6677668 litigation is a long expensive process that would take our focus away from where it belongs on our residents
6677669 it was primarily viewed as an opportunity to alter and change the way care was provided for people who were still in those facilities
6677670 any leftover money will go toward improving the quality of care in the homes

6677680 he might have been really strict with us when we were growing up but he always cared
6677681 he always made sure wed get the things we wanted in life and that we would just be happy hes a strong man and he had a strong woman behind him my mom
6677682 every once in a while my mom would catch him playing chess in the back with someone since the game already was going my mom couldnt ask him to stop
6677683 even though he went to the states and became successful he still would go back to his roots to help the people of pamarawan
6677684 he liked to sit on the patio listen to stories and shoot the breeze with people
6677685 though most publishers and broadcasters lament that consumers dont or wont pay for online content that lament is nonsense consumers simply dont pay them nearly 60 million american households pay more than 400 each per year the problem is these households pay the companies that give them access to those content providers
6677686 one of the accused in a case involving guns and drugs
6677687 slander affront and defamation crimes committed in what is manifestly a public place the parliamentary chamber in front of hundreds of people
6677688 is obligatory regardless of the opinion that the public prosecutors office or any other body may have about the matter
6677689 we share the opinion that in our legal system there are laws that need to be revised and in some cases the question is posed with a certain urgency
6677690 this does not exempt state bodies and citizens from the obligation to comply with the law and it does not authorize speculative acts or erroneous interpretation against the legitimate performance of judicial bodies
6677691 trials are public except when the law or the court determines that they be held without publicity to safeguard the dignity of persons and public order or when other powerful reasons occur
6677692 does not prevent trials from being open to the public or from being publicly reported
6677693 by any of the media thus helping make effective the right of citizens to information
6677694 enjoys autonomy from other state bodies and in the exercise of their duties prosecutors as guarantors of legality are not subject to criteria other than objectivity impartiality and exclusive obedience to the law
6677695 but i just got the word about my mom who is 82 years old succumbed to pancreatic cancer moms condition has been tough for about a year now but she broke her hip on the eve of the opening ceremony and if you know anything about cancer once that trauma was added to the weight of her circumstance it was a very difficult last 14 days
6677696 grapes cherry would always say ill be fine dont worry about me
6677697 im probably in that bubble of denial that you get into when youre involved in television but the truth of the matter is i gave her all i had all my life so theres no harm in not having been there for the final moments but ive got to get home needless to say to help out with some of the work at home
6677698 we were completely supportive of whatever ron decided to do
6677699 the audience has a personal connection with him and had he not just shown up on the air people would have asked questions
6677700 ron is a big part of a lot of peoples lives on saturday night with hockey night and the olympics and other major events and people feel a connection
6677701 hes been dealing with his moms situation for a while but hes pretty private about it and doesnt talk to anybody about it and hasnt really made it a focus
6677702 i think in his mind he wants to give so much to the show that whatever it is he wont let that get in the way
6677703 but hes also a soulful type of loving man so im sure hes dealing with it in his own way i thought his announcement was handled gracefully

6677720 the subtlety of the timing of eye movements is a big one people also have a natural asymmetry for instance in the muscles in the side of their face those types of imperfections arent that significant but they are what makes people look real
6677721 theres always been control systems for different facial movements but say in the past you had a dial for controlling whether an eye was open or closed and in one frame you set the eye at 3 4 open the next 1 2 open etc this is like achieving that degree of control with much finer movements
6677722 for instance you could be controlling the movement in the top 3 4mm of the right side of the smile

6677762 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw
6677763 gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side
6677764 did everything with great dignity pride and conviction he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6677765 gene upshaws death creates a perfect storm of two huge issues for the union
6677766 first gene upshaw defined the players union over decades and now hes gone second even with him at the helm it would have been a difficult tough set of negotiations without him its going to be an even tougher challenge
6677767 after the merger i never had another i could never get another no cut contract

6677770 i want to see courtney touch the ball ben touch the ball
6677771 i think theyre just as capable we have to sort that out so were going to kind of try and force feed that just a little bit to see how were going to line up the first game
6677772 and of course i want to get my hands on some passes and do what i do best

6677777 the best returners a lot of times are running backs
6677778 theyve got the skill they see things and cut back and usually theyve got the toughness to run reckless which you want your returners to do theyre just out there running with the ball
6677779 i thought all in all this was a terrific day for us
6677780 now were into game prep so its going to be kind of cool to turn our focus to that
6677781 i really dont know im not going to say anything until the coaches give me that nod
6677782 it wasnt outstanding one way or the other but ill take that
6677783 all the guys that see this for the first time its somewhat of an eye opening experience at how serious we are about this preparation process
6677784 if opinion makers across the country are talking about it lets bring it on the table lets go the whole hog then and talk about the azadi of the entire state of jammu and kashmir lets talk about the un resolutions your channel debated this and i was surprised to know that 60 per cent of the people on the show voted in favour of this and if that is the way forward let us not shy away from it i know which way i am gonna turn

6677788 the total number of anglican bishops who pre registered was only 617 and not all of them were present conference organizers included all of the ecumenical bishops in attendance to arrive at the total of 670 present when registration closed on july 21 source the living church august 3 2008 2 agenda a instead of the classic communiqu or resolutions style of communication this years conference will produce a reflections document among the desired outcomes anticipated by this diverse group from across the communion was not so much debates position papers votes and resolutions but participation on an equal footing listening as well as speaking and the emergence of wisdom and a common mind the answer to the question how do we achieve that end was indaba source kenneth kearon in an email to lambeth attendees stand firm b and our hope is that we shall end up with a reflection from the conference that is not a set of resolutions and decisions but which does genuinely change the situation and take us forward its a difficult balance to achieve all of us are involved in making it work source archbishop williams first presidential address c the episcopal church was highly invested in shaping the conferences outcome and media coverage ruth gledhill of the london times discovered tec hired a public relations firm that developed talking points for its bishops to aid their efforts the goal of the talking points was to craft a message of unity and downplay the division in the anglican communion source ruth gledhill london times and the anglican communion institutes analysis d lgbt activists also sought to influence lambeth in spite of tecs pleas to include him bishop gene robinson was not invited to lambeth but he maintained a visible presence in the marketplace and at various fringe events a large contingent of well funded gay activists was present according to a report by anglicans united 3 three main committees a windsor continuation group formed by the archbishop of canterbury in february 2008 the windsor continuation group wcg was asked to address outstanding questions arising from the windsor report and the various formal responses from provinces and instruments of the anglican communion i the members of the group are the most revd clive handford former primate of jerusalem and the middle east chair the most revd john chew primate of south east asia the right revd gary lillibridge bishop of west texas the right revd victoria matthews former bishop of edmonton the very revd john moses former dean of st pauls london the most revd donald mtetemela former primate of tanzania consultants dame mary tanner co president of the world council of churches canon andrew norman of the archbishop of canterburys staff canon gregory cameron of the anglican communion office source anglican communion news service ii contributions observations the wcg presented its observations to the conference in three sections with the following disclaimer this document is not a report by the windsor continuation group it constitutes their preliminary observations on the life of the communion and of the current state of responses to the recommendations of the windsor report and offering some suggestions about the way forward these observations are offered to the lambeth conference for conversation and testing are they an accurate description of the current state of our life together source windsor continuation group 1 titled where we are the severity of the situation
6677789 we in this diocese and i as bishop are continuing to support relationships of fidelity and commitment and give them the full blessing of the church
6677790 i hope we could do this again and raise up another gay or lesbian but there are a lot of things in play and it is unclear
6677791 we continue to ordain anyone who has a passion for ministry
6677792 the bible does not address the matter of appropriate behaviour for those who are for whatever reason homosexual by instinct or nature
6677793 by the end of the 80s i had definitely come to the conclusion that scripture was not dealing with the predicament of persons whom we should recognise as homosexual by nature
6677794 i concluded that an active sexual relationship between two people of the same sex might therefore reflect the love of god in a way comparable to marriage if and only if it had the about it the same character of absolute covenanted faithfulness
6677795 after meeting personally today with attorney general cuomo and nasaa president karen tyler i am pleased to report that we have reached an amicable resolution and global settlement of this matter

6677810 this change is aimed at bringing fairness in tax collection whereby a car will pay taxes according to its capacity or the number of passengers it accommodates
6677811 in addition to fairness this system is going to be cost effective whereby the hustle of paper work every month will be no more and it will save time for both tax payers and rra staff
6677812 the fulcrum of the new momism is the rise of a really pernicious ideal in the late twentieth century that the socioloist sharon halys has perfectly labeled
6677813 intensive mothering insists that mothers acquire professional level skills such as those of a therapist pediatrician
6677814 the new momism is a highly romanticized and yet demanding view of motherhood in which the standards for success are impossible to meet
6677815 these recent developments in the south lead to a change in the basic premise of our peace efforts the focus of our talks shall shift from armed groups to the community the parameters governing our negotiations shall be a balance between constitutionality and public sentiment

6677824 the chances of it being lifted at some point in time are very good at the moment its still a ways away i think
6677825 we felt that weve seen some good progress i would have to say that it was a successful visit and we like what we saw
6677826 i think thats a large part of what they need to continue to focus on and if they can maintain the momentum that they started we feel fairly comfortable that it will make the right progress
6677827 i know that perhaps we have a long ways to go but im very pleased with the extent to which the gpss staff has continued to maintain our efforts to improve our financial accountability despite all the changes that occurred in leadership
6677828 the time has come to fulfill my dream now i am in the medal round and i will try my best
6677829 yes its all set and we are all prepared the boxer is motivated and focussed
6677830 just two more bouts are left he should go for gold and make our dreams come true
6677831 thats the game plan to finish out my career here
6677832 the steelers have been good to me and i have put all my heart and soul into this so ill just try to close it out
6677833 james has played at an extremely high level the entire time i have been here
6677834 not only is he an outstanding player hes also an outstanding professional and of course hes an outstanding leader for us
6677835 but in my opinion the face is the most difficult thing to draw
6677836 wir machen uns viele sorgen aber wir sind stolz auf ihn
6677837 while we would hope that all ohio businesses would make paid sick days available to their employees whenever possible we believe that this initiative is unworkable unwieldy and would be detrimental to ohios economy and we will be opposing it and asking ohioans to oppose it as a result
6677838 but the governor need not fear that our campaign will portray ohio as unfriendly to business our goal is to make ohio friendlier to working families
6677839 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6677840 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6677841 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6677842 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6677843 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6677844 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6677845 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6677846 when we thought about the amenities and handiness for our employee base as well as helping with our recruiting efforts going forward when we saw the opportunity to be on elliott we thought it very much met our needs
6677847 what the 520 bridge is like and what its future is
6677848 it was going to be bad enough to eat out of all those styrofoam containers i wanted to bring some civility to the situation so i put my silver in my suitcase just in case and what do you know it came in handy
6677849 i went there to be eddie ross to show what i was capable of and i think i succeeded in that i already have a great job but i do hope other opportunities come out of this for me maybe in television
6677850 i love to make rooms that are livable and beautiful i am also young and budget conscious so i work from the perspective that you dont have to spend a lot of money to make things look great
6677851 i had a great time and made friends for life
6677852 something that went on for hours will be shown in two or three minutes
6677853 until two or three in the morning you were ready to pass out and you had to get up the next day and work again
6677854 it was worth it i think this is something i have been preparing for my whole life
6677855 i started as a dishwasher but pretty soon i was arranging the crudite
6677856 catering in greenwich and fairfield county had a huge influence on me as a designer
6677857 i was in some of the most amazing homes i saw good and bad design modern and traditional i learned something every time i went out to cater a party or event
6677858 and i was always going out with him moving his plants around
6677859 i know how to make things look good for pictures i know how to hang a curtain for visuals rather than function i know how to take a flea market find and transform it
6677860 i think i paid 70 dollars i walked out the door of that store and felt guilty like i was stealing i knew what i had and it was a major find
6677861 watch bravo and see what happens thats all i can say the experience was wonderful grueling but absolutely wonderful
6677862 i bought an antique mantel and then lined it with cracked mirrors i angled no one can believe it doesnt work thats how real it looks
6677863 they are your best investment get one that is comfortable and of great quality you can always cover it as it gets older
6677864 for a new baby boy i might do a rattle and then get a piece of great fabric or paper and calligraphy the babys name cut the fabric or paper with some scissors that give it an interesting edge add a photograph of the baby its classy very personal and you can get all the stuff you need at the arts and craft store
6677865 it goes back to my roots as a caterer but i also use them in a decorative way
6677866 i think too many people hold off on designing their homes because they cant commit my mantra is make a decision pick the paint and make it work
6677867 am i a bad dad for letting my kid use the headset in xbox live
6677868 i am going to that gay n and hang him from a tree white power
6677869 omg youre all noobs just go hide and let me kill them all
6677870 i dont know exactly what hes been exposed to and all the names hes been called and words hes heard i cant listen in not because its not technically possible but because he doesnt want me to and hes too old to be babysat while he plays games
6677871 okay how about if we call him differently sexually oriented
6677872 my dad can beat your dad at insert game here

6677878 our readers are like us and they have a political screw loose
6677879 but part of what we wanted to do is present the huffington post as being more than politics
6677880 in light of the conclusions in the report and the history of advocacy in this province its not clear that that should be one of the priorities
6677881 its a really big deal here that idea that a disabled person could be mayor
6677882 i certainly have those thoughts as i ride around here
6677883 the way i structured my term as mayor was to prepare vancouver for 2010 falling 41 votes short out of the 2 505 ballots cast by npa delegates was a big price to pay
6677884 so its good recycling i also had to sign some legal waiver forms they were worried i might set my hair on fire
6677885 paralympic athletes really represent the best of the olympic idea
6677886 they are competing just for the sake of the sport no one has an agenda and some of the stories these athletes have are just as remarkable as those of any other athletes who fight their way back from adversity
6677887 our objective is obviously to get some clarity as to whether there is some common ground enough common ground to have a fall parliamentary agenda
6677888 were looking for common ground and the prime minister will make a determination after those meetings based on those discussions
6677889 only one person can make that decision and its the prime minister were not ruling anything in or anything out at this point
6677890 obviously the election will not be in october 2009 and its obvious i will have to analyze the parliamentary situation
6677891 its right wing ideology that goes against quebec values and destroys everything in its wake
6677892 the minister has recently confirmed with vanoc in writing that the department of canadian heritage intends to invest 20 million toward the opening ceremony of the olympic winter games in order to ensure that the event adequately reflects the priorities of the government and helps to achieve its domestic and international branding goals
6677893 the 2010 federal secretariat will be leading the effort to ensure that all of the conditions associated with the investment are incorporated into the contribution agreement these conditions will ensure that the department has appropriate input and oversight into vanocs ceremony planning
6677894 no one level of government told us which way to go
6677895 it was complete synergy there was nobody who was lobbying because what they wanted wasnt getting done
6677896 we and all canadians look forward to a memorable opening ceremony that will allow the world to see the best that canada has to offer
6677897 to ensure that the opening ceremony is truly representative of canadas cultural diversity and linguistic duality by highlighting the excellence and richness of the performances of leading canadian artists
6677898 whos the government the government is the cabinet the government is the ruling political party which is the conservative party its not the priorities of canadian people
6677899 we would be very interested to know to what level their involvement is going to be is this going to be that they have direct input into being able to override anything the creators do
6677900 theres a disturbing ambiguity in the language a lot of very very vague terms that i think have dangerous implications in terms of artistic censorship
6677901 our government wants to ensure that canadas goals are achieved through the opening ceremonies naturally we will want to be involved in the planning especially if we have invested taxpayers money
6677902 this involvement of the federal government is our very best partner helping us understand and interpret the brand we call canada to the world
6677903 these are the same people mr flaherty mr baird mr clement who are responsible for what happened in walkerton who privatized ontarios propane inspection and they want to do something equivalent about food inspections which is at the core of what the government should do
6677904 this very conservative government does not understand what is at the core of the responsibility of a government in a society
6677905 let me state on behalf of the government that our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of those that are affected
6677906 and of course id like to reiterate that our highest priority continues to be making sure that canadian families food supply is safe
6677907 ill let mr dion draw the conclusions he wants it was a discussion document certain portions of that were brought forward in the budget and put into play but the vast majority was up for discussion and has not been implemented
6677908 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself
6677909 we need to have as much control over the safety of the food as possible and by even thinking that were going to give that inspection over to the industry or part of it i think is very wrong at this time
6677910 the fact of the matter is only 2 per cent of everything we eat is being monitored right now
6677911 this new policy that is being put forward is a step in the right direction
6677912 it flies in the face of all of their stated claims in terms of consumer protection
6677913 i just think thats quite ironic for a government that came in promising transparency and accountability
6677914 when asked how many houses he owns mccain lost track
6677915 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
6677916 i guess if you think that being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
6677917 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
6677918 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6677919 one of his biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion now hes a convicted felon facing jail
6677920 escape hatches to take into account the needs of a parliamentary democracy
6677921 my houses have the wow factor which i hope will make buyers say that they want them even in this market
6677922 im aggressively lowering the price holding open houses and advertising
6677923 ive always liked toys unique features and the chance to be creative putting in amenities i know will sell
6677924 i have a passion for taking a design from blueprint to a reality that others can enjoy
6677925 i dont have a trade but i visit the construction sites every day and do whatever has to be done to finish a house on time
6677926 its very important in terms of getting to the ncaa tournament
6677927 hopefully our rpi is high enough to whether we win the conference or not we still get in
6677928 in either case well have played some very good teams and well be ready for conference
6677929 overall we didnt finish all the goals that we should have
6677930 and i think this year we dont want to end any games in a tie and we dont want to have to go into overtime
6677931 we went into overtime a lot in conference last year this year we just want to prove in regulation time we can win
6677932 whether its the starting team or the backup players i feel like no matter what we can have someone step in and fill their shoes
6677933 i think its just a matter of time for her to get settled in and play
6677934 i cant believe amy winehouse self harms shes so irritating she must be able to find someone to do it for her

6677943 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6677944 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6677945 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6677946 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing

6678046 los blogs y el periodismo son dos planos del poliedro que es la comunicaci n

6678058 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6678059 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6678087 it is completely unacceptable that members of parliament are able to sit in a bar in their workplace and drink when they should be working on behalf of the community

6678094 a lot of our work is driven by and relies on assistance from the community if people are prepared to ring up and give us information to go on we follow it up
6678095 the investigation is ongoing and we appeal to anyone who may know who she is to contact crimestoppers
6678096 otherwise it will go to inquest but we need to discuss those issues with the coroner the direction the job is going to take and how they want to handle it as the coroner makes the finding

6678100 tv will fundamentally change how we talk about imagine and experience the internet

6678168 on our very first day a nine year old boy asked me to come back tomorrow and bring him a pencil and a book to read thats all he wanted
6678169 two slightly older girls told me they had no mother and no father and asked me if i could be their dad another girl asked cory if she could come home with her and help her mother as she got beaten every night by her father
6678170 at the end of term we were invited back to nakatindi school as representatives of african impact for a fundraising event called a braii this was a barbecue with local dance and music including a funny play on hiv prevention
6678171 there were speeches by the mayor of livingstone and various government ministers who we met to speak about our project and african impact
6678172 really nice to see some young shetland bred animals coming up
6678173 our committee turned out night after night to get things set up
6678174 the last time i played was in the 90s and had a lot more black hair and zap then we have just been touring all over europe to great crowds as i said we played about 10 years ago to a very enthusiastic crowd and i hope for more of the same
6678175 many of the oldest blues records contain gritty realistic lyrics no censored versions
6678176 i put my whole self into every single one of these tracks i feel like im inside of them
6678177 we all cant wait to visit the shetlands one of the must see places on some of our lists so to perform there is even better
6678178 the crowd should expect the unexpected we got a blues harp player slide guitarist too so if youre into your early delta blues even if you aint and want to hear what its all about let cherry lee mewis aka little girl blue introduce the sound to you
6678179 oh yes we are very much looking forward to visiting your islands
6678180 you know we are country boys and live out in the woods in a remote country way up north
6678181 no but seriously we have played a couple of times in scotland enjoyed it and it made us want to go further north we really are excited about playing on shetland meeting the people and trying to understand the language we hope your rough climate likes our rough blues and vice versa
6678182 our unrefined animal blues have been compared to the rough sounds of the mississippi hill country artists as well as psychoblues and garage anyway we hope that the crowd will notice and feel that we really enjoy playing and performing our original songs no two gigs are alike songs wind up different every time we play them the songs lead the way and we try to follow we like to take risks and have fun on stage
6678183 we aim to empower people to break through the circumstances which keep them trapped in poverty
6678184 this is a wonderful experience for pupils they will learn about another culture and important issues such as poverty and citizenship through music and dance the sessions will be lively rewarding and fit into curriculum for excel lence perfectly
6678185 its really exciting that grassroots are coming all the way to shetland it will be a wonderful opportunity to experi ence new things
6678186 immense in its ingrained cultural significance and intimate in the things we share with friends and family over a cup of tea
6678187 these cases and outbreaks serve as a reminder that measles can and still does occur in the united states
6678188 these cases resulted primarily from failure to vaccinate many because of philosophical or religious belief
6678189 the vaccine against measles is highly effective in preventing infections and high immunization levels in the community are effective at preventing or drastically decreasing the size of outbreaks
6678190 we are extremely pleased with the performance of the duraheart and the recovery of our patient to an excellent functional state to permit discharge we look forward to expanding upon our early experience with the duraheart in the near future
6678191 we are delighted that the fda has allowed us to begin this trial with no restriction on patient discharge which has not been true of some of the other devices currently conducting trials in the united states

6678201 but employers must include healthcare benefits as part of their compensation package in order to compete for employee talent as an employer its important to have a plan that meets your employees needs your operating budget and your long range business goals and objectives
6678202 employers today are challenged by a host of issues relating to employee benefits
6678203 the rising costs of providing employee health benefits employees lack of appreciation for benefits provided by the employer the lack of knowledge about the true value of benefits and the pressure of meeting ongoing government regulations
6678204 the intent of the survey is to provide not only large employers with effective plan benchmarks but most importantly to provide the 96 percent of employers with less than 50 employees benchmarking data that is critical in managing their programs effectively
6678205 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
6678206 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
6678207 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
6678208 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
6678209 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
6678210 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
6678211 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6678212 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6678213 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6678214 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6678215 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6678216 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6678217 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6678218 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6678219 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6678220 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
6678221 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6678222 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6678223 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
6678224 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
6678225 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
6678226 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
6678227 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
6678228 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
6678229 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
6678230 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
6678231 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
6678232 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6678233 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6678234 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6678235 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
6678236 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
6678237 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
6678238 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
6678239 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
6678240 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
6678241 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
6678242 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
6678243 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6678244 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6678245 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6678246 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6678247 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6678248 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6678249 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6678250 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6678251 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6678252 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6678253 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6678254 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6678255 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6678256 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
6678257 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6678258 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6678259 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6678260 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6678261 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
6678262 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
6678263 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
6678264 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica

6678266 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
6678267 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6678268 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6678269 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6678270 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6678271 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6678272 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6678273 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6678274 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6678275 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6678276 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
6678277 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
6678278 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
6678279 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
6678280 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
6678281 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
6678282 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
6678283 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
6678284 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6678285 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6678286 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
6678287 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
6678288 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
6678289 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
6678290 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
6678291 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6678292 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6678293 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6678294 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6678295 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6678296 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6678297 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6678298 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6678299 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6678300 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6678301 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6678302 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6678303 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6678304 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6678305 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6678306 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6678307 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6678308 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

6678323 also we must develop and diversify the productive capacity of our economy so we can better adapt to the external shocks over which we have no control
6678324 we must rebuild confidence create conducive conditions for increased investment and we must grow our economy it is for these reasons that i propose to convene a mini economic summit in the first week of september

6678331 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
6678332 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
6678333 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
6678334 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
6678335 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
6678336 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
6678337 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
6678338 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
6678339 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
6678340 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6678341 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6678342 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6678343 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6678344 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6678345 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6678346 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6678347 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6678348 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6678349 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6678350 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6678351 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6678352 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6678353 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6678354 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6678355 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6678356 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6678357 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6678358 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6678359 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6678360 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6678361 a quarter vending machine that offers three different types of candy can be bought for about 200 and the candy to fill it costs around 50 in a good location the machine can easily bring in around 25 per month that means that you can pay off the entire asset in about six months or roll your profit into a second machine after another six months you can buy two more machines this may not seem like big money but it is planting the seed for big money in the future if you dont have the money or credit for real estate this is one way to turn a couple hundred dollars into a couple thousand
6678362 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6678363 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6678364 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6678365 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6678366 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6678367 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
6678368 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6678369 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6678370 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6678371 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6678372 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6678373 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6678374 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6678375 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6678376 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6678377 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6678378 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6678379 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6678380 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6678381 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6678382 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6678383 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6678384 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6678385 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
6678386 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
6678387 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
6678388 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
6678389 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
6678390 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6678391 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6678392 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6678393 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6678394 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6678395 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6678396 the economy is stuck somewhere between sluggish growth and recession
6678397 the decline in the leading index should therefore not be interpreted as a sign the outlook is quickly deteriorating
6678398 thats critical while consumers may be cautious and conservative in their spending as long as the rate does not spike there should be enough income growth to keep the economy muddling along
6678399 the number of councilors went from 50 to 16 including the mayor salaries are significantly higher than in stoney creek and taxes have consistently gone up which was predictable
6678400 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6678401 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6678402 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6678403 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6678404 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
6678405 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
6678406 any voltage measured at vout is equal to the common mode voltage at the input of the amplifier
6678407 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6678408 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6678409 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6678410 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6678411 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6678412 here is a clear intention to open up the saudi equity market to foreign investors
6678413 we could get clarification very quickly or it could take some time

6678417 to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices

6678420 my mom in kansas city loves it when someone will talk about me as vp

6678422 the investigations found that all the mis are either insolvent on a cash flow basis a balance sheet basis or on the basis of the accounts kept by pwl have no assets or liabilities
6678423 further mis involving the growing of grapes would require members to pay more funds than they are likely to receive in revenue for the remainder of those mis
6678424 as a result none of the mis have the working capital required to continue to operate and the administrators are not aware of anyone who would be willing to contribute sufficient working capital to resolve the situation
6678425 we consider the prospects for finding such a replacement to be very low
6678426 until the economy shows some positive signs of improving trading conditions will continue to be difficult

6678451 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
6678452 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

6678491 the trick with wireless power is not can you do it its can you do it safely and efficiently
6678492 it turns out the human body is not affected by magnetic fields it is affected by elective fields so what we are doing is transmitting energy using the magnetic field not the electric field
6678493 initially it eliminates chargers and eventually it eliminates batteries all together
6678494 that is potentially a world changing event this is the closest weve had to something being commercially available in this class

6678507 in some of these cases the bears arrive so spent energetically that they literally dont move for a couple days after hitting shore
6678508 polar bears can swim quite well but they are not aquatic animals
6678509 to go out there and say they were going from this point to this point would be complete speculation

6678533 its not just me the parents of our athletes are all very indignant
6678534 they have faced groundless suspicion why arent they believed why are their children suspected their parents are very angry
6678535 what have been a number of questions and apparent discrepancies
6678536 we believe the matter will be put to rest and theres no question on the eligibility
6678537 the information we have received seems satisfactory in terms of the correct documentation including birth certificates
6678538 surely its not possible that these documents are still not sufficient proof of her birthdate
6678539 the passports were issued by the chinese foreign ministry the identity card was issued by chinas ministry of public security if these valid documents are not enough to clarify this problem then what will you believe
6678540 the chinese government and the chinese athletes must be respected
6678541 for the time being there is nothing i can add
6678542 if you trust every web site but not a government there are so many web sites so much hearsay
6678543 these are not official it is possible that all news on the internet is accurate
6678544 at this competition the japanese gymnasts were just as small as the chinese
6678545 chinese competitors have for years all been small it is not just this time it is a question of race european and american athletes are all powerful very robust but chinese athletes cannot be like that they are by nature that small
6678546 we certainly believe that its important for the ioc and the international federation to review the issue and hopefully lay it to rest because the questions surrounding the age of some of the athletes have been out there for quite a while and its unfair to them and unfair to the other athletes to continue to linger
6678547 so we have sent a letter to the ioc and to the international federation asking them to review the matter and see if they cant resolve it for the good of the competition the integrity of the competition and the good of all the athletes
6678548 fair play is an important aspect of the olympic movement and the ioc is responsible for ensuring that everybody is playing by the rules this issue needs to be resolved and it needs to be behind us once the ioc feels it has done everything in its power to resolve it everyone is going to have to accept that at some level
6678549 there have been questions that have been on the table and discrepancies that have been alluded to by certain parties
6678550 the ioc is simply wanting to do its due diligence to 100 percent clarify the situation and put this to rest
6678551 climate change is governed by hundreds of factors the very idea that we can manage climate change predictably by understanding and manipulating at the margins one politically selected factor is as misguided as it gets
6678552 disconcerting as it may be to true believers in global warming the average temperature on earth has remained steady or slowly declined during the past decade despite the continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide and now the global temperature is falling precipitously
6678553 they also wanted to kill me but when they saw i was pregnant they released me and let me live
6678554 we concluded i concluded that genocide has been committed in darfur and that the government of sudan and the janjaweed bear responsibility and that genocide may still be occurring

6678608 were fully aware that we dont have all the answers or are experts on climate change but we believe we can make a difference within our sphere of influence through the deep green programme
6678609 we know we are setting ourselves a great challenge with an ambition of 50 reduction but we want to make a real difference in this critical issue it starts with getting our stakeholders across our value chain by gradually changing their mindsets about climate change that going green can be mutually beneficial for everyone and not just another business expense

6678634 these regulations will ensure that pro life medical personnel will not be forced to engage in the unconscionable killing of innocent human life
6678635 nothing in the new regulation in any way changes a patients right to any legal procedure
6678636 its about abortion and conscience it is very closely focused on abortion and physicians conscience
6678637 this regulation does not limit patient access to health care but rather protects any individual health care provider or institution from being compelled to participate in or from being punished for refusal to participate in a service that for example violates their conscience

6678654 gene was a true pioneer as one of the few african american leaders of a major union
6678655 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6678656 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6678657 i think he was a good guy you dont always have to agree with everything somebody does to respect them
6678658 after his long career as a player he dedicated his efforts to tirelessly working to improve the salaries benefits and working conditions of generations of nfl players we talked often about common issues and i will miss those conversations
6678659 you wont find a better person in terms of taking care of former players than gene upshaw gene would do whatever is best for the players you hear all the older players who gripe and complain that we should have better this or better that they wouldnt have what they have today if not for gene upshaw
6678660 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges we worked very closely on key issues that allowed the nfl to maintain unprecedented labor peace his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6678661 with genes passing the nfl has lost an innovator players have lost their advocate and i have lost a friend a hall of fame player gene was also a hall of fame businessman and negotiator he always had the best interests of the nfl players at heart and that played a large role in building our league to the prominence it enjoys today
6678662 he was a giant in the nfl since entering the league in 1967 first as a hall of fame offensive lineman then as an active member of the collective bargaining process in the late 1970s and early 1980s and finally as executive director of the nflpa gene continually served in the best interests of the game of football he played a colossal role in the success the nfl enjoys today even more than many people realize
6678663 he was a true gentleman and his contributions to our great game first as high character highly skilled player and later as the head of the players union will never be forgotten
6678664 they said it could have been somebody drunk late at night just pulling in just crazy which makes no sense at all
6678665 maybe they were just too thirsty and got mad because i wasnt open at 2 oclock in the morning im not really sure

6678695 yeah were going to go old school buddy ryan as they call it around here
6678696 but when i got elected to the executive board of the players association i told gene i need you to be the player rep
6678697 because i saw those qualities that other people hadnt seen i knew right away that gene had the leadership and qualities to be a leader on and off the football field thats why we picked him as one of the captains of the team
6678698 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6678699 when i think about gene upshaw i think about no 63 pulling
6678700 a lot of people called it highway 63 thats what i remember and i know about gene because when he pulled around that left side he got in like a hurricane coming through wiped out everything that was there
6678701 gene was tough he just felt he couldnt get beat he had the determination to be the very best and when we drafted him mr davis knew that he would be the very best
6678702 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6678703 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6678704 a guy like delamielleure says the things he said about me you think im going to invite him to dinner no im going to break his damn neck
6678705 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6678706 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children i didnt know gene personally i just knew him professionally
6678707 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6678708 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game in the big picture
6678709 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys

6678753 if someone is looking for your house the home address numbers are literally a first impression
6678754 in truth many homeowners dont think about their house numbers its what they inherited or the builder provided
6678755 house numbers can be highly personal and give a clue to your taste inside the home
6678756 the style and placement of home address numbers should be part of a houses overall design
6678757 the numbers should contrast with the background to be easily seen but can also be made of a material that serves as a home accent such as aluminum or tile
6678758 when emergency vehicles are called to a home theres a sense of urgency

6678773 im sure if shaun signs he will relish the chance to return
6678774 its a good move for him and a good move for the club
6678775 we are always looking to improve and he is another good player
6678776 we have a good squad as it is now and we know shaun can play in a number of positions
6678777 he had a good spell at celtic the first time so im sure he will do well again
6678778 we have five or six scottish internationals in the celtic team already so he will be another good addition
6678779 i played with shaun at international level and i know what he can bring to the team
6678780 so it will be good for both club and country
6678781 i picked up an ankle injury in the first game of the season against st mirren and its been bothering me ever since but hopefully it will be okay for the weekend

6678785 our new plans at mayfair have the hallmarks of a quality kimball hill home plus a variety of new options such as morning kitchens and tech centers debuting at the community
6678786 but this is a very different ballgame now theres a lot of competition and its a sophisticated buyer
6678787 sometimes i walk into spaces and im mortified i dont know where to begin
6678788 that puts you head and shoulders above anybody else in the market
6678789 buyers may not care if you have 50 000 in decorating on the wall because they are going to do what they want anyway

6678791 the whole concept of everything north of north avenue being bucktown doesnt jibe with the fact wicker parks historic landmark district as defined both by both the nation and the city goes north of north avenue to bloomingdale avenue

6678796 its an exciting time to be in bucktown because people feel the public schools are an option for them
6678797 theres more work to be done but the community has pulled together to take over ownership of the public schools
6678798 bucktown has a large number of families with school age kids and families wanting to stay in the city that puts pressure on the schools to raise their performance and local schools have done just that
6678799 the homes people have rehabbed and renovated are really quite incredible
6678800 thats very concerning now were told at caps meetings by the police its because its an affluent community and people from other communities want what we have it seems everyone knows somebody who has had their home broken into in the last two years

6678864 a couple of years ago i did think about coming out of international retirement
6678865 i spoke to steve mcclaren a couple of times about it when he became the new coach i considered it quite strongly for a while
6678866 but in the end i came to the conclusion that i had made the right decision in the first place and i didnt want to go back
6678867 when steve was appointed he rang and asked me to return just the fact the england manager had rung and asked me to come back and play for my country meant a lot to me
6678868 he didnt have to do that but he went out of his way to ring me and also came down to training and asked if i fancied it
6678869 i did think about it but i dont really think i was ever that close that i would have said yes it wasnt about not thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just the fact that when i was playing i wasnt enjoying it one little bit
6678870 so i thought the time was right to get out and i finally decided it wasnt right to go back into it all again
6678871 i have heard little bits about the new coach thinking of asking me but i havent spoken to him
6678872 i will carry on as long as i can as long as i feel i am still contributing to united i want to carry on
6678873 when i eventually stop then i will think about what i want to do from then on if i feel i can still be of worth i will carry on if not i will go
6678874 i am sure the manager will say something as well if he turns round to me and says i am not doing enough anymore then fair enough that will be it
6678875 it is part of life i dont worry about it you get too old and you cant do what you used to you have to accept it
6678876 i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing at 35 anything after that if i am still playing well and doing something for the team then it will be a bonus

6678879 the judge there felt the government had not take enough steps or made the sufficient effort to find them and locate them
6678880 i think there was some information that was relayed from the district of kansas at the time that may have given that impression
6678881 its one thing to be arrested as a felon in possession of a firearm but its totally something else when they make up all kinds of lies

6678892 but then the chelsea players would have said exactly the same about john terry
6678893 he has been a great captain for us and hopefully he can take us all the way to the world cup finals in two years time
6678894 he knew he had a good chance of being captain and then the gaffer picked john terry so we all just get on with it now
6678895 rio has got a great attitude is a great footballer and i am sure he will take it in his stride and continue to do well for his country and united
6678896 i think we will have to play significantly better if we are to beat croatia out there
6678897 the lads are getting to know each other a lot more we know what the gaffer wants and are trying to bring that into the game

6678908 im glad he didnt make it tonight hes as good as they get out there we got a little lucky
6678909 thats a great lineup really tough no doubt about it and we know they play well at home
6678910 for us to come in here and not only win that game but win that type of game really shows that we are a playoff team
6678911 he used all of his pitches he had a couple outings where struggled but to come back against these guys is pretty good
6678912 two outs and gomez coming up behind me even if i get thrown out at second its not a bad play
6678913 were not going anywhere without our bullpen i feel great for matty he needed that
6678914 were not going to keep that lineup to one run every night
6678915 but as long as our pitchers continue to do that theyll keep us in the game and i think as long as we have good pitching we can play with anybody

6678928 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6678929 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today

6678973 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6678974 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6678975 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6678976 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6678977 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6678978 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6678979 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6678980 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6678981 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6678982 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6678983 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6678984 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6678985 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6678986 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6678987 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6678988 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6678989 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6678990 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6678991 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6678992 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6678993 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6678994 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6678995 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6678996 basically weve gone from a very minimal retail base to something thats a little more substantial because of the development weve had the last few years
6678997 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6678998 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6678999 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

6679090 we did this over thirteen years ago with web hosting with great success
6679091 our advantage then and now is our large reseller base and their individual customer bases and presence within their communities we dont have to find users or advertisers our partners and advars do this while we benefit from a lower marketing expense our resellers get to put personalized service back into an internet faceless business like paid search advertising
6679092 tybit will change the way we search and buy and now with our advar program anyone can become an internet based ad agency with just a few clicks of the mouse

6679100 earlier this year total systems had moved from my active investment stocks to my tsa watch list after an unexpectedly sharp rise in their long term debt obligations
6679101 i have known for many years of total systems dedication to corporate innovation and their ability to generate new products and services and had been monitoring their progress in bringing their long term debt to shareholder equity back in line
6679102 i have come to trust the s amp p quality rating as a supplement to my own stock selection criteria
6679103 generally but not in every case the target sell price is set at about two standard deviations from the stocks average price range
6679104 our initial stock screening process begins by searching for companies undergoing corporate innovation ci
6679105 our method is based upon a theory of technology that suggests to us that companies undergoing innovation may experience a boost in their stock price within a 3 year period

6679116 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6679117 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6679118 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6679119 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6679120 we were scrambling to find something that would get this virus out of our network
6679121 we tried everything we could think of but nothing was working and time was running out
6679122 obviously after avgs free product performed so well i owed it to the company to check out avgs commercial offerings
6679123 weve just renewed our subscriptions to avg for the fifth time
6679124 this time we decided to work with an authorized avg distributor to help the purchase and installation process go as smoothly as possible we selected walling data who ive since learned is the largest avg distributor in the country because they were offering free round the clock support as part of their already competitive license prices
6679125 we havent had any issues with avg that have required us to contact walling for support but it is reassuring to know they are there if we ever do need them it also helps that there would be no surprise charges for support if we did have a problem
6679126 we were and always will be more concerned with finding a product that we can have confidence in something that wont allow viruses to take over our network we lost our confidence in mcafee but we found it again with avg
6679127 its our goal to be as relevant as possible to as many people as we can
6679128 when i have shopped for situations like babies or weddings for gay friends i have good luck in quirky stores
6679129 but if you are just in a generic store the bride and groom symbol or words are in most cards
6679130 it becomes difficult to find some that are neutral but have some style
6679131 its not like we are wealthy people but theyll kidnap you for a watch
6679132 before they only kidnapped key well known economically successful people like industrialists and landowners now they are kidnapping people from the middle class
6679133 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6679134 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6679135 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6679136 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6679137 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6679138 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6679139 michael jordan is flattered and looking forward to meeting him
6679140 she made a deal with us that if three of her kids made the olympics at the same time that shed finally come
6679141 we are happy with our progress and we are excited about the growth during a cooler economy and during an election year i expect to continue to see increased growth over the coming months and years as more boomers and investors get closer to retirement look to truly diversify and shift a portion of their funds out of the market and into the local real estate market
6679142 it is always nice to be recognized in this way however our admissions officers always tell prospective students that they should select a college or university that best suits their needs not by its position in a ranking
6679143 we have worked and will continue to work very hard to enhance the academic experience for undergraduate students
6679144 one of the criticisms of the rankings is that they move very slowly it takes a long time for schools to improve
6679145 they may be doing things today that arent going to be reflected for five years in the rankings we wanted to find a way to illuminate some schools that are doing some really interesting thing
6679146 we are excited to have our new advisory board in place to advise us on phone and the channel partners conference amp expo
6679147 we had more than 70 qualified applicants apply for board positions and feel that we have selected a board that will add valuable insight to these resources and the channel
6679148 development is a lot of work when youre trying to improve on an ever changing process the load is much easier now with the two additions to the team to support myself while i support the design and seo teams

6679217 im really glad and excited to do it its something ive always wanted to do
6679218 being an athlete is an identity that is kind of all encompassing
6679219 it was a seamless transition to go from being a cyclist to a coach easier than something like going from being a cyclist to a lawyer
6679220 because every day it seems that you find a way by innuendo or any other means to put women down
6679221 i put down liberals if they happen to be women i put em down
6679222 rush limbaugh has been the leading political talk show host in america and talk radio has been one of the leading forces in american politics
6679223 limbaugh is to talk radio what elvis presley was to rock and roll presley was its biggest star but he was not its only star
6679224 i didnt hire rush limbaugh or put him on the air in new york to be a conservative talk show host
6679225 i brought him to be a talk show personality the fact that he was more conservative than liberal was not of interest to me other than the fact that i saw an opening there i realized if i was all liberal all day i was not reaching the vast total audience
6679226 limbaugh is just off the charts talented and after that there was a need for a real conservative and so conservatives rallied around him and liberals rallied to hate him
6679227 he is no longer just the populist mouthpiece he is not someone who takes talking points from the white house or newt gingrich
6679228 he is the center of gravity or at least close to it of conservatives but not the republican party
6679229 does he believe he has talent on loan from god no that was part of the shtick that he did
6679230 the part that he takes very seriously are his convictions about politics or about government or about society
6679231 i did have people who were sort of pseudo conservatives who last week would have been liberals who would have done anything that you wanted them to do on the air i was convinced when i met limbaugh and his brother that they were the real deal
6679232 limbaugh is to talk radio what elvis presley was to rock and roll presley was its biggest star but he was not its only star
6679233 it is promising that the clashes have reached an end a cease fire has been provided and russia has started to withdraw its troops in accordance with it

6679242 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
6679243 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
6679244 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection
6679245 the charges relate to the repeated sexual assault of a former altar boy on the states south coast

6679251 i have no information on poti i have to double check

6679253 first his troops are going to be out on monday then his troops were gonna be out on wednesday now his troops are gonna be out on friday
6679254 im beginning to wonder if the russian president is ever going to keep his word or can he keep his word or whats going on there
6679255 many people have died because of russias use of cluster munitions in georgia even as moscow denied it had used this barbaric weapon
6679256 how long has russian been occupying georgia we have to think about that
6679257 its an opportunity for them to show that they know how to do it
6679258 in this regard a bad choice hurts much more than a good choice helps
6679259 i think a week from tomorrow we will all know

6679302 will they not then ponder over this quran or are there locks upon their hearts
6679303 and lo satan made all their doings seem goodly to them and said
6679304 behold i am not responsible for you behold i see something that you do not see behold i fear allah for allah is severe in retribution
6679305 the like of what happens when satan says unto man
6679306 behold i am not responsible for thee behold i fear allah the sustainer of all the worlds
6679307 by means of intoxicants and games of chance satan seeks only to sow enmity and hatred among you and to turn you away from the remembrance of god and from prayer will you not then desist
6679308 and one day he entered the city at a time when most of its people were resting in their houses unaware of what was going on in the streets and there he encountered two men fighting with one another one of his own people and the other of his enemies
6679309 this is of satans doing verily he is an open foe leading man astray
6679310 o you who have attained to faith surrender yourselves wholly unto allah and follow not satans footsteps for verily he is your open foe
6679311 and of the cattle reared for work and for the sake of their flesh eat whatever allah has provided for you as sustenance and follow not satans foot steps behold he is your open foe
6679312 o my father do not worship satan for verily satan is a rebel against the most gracious
6679313 o my father i dread lest a chastisement from the most gracious befall thee and then thou wilt become aware of having been close unto satan
6679314 and yet among men there is many a one who argues about allah without having any knowledge of him and follows every rebellious satanic force
6679315 about which it has been decreed that whoever entrusts himself to it him will it lead astray and guide towards the suffering of the blazing flame
6679316 o you who have attained to faith follow not satans footsteps for he who follows satans foot steps will find that behold he enjoins but deeds of abomination and all that runs counter to reason and were it not for allahs favor upon you and his grace not one of you would ever have remained pure for thus it is allah who causes whomever he wills to grow in purity for allah is all hearing all knowing
6679317 did i not enjoin on you o you children of adam that you should not worship satan since verily he is your open foe
6679318 behold luqman said to his son by way of instruction

6679327 it all depends not on us but on those who make the decisions on what the priorities are for the leaders of nato in foreign policy

6679362 these findings shed light on why in listening environments such as noisy parties or restaurants it is more difficult to follow a conversation involving many people where the relevant talker often and unexpectedly changes locations than to focus on one talker at one location exclusively

6679613 the public deserves to know the hidden agenda behind this is to deceive them
6679614 taking advantage of the american peoples love for their pets hsus is able to deceive donors and the public into believing the organization is in the mainstream of american values
6679615 it is this mainstream image that allows hsus to raise its 100 million dollar budget to take our hunting and fishing rights away
6679616 some animal rights groups masquerade as pet shelters so donating to a local organization gives the contributor the opportunity to determine how their funds will actually be spent
6679617 nope and i dont want to live with you anymore either i want to live with devon

6679621 ser palha o ter a capacidade de descobrir o riso de partir na busca do inusitado vido por novos ares por diferentes pontes por mares e terras nunca vistos encontrar alegria onde todos antes s viam a desventura a afli o o sofrimento
6679622 ser palha o n o ter medo de bancar o bobo de perguntar o ainda n o inquirido de tocar em pontos na apar ncia fortes mas na ess ncia fr geis castelos de areia de caducas certezas possuir a habilidade de tro ar do esp rio do preconceito dos falsos doutos
6679623 ser palha o ser ciente de que a humildade companheira da alegria que no fundo de todos n s mora uma crian a que caso seja desperta passar a reinstalar seu reinado na face das cidades a cultivar roseiras de criatividade no colo cinza dos dias a ofertar auroras na casmurrice da rotina insana
6679624 we must thank god that our per capita income has increased from year to year in 2004 our per capita income stood at us 1 186 but it rose to us 1 946 in 2007 or an increase of 64 percent in the past three years
6679625 there arent too many authors of note who have passed through l a in the last three decades whom connie hasnt interviewed and interviewed well
6679626 this inherently transdisciplinary archive will provide material for research projects for generations of scholars and students
6679627 digitizing these tapes will give students and others an opportunity to hear and watch these outstanding authors for themselves whenever they want
6679628 seeing authors up close like this provides a rich point of view to their work
6679629 drucker believed that a healthy society is run by organizations whose values are shaped by a wide range of disciplines history sociology psychology culture and religion
6679630 in fact drucker once described management books as dreadful trash and suggested that he derived much of his philosophy from novelists such as austen balzac and others
6679631 is a beautiful setting for the tapes to call home
6679632 the idea that public companies should undergo periodic forensic audits designed to detect fraud failed to excite a panel of audit experts during a meeting of the public company accounting oversight boards standing advisory group most members of the panel seemed unconvinced that a companywide forensic audit would be cost effective or indeed effective at all
6679633 the idea that public companies should undergo periodic forensic audits designed to detect fraud failed to excite a panel of audit experts during a meeting of the public company accounting oversight boards standing advisory group most members of the panel seemed unconvinced that a companywide forensic audit would be cost effective or indeed effective at all

6679635 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6679636 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6679637 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
6679638 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
6679639 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
6679640 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
6679641 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
6679642 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
6679643 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
6679644 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
6679645 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
6679646 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
6679647 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
6679648 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
6679649 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
6679650 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
6679651 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
6679652 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
6679653 nanti tergantung kepada pemerintah daerah ke depan sejauh mana mampu menyerap anggaran yang telah kita siapkan saat ini bola sudah berada pemerintah daerah untuk bekerja cepat merealisasikan dana itu
6679654 as soon as the love relationship does not lead me to me as soon as i in a love relationship do not lead another person to himself this love even if it seems to be the most secure and ecstatic attachment i have ever experienced is not true love for real love is dedicated to continual becoming
6679655 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
6679656 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
6679657 schade dass ich keine medaille mit nach hause bringen kann ich habe ein super stechen gehabt ein zehntel ist sehr sehr wenig
6679658 das war sehr belastend aber ich habe versucht mich auf den sport zu konzentrieren
6679659 ich habe probiert mich damit nicht zu besch ftigen und auf meine leistung zu konzentrieren
6679660 ich bin mit einem knopf in der m hne h ngengeblieben und konnte mich nicht mehr richtig ausbalancieren
6679661 we need a senator who is going to start addressing the issues now republican christine odonnell charged in a telephone interview that was followed by a news conference in dover
6679662 hes using the people of delaware and this senate career as a fallback to his aspirations to another career the situation is too critical for that
6679663 in this election i should be debating my real competition for this job odonnell said
6679664 and the people of delaware should get the opportunity to cast a vote for the person who is going to fulfill their term hes taken delawareans for granted and using the senate as a placeholder
6679665 whether people agree with my positions or not they should be outraged she said
6679666 this is precisely why our country and our state is in the situation it is
6679667 mccain cant keep track and referred inquiring reporters to his staff
6679668 economic problems that will make this years financial turbulence look like a trip to the debt counselors office
6679669 this is about shifting the power back to the people
6679670 people got used to hearing something cool on a commercial and being like what band is this
6679671 if theyre out there really doing it if theyre playing at the echo then theyre not just being informed by how do i make this for a commercial theyre informed by their whole experience therefore you deliver something authentic
6679672 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
6679673 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
6679674 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
6679675 auster moves from the personal to the political august brill a retired book critic and widower lies in bed recovering from a car accident and conjures an alternate reality in which al gore won the 2000 election and sept 11 and the iraq war never happened instead theres a civil war its an intriguing idea and the brooklyn resident who is also a screenwriter translator and occasional song lyricist will read from the work at politics amp prose on thursday express man in the dark
6679676 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
6679677 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
6679678 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
6679679 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
6679680 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
6679681 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
6679682 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
6679683 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
6679684 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
6679685 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
6679686 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
6679687 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
6679688 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
6679689 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
6679690 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6679691 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
6679692 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if youre dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
6679693 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
6679694 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
6679695 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
6679696 the interpretation of publicly verifiable documents not a collection of unverifiable innuendoes and rumours
6679697 if youre challenging an incumbent or running for an open seat in competition with someone better known or more experienced than you the odds are that youre going to lose unless you have skillfully used opposition research
6679698 for a lot of people who have health insurance they are paying more for health care but it may not show up as concretely as paying 70 to fill their gas tank
6679699 college costs health care costs and energy costs are up and income is down
6679700 any one of those subjects touches a raw nerve for the middle class in this country im seeing it in race after race
6679701 the issue of health care may be getting less attention than it deserves from the media but its still a top concern for voters and among the top issues that sen obama talks about on the campaign trail
6679702 there is a stark contrast in the way both candidates would address the issue because the views on providing affordability accessibility and portability of health care are so divergent it could hardly escape the conversation each candidate will have with voters
6679703 if people had to pass that many signs that announced how much health care costs you can bet it would be at the top of the agenda
6679704 it is strikingly different from 2000 when gore spent 60 percent of the time at most events talking about health care
6679705 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
6679706 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
6679707 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
6679708 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
6679709 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
6679710 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
6679711 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
6679712 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
6679713 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
6679714 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
6679715 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
6679716 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
6679717 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
6679718 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
6679719 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
6679720 jerusalem must remain the capital of israel and must remain undivided
6679721 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
6679722 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
6679723 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
6679724 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
6679725 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
6679726 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
6679727 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
6679728 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
6679729 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
6679730 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
6679731 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
6679732 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
6679733 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
6679734 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
6679735 oh weve got more important things we have to do
6679736 attack cindy she owns the homes i thought he said the wives were off limits
6679737 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
6679738 people who live in glass houses ought not to throw stones dont ya think
6679739 since when did democrats care about how many houses people own
6679740 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
6679741 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
6679742 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
6679743 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
6679744 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
6679745 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
6679746 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
6679747 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
6679748 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
6679749 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
6679750 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
6679751 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
6679752 was f r ein kerl ist doch dieser kleist gewesen
6679753 die in m glichst einfacher menschlicher weise ber das leben und schaffen von kleist berichten
6679754 der das keusche und das sinnliche das geistige und das k rperliche der frau so einzigartig bindet wie unser heinrich von kleist
6679755 er lebte sang und litt in tr ber schwerer zeit er suchte hier den tod und fand unsterblichkeit
6679756 when its hard living on a 500 per month fixed income hard to pay the light bill pay for natural gas go to town and buy gasoline thats when it hits home
6679757 we know that here in south carolina we have a disparity in health care
6679758 we have to bring in communities that will be more affected make them part of the decision making
6679759 why do you need us to join the climate debate are you saying because i am black i am not involved already or that you need more useful victims for your cause agenda
6679760 it becomes evident that while discussing climate we are not witnessing a clash of views about the environment but a clash of views about human freedom
6679761 as someone who lived under communism for most of my life i feel obliged to say that the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity at the beginning of the 21st century is not communism or its various softer variants
6679762 why do so many people who subscribe to the belief in global warming also subscribe to the leftist liberal viewpoint on so many matters why does this belief appeal to those that have a certain political view
6679763 what does a cane toad and salt water intrusion have to do with global warming see you liberals just flip and spin flip and spin obama is an expert at it
6679764 it didnt take us long to figure out what this
6679765 if the lawyers will take the case sue the people who sell carbon credits that includes al gore that lawsuit would get so much publicity so much media attention and as the experts went to the witness stand and testified i feel like that could become the vehicle to finally put some light on the fraud of global warming
6679766 also i dont think that the republicans have handled the war on terror very well either
6679767 none of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed climate changes to increases in greenhouse gases
6679768 no study to date has positively attributed all or part of the climate change to man made causes
6679769 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6679770 quit categorizing everyone who is not a conservative republican as an athiest who has no love and respect for this nation
6679771 how can you be so self centered how can you seriously type this nonsense
6679772 btw going from the frying pan to the fire is technically
6679773 bowing to pressure from environmental groups the florida senate recently passed a bill backed by gov charlie crist that would eventually shut down six pipes that carry waste water into the atlantic from miami dade broward and palm beach counties
6679774 people are getting smart on the bs behind mmgw and that is exactly why algore is trying to recruit
6679775 no trippin we just have to stop dumping raw feces and piss into the ocean simple
6679776 i didnt know what to expect some kind of moonscape perhaps but it was incredible huge matrices of branching porites coral up to 8 meters 25 feet high had established creating a thriving coral reef habitat
6679777 throughout other parts of the lagoon it was awesome to see coral cover as high as 80 percent and large tree like branching coral formations with trunks 30 centimeters 12 inches thick
6679778 it seems like you won approval from all who write bs on every subject every day the know it alls stay true to yourself never change to please others or to fit in
6679779 oil prices are influenced by the us dollars retreat and diplomatic tensions between the us and russia
6679780 cpix for july should begin to reflect the steep rise in electricity prices as this will have been included in the survey
6679781 we expect that cpix will continue to rise until the new inflation basket is introduced in jan 2009
6679782 the household component of the credit number is particularly important as consumers try and smooth their consumption across the inflation cycle despite higher rates
6679783 we look for still robust growth there of 14 5 percent year on year
6679784 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
6679785 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
6679786 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
6679787 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
6679788 the 14 year old newcomer to the national team who was recruited last year has raised a lot of eyebrows recently after she broke two world records on the uneven bars in as many months
6679789 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
6679790 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
6679791 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
6679792 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
6679793 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
6679794 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
6679795 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
6679796 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
6679797 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
6679798 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
6679799 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
6679800 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
6679801 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
6679802 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
6679803 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
6679804 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
6679805 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
6679806 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
6679807 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
6679808 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
6679809 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
6679810 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
6679811 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
6679812 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
6679813 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
6679814 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
6679815 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
6679816 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
6679817 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
6679818 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
6679819 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
6679820 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
6679821 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
6679822 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
6679823 bei scheunenbrand in grevesm hlen menschen verletzt und pferde get tet
6679824 eu i ramona suntem simpli amici nu a existat nici o rela ie de alt natur ntre noi ne cunoa tem de la o prezentare de mod care a avut loc n urm cu c teva luni
6679825 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
6679826 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
6679827 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
6679828 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
6679829 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
6679830 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
6679831 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
6679832 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
6679833 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
6679834 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
6679835 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
6679836 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
6679837 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
6679838 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
6679839 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
6679840 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
6679841 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
6679842 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day

6679845 its a tough golf course i thought if you shoot in the red all week in the 60s all week youll have something at the end there
6679846 i thought the scores werent going to be as low
6679847 hunter had such a great round and there were some 4 or 5 under par rounds so my 1 under par round is not as good as i thought it would be but i thought i played well and ill take it
6679848 pela primeira vez vejo piso de tartan numa prova t nhamos que fazer o dobro da for a sem falar na umidade alta na temperatura o clima em pequim muito inst vel na primeira hora da prova estava frio na ltima muito quente

6679850 first we divide the amount of energy that the reactor produces 2 500 megawatts by the nameplate rating of the wind turbine which is 1
6679851 now let us look at the amount of land area that would be needed for these 6 668 wind turbines
6679852 to figure the spacing of the wind turbines let us multiply the rotor diameter of 77 meters by 3 which gives us 231 meters as the spacing between the wind turbines
6679853 if we multiply 231 by 385 it will give us the total area required to site one of our 1 5 mw wind turbines this comes out to 88 935 square meters or 22 acres of land for one 1 5 mw wind turbine if we now multiply the 22 acres by the 6 668 wind turbines we get 146 696 acres which is 229 21 square miles about three times the size of the metropolitan washington d c area so it appears that it will take 146 696 acres of land covered with wind turbines to have a part time generating capability equivalent to that achieved on 4 000 acres of land for the nuclear power plant which includes a lake used to provide water to the cooling towers
6679854 wind energy advocates purposely confuse the availability factor and the capacity factor in their promotional materials to try to demonstrate that a certain number of wind turbines can produce the same energy as a nuclear power plant in truth although the availability factor of the wind turbine is 100 because it is available to produce power at any time wind turbines actually produce power less than 25 of the time and that is only when the wind blows compare this to the nuclear power plant in which the availability factor and the capacity factor are the same about 95 the only time the nuclear reactor is not producing power is during maintenance periods

6679866 were really familiar we really understand each other even our personalities
6679867 ive had little contact with her since she went to singapore so i dont feel conflicted playing against her
6679868 i dont think her shots are that difficult to handle
6679869 i controlled the match overall she also played well but from the fifth game on she seemed to lose her calm
6679870 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
6679871 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
6679872 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
6679873 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
6679874 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
6679875 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
6679876 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
6679877 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
6679878 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
6679879 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
6679880 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
6679881 the claims about bullet voting in the dartmouth alumni election remind me that with a per voter average of voting for 1 8 candidates the proportion of bullet votes has to be fairly small the alternative as i mentioned in a communcation a day or two ago is that nearly everyone voted for one or three candidates but not two unlikely as that might be it would suggest that most of those who voted followed a strategy of either voting for the petition candidate or voting for all nominated candidates in which case richie s claim that the opposition was disorganized falls apart as does the claim by some of the alumni council people that in a 1 on 1 situation the petition candidate would been defeated
6679882 because approving a second choice may help defeat the voters first choice it is likely to devolve to typical vote for one plurality voting

6679911 my electrical meter should be standing still or going backwards
6679912 the system will offset their electrical bill by about 80 percent
6679913 it will stabilize their bill and shield them from the unknown of future edison rate increases
6679914 it will offset 537 000 miles driven by the average car
6679915 thats about eliminating 21 500 miles driven per year its like taking 1 7 cars off the road for 25 years and planting 2 8 acres of trees
6679916 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
6679917 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
6679918 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful

6679923 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance

6679937 i put down liberals if they happen to be women i put em down
6679938 rush limbaugh has been the leading political talk show host in america and talk radio has been one of the leading forces in american politics
6679939 limbaugh is to talk radio what elvis presley was to rock and roll presley was its biggest star but he was not its only star
6679940 i didnt hire rush limbaugh or put him on the air in new york to be a conservative talk show host
6679941 i brought him to be a talk show personality the fact that he was more conservative than liberal was not of interest to me other than the fact that i saw an opening there i realized if i was all liberal all day i was not reaching the vast total audience
6679942 limbaugh is just off the charts talented and after that there was a need for a real conservative and so conservatives rallied around him and liberals rallied to hate him
6679943 he is no longer just the populist mouthpiece he is not someone who takes talking points from the white house or newt gingrich
6679944 he is the center of gravity or at least close to it of conservatives but not the republican party
6679945 does he believe he has talent on loan from god no that was part of the shtick that he did
6679946 the part that he takes very seriously are his convictions about politics or about government or about society
6679947 i did have people who were sort of pseudo conservatives who last week would have been liberals who would have done anything that you wanted them to do on the air i was convinced when i met limbaugh and his brother that they were the real deal
6679948 limbaugh is to talk radio what elvis presley was to rock and roll presley was its biggest star but he was not its only star

6679978 listen the performance lately has been a little rougher than anyone would like to go through
6679979 but we didnt make any bones about what we were going to do when we said we were going to go through a rebuilding
6679980 for people who watch the team on a day to day basis that might seem like a long way away but our goal first and foremost was to rebuild our system and we have done that im very pleased by that very pleased when i see the young players we have in our system to go from where we were this time last year to where we are now is amazing
6679981 ive seen all of their minor league guys and believe me when i say this billy did a good thing
6679982 of all the organizations ive seen they have the best talent ive seen this year he has a plan
6679983 given the direction were going we thought it was the proper move at the time long term well benefit from it with the players we got
6679984 part of it is that we played so well before the break it seems like rebuilding happens overnight and it doesnt
6679985 last year we were in third place our payroll was growing beyond our means and we had no farm system now were in third place but have the system we wanted and our payroll has been reduced to the point that we have more flexibility to do some other things
6679986 were taking our licks right now but were going to come back next year and be unbelievable
6679987 when everyone here figures out what were doing we can pull off something like tampa bay has this year no one here should have their heads down
