3210000 weve just got to continue to work to achieve that i think guys have been working
3210001 i guess cleveland fans arent used to watching many notre dame games youve got too many ohio state fans up here but
3210002 ive always been able to make all the throws again the defense dictates what throws you make when youre in there
3210003 there was an incompletion on a third down throw to jerome harrison that probably could have been a little bit better of a ball
3210004 it looked like the defense was going to a certain coverage i was trying to read one side did one side didnt
3210005 that was one of the decisions probably where if i would have stuck with my gut instinct it would have maybe worked out better we would have converted and maybe kept the drive alive
3210006 theyre in that position for a reason i think you could see on braylons touchdown catch and some of the plays dont had theyre fun to throw to
3210007 thats something hopefully ill have the opportunity to work with maybe in this next game or in the near future
3210008 we were told thursday and i called and e mailed washington high athletic director tim ridgley that we were ok to go
3210009 for friday night its just going to be new turf

3210015 newsweek noted the curriculum of ledins courses were full of contempt for the antivirus software market and that he didnt hold his fire at the size of the industry
3210016 bnp has made a political error by not backing candidates in the local polls it was not a right decision by the party
3210017 it was not right to allow awami league their rival a walkover as a result the party lags behind at field level
3210018 we remain inactive as we do not want to split the party
3210019 there is no alternative to unity if bnp wants to participate in the national elections most of the leaders and workers of the party want unity
3210020 we believe that there will be no disunity if the leader is released
3210021 the government is going to free the leader as advisers have already said her release process is at the final stage there is no need to give any further deadline
3210022 bnp is a popular party which is always in favour of elections people want democracy they want elections that is why bnp should participate in all the elections
3210023 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime

3210026 we have decided to formalise our position to fifa and will be writing to them seeking a change of venue
3210027 the safety of the players and the fans must be our primary concern we will of course monitor the situation carefully but at this stage we cannot be assured of our safety in georgia
3210028 we will work with fifa uefa and the georgian fa to help in whatever way we can to make sure the game does not become a casualty of what is a very sad and difficult situation
3210029 we are discussing the final venue but it will be played in either baku in azerbaijan or abovyan in armenia
3210030 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3210031 the russian government must reverse the course that it appears to be on
3210032 gal hirsh and israel ziv are mainly training and consulting georgian arm units
3210033 to every israeli agent representing an israeli defense company is attached a cousin of the defense minister who opens the doors for him
3210034 the israeli military industries upgraded in recent years the georgian air force sold unmanned aerial vehicles uav advanced artillery systems and trained infantry units
3210035 the people of kashmir are not going to sit still at the death of a leader
3210036 the georgians are euphoric because they have been equipped trained that they have gained military experience in iraq it feeds this revanchist mood how can south ossetia be demilitarized when all of georgia is bristling with weaponry and its only an hours ride by tank from tbilisi to tskhinvali
3210037 civilian genocide dead americans cost of u s russia proxy war
3210038 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3210039 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3210040 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3210041 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3210042 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
3210043 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
3210044 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
3210045 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
3210046 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3210047 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3210048 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals
3210049 its been the behavior of the industry to allow steep discounting once we are in month therefore its encouraged everybody to delay booking
3210050 as we do a better job of firming our pricing and do a better job of selling value rather than just pricing to stimulate demand i think some of these things are going to naturally fall away
3210051 were seeing a reduction in rates across the board some of this is due to shorter length spots being sold and being priced accordingly and otherwise due to just a lack of demand on the national side
3210052 over the last decade the communications landscape has changed dramatically
3210053 we have seen tremendous growth in certain sectors including cable wireless and satellite services and the development of new technologies and ways of communicating during this same period other sectors such as the wireline industry have opened to competition and benefited from deregulation
3210054 through the further notice we will explore ways to ensure that all services pay their fair share of the costs of the commissions enforcement activities policy and rulemaking activities user information services and international activities
3210055 what could be more important than serving our community in the
3210056 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people
3210057 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on
3210058 we are dealing with a large number of wounded and dead
3210059 cambio total de gabinete y formaci n de un gobierno de coalici n
3210060 hay que hacer campa a por el s para que se queden todos
3210061 primero que han sido elegidos por un per odo determinado y deben cumplirlo de otro modo no podremos evaluar su gesti n adecuadamente segundo que si los sacamos ahora tendr n siempre el pretexto de que no los dejamos completar su obra y culpar n de todo lo malo que hicieron a la oposici n tercero que dejar n papas calientes a los que vengan y aprovechar n eso para transferirles la responsabilidad y salvarse de la furia popular con el referendum revocatorio ellos ganan y nosotros perdemos
3210062 todo depende de los plazos en que pongas tu mirada me dijo no te das cuenta en el corto plazo tal vez nos convenga que se vayan todos porque nunca hemos perdido tantas oportunidades en tan poco tiempo como en esta poca pero en el largo plazo nos conviene que el pueblo mida la verdadera capacidad o incapacidad de estos l deres y no se queden con dudas que les permitan traerlos de nuevo
3210063 claro me dijo lo vas a tener que pensar y mientras tanto los que act an habr n avanzado algunos pasos m s en la insensatez que los gu a

3210082 the truth is i spent a lot of my childhood singing when the other kids were outside playing football and getting into trouble
3210083 with the coming change in administration putting the station on a more powerful signal was the logical next step in the evolution of federal news radio which serves the ever growing and important federal community
3210084 weve fought like hell for a year and theyve finally listened to us this proposal obviously suits us down to the ground
3210085 its their strength of mind their ability to fight for their very existence
3210086 hutt have indicated that they want to help assist this and im really grateful that theyve done that
3210087 we are very pleased with the significant strategic progress made thus far in 2008 despite the fact that as we have previously discussed our financial results do not yet reflect the pieces being put in place that should return imax to profitability importantly the execution of our digital roll out launched on time our future film slate is strong and growing our pipeline of new business remains robust we have the largest systems backlog in our history reflecting our joint revenue sharing strategy and we believe we have the necessary financing in place to fund our joint venture initiative looking ahead we believe the combination of having approximately 50 digital systems in operation by year end and the strength of our second half film slate led by the dark knight the imax experience should drive improved second half financial performance we continue to expect profitability in 2009
3210088 the launch of our digital technology and 100 theatre joint revenue sharing arrangement with amc are important strategic milestones for imax and represent the first steps toward what we expect to be a period of significant future growth for our organization the advent of imax digital virtually eliminates high film print costs incurred by the studios and lowers installation costs for exhibitors allowing for greater programming flexibility in addition with digital we will have the ability to show 10 to 12 major studio releases per year as opposed to six to eight historically which should translate into higher revenue and greater per theatre profitability
3210089 our joint revenue sharing business model makes it more affordable for exhibitors to be in the imax business while driving greater recurring revenue into our business this model coupled with our digital platform should enable us to rapidly increase the size of our worldwide network the installation of our commercial system backlog will roughly triple the number of imax theatres in domestic multiplexes and more than double the size of our commercial international network by 2010
3210090 the companys second quarter results reflect investments made to transition the company to a digital platform two fewer system installations for which we could recognize revenue as well as difficult year over year comparisons to last years highly successful spider man 3 the imax experience we believe the dark knight the imax experience combined with strength of our second half film slate should offset much of the softness of our year to date imax dmr film performance
3210091 the dark knight appears to be nothing short of a cultural phenomenon and we are delighted to be a part of it
3210092 in addition to a record opening weekend and continued sell outs the film is demonstrating extraordinary legs and very modest week to week drops in box office results the popularity of the film particularly in the imax format has tested our capacity constraints and we believe is heightening consumer interest in the imax experience
3210093 as we significantly increase the number of joint revenue sharing deals we sign the film choices we make will have a greater impact on our future financial performance as we will receive a greater percentage of the box office we believe the prospective films for 2009 are the type of blockbuster content that plays well to the imax experience and should make for an exciting film slate we are experiencing unprecedented interest from studios and filmmakers in featuring major hollywood releases in imax and we are pleased to be expanding our studio relationships we believe the imax brand is becoming synonymous with event type movie going that is compelling to movie goers theatre exhibitors and the studios and we look forward to announcing additional films in the coming weeks and months
3210094 through the program teams of young professionals from two different countries exchange visits for four to six weeks and will experience the way of life customs and vocational practices of another country while sharing information about their homeland
3210095 i think theyre too expensive last year i paid 1 921 24 and this year it will be 1 972 29 and although its only gone up by 50 bucks i know there are other places where the rates seem to be a lot cheaper
3210096 its not as if we are over run with services here so i have to ask why are we so expensive compared to other places
3210097 i dont think were getting value for money especially considering the street i live in hasnt been re sheeted or received road maintenance for quite some time
3210098 ive been in business here for 29 years and the cost was about 50 cents a litre when i started but the price now has become a burden on everyone in the transport and farming industries
3210099 it does make it very hard we end up with less of a profit and have to look at how to cut corners so itll ultimately cost the consumer a lot more further down the line
3210100 historically diesel has been cheaper than motor spirit petrol it was cheaper as it was a small market going back 30 years and the oil industry kept the price competitive to grow the market
3210101 that has turned around in the last few years as the demand has hit unprecedented levels due to the industrial growth from china and india and also because it is just as costly to refine the sulphur out of diesel as it is to refine petrol
3210102 but right now the price of diesel is dropping almost daily due to a slowing world economy particularly from china
3210103 the diesel used during winter is a different product than that of summer because regular diesel has a wax content which freezes so the only way to prevent that from happening is by refining the wax out
3210104 my kids are involved in sport and when i was elected i put up my hand to chair the recreational facilities committee where i managed to raise money from the state snowy hydro and council and spend over 200 000 on the netball courts kiosk and car park
3210105 the review of the swimming pool and getting three quarters of a million from the state and federal governments which will see a brand new amenities block built which will open at the beginning of the 2009 10 season is another personal achievement
3210106 our troops received the second highest and highest rating for their dancing which is exciting considering we were competing against larger canberra and sydney based schools
3210107 the students performance has given them a very good reputation and has put cooma a small country town on the map
3210108 will produce anywhere between 25 000 and 30 000 barrels of oil a day
3210109 right now its costing us approximately 1 million a day for us to operate the rig on this well
3210110 it does a visual inspection of our riser system and it ensures there are no leaks and were not polluting anything in the environment
3210111 its just like youre watching on a tv in the house
3210112 we have a tremendous amount of competition but at the same time we also have a high level of partnerships with the very same companies that were competing with because it takes tremendous amount of capital resource to be able to develop these things
3210113 as we continue to explore and find and develop these resources and as more oil comes onstream that will help lessen our dependency on foreign oil
3210114 somebody made that decision to not feed that child and my daughter had to follow instructions
3210115 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3210116 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3210117 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3210118 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3210119 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
3210120 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3210121 russia made clear the goal of this operation is the regime change in georgia change of democratically elected government
3210122 it is quite clear what is happening we are in the process of an invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3210123 pre planned cold blooded meditated murder of a small country
3210124 what else can happen for the world to wake up and see whats at stake
3210125 its disappointing it sends the wrong message to young girls shes in a position of influence being married to a public figure whether one likes it or not theres a degree of responsibility that goes with it

3210152 incorporate a domestic gas phase as part of our foundation project
3210153 under our state agreement with the wa government we were initially planning to submit a proposal for development of a 300 tj per day domestic gas plant by 31 december 2010 but we now plan to accelerate this to coincide with our development proposals to government for the lng phase
3210154 that means when we consider fid final investment decision we will consider fid for both lng and domestic gas with the domestic gas plant ready for start up to coincide at or around the commissioning of the projects third lng train
3210155 bringing on gorgons domestic gas phase earlier will increase the number of supply points for domestic gas into wa and has been welcomed by the state government

3210158 the mixtape format is increasingly popular as a way of generating hype for hip hop artists hip hop mixtapes are usually sold on the street or through independent record dealers or mail order mainly relying on word of mouth to increase the artists street credibility an unsigned artist might release several mixtapes to generate buzz leading to interest from record labels while a signed artist may release a mixtape to promote a future studio album

3210219 brodie broke the large radius bone just above the wrist in his right arm on saturday
3210220 he had a plate put in there to stabilise the affected area on monday and he will miss the remainder of the season
3210221 brodie had worked hard to overcome his achilles injury and to have this happen at this time of year after battling through his rehabilitation for a long time is shocking luck
3210222 players argue when we win too and its only usually highlighted when you lose
3210223 i suppose the tradition at this club is you demand a lot from each other and i know over the years when we won premiership after premiership wed argue with each other and demand a lot from each other and try to keep the standard up
3210224 its easy to kick a dog when its down and thats probably what andrew is probably doing
3210225 he has got enormous courage but he has got a lot of things he is coping with
3210226 anyone who goes to training knows he cant get out there and train on wednesdays
3210227 just playing weekends and then worrying about getting up the following week makes it tough to play at the level you are capable of playing of
3210228 even last year when he played all the games and he will play most games this year he is rarely able to train on a wednesday and his body does take a pounding
3210229 nigel hasnt been able to complete a normal training session since he hurt himself four months ago
3210230 time is marching on and we are now in the middle of august
3210231 if nigel completed a normal training session on wednesday he could return to the side but realistically he is no better placed than he was four months ago
3210232 he has done everything known to mankind in between but his achilles tendon is still sore when he runs
3210233 this is well deserved recognition for the development in shauns game particularly this season
3210234 he has provided pace and some of his work around the stoppages on saturday was very good
3210235 the continued development of our young players is important for our progress and shaun is one of the young players who is setting a great example in the manner in which he approaches his game
3210236 madonna now reckons itll go ahead during a three day break in the tour towards the end of the month not next weekend guy wants it to be traditional and british he has already ordered crate loads of real ales hes also arranged for a folk band to play and the people invited are all pretty old school gwyneth paltrow stella mccartney and trudie styler basically friends madonnas known for years everyone else will be immediate friends and family plus a few people from malawi that madonna will be flying out
3210237 plans are very hush hush but madonna is definitely going to celebrate her milestone in style unfortunately not everything has gone as expected as shes had many other things on her mind not least rehearsals for her sticky and sweet tour on top of all the stress of this she twisted her ankle over the weekend she views this as a sign that perhaps she should postpone the formal birthday bash and play it by ear instead madonna now reckons itll go ahead during a three day break in the tour towards the end of the month not next weekend
3210238 the people here are nervous because they cant get out of georgia the overall felling is that battles may erupt in tbilisis streets at any moment you can here the russian jest flying overhear it is very unnerving

3210243 theres a greater incidence of obesity among children in our district
3210244 we often think of sports and physical education of a highly competitive variety but this is a more rounded approach where there are roles for everyone
3210245 there are other roles with sports that come with movement for example being a referee so teaching kids the rules of particular sport
3210246 we get our captain back next week so that is huge improvement for us and hamish mcintosh we will probably just about bring him straight back in
3210247 he has been training really well and he can play second fiddle to drew petrie and david hale

3210251 bila kamu meminta maka mintalah kepada allah dan bila kamu memohon pertolongan maka mohonlah pertolongan kepada allah
3210252 jika allah menimpakan kemudharatan kepadamu maka tidak ada yang menghilangkannya melainkan dia sendiri

3210260 in case any bad guys try to get in our room
3210261 we in russia we cannot see how we can do business with him
3210262 the immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces to their positions prior to august 7
3210263 the sovereignty independence and territorial integrity of georgia within its internationally recognized borders
3210264 to take further action as appropriate to help bring about and implement a peaceful and durable solution to the crisis
3210265 the russian army is trying to enforce peace and to do so we have to attack georgian military targets
3210266 we have not received a clear answer today to that question
3210267 why start a second front from abkhazia why attack the rest of georgia and why attack the infrastructure of georgia why threaten to attack the civilian airport of tbilisi
3210268 stop 0000021a the windows logon process system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0x00000135 the system has been shut down

3210274 different people will have different views of priority but we do know as we walk around the community people are concerned generally about the issue of health and how this government hasnt managed health properly
3210275 if we look at the workplace and job security really industrial relations is such an anachronism that belongs in the 19th century
3210276 people today are concerned about participation and good relationships in the workplace and its about job security and thats what we want reflected in our portfolio
3210277 stop 0000021a the windows logon process system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0x00000135 the system has been shut down

3210282 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3210283 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3210284 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3210285 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3210286 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3210287 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3210288 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3210289 whether its a death sentence or a life sentence at the moment we are glad that there has been a resolution
3210290 i hope that the appeal process will be a lot quicker than the trial process
3210291 given the past track record of this matter it could be years before the appeal is heard or resolved
3210292 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3210293 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3210294 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3210295 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3210296 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3210297 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3210298 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3210299 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3210300 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3210301 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3210302 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3210303 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3210304 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3210305 you can induce the test mode drain the device battery and turn off therapies
3210306 this is something that academics can do now we have to do something before the ability to mount attacks becomes easier
3210307 collaborative academic effort where medical device security researchers have figured
3210308 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
3210309 we are dealing with a large number of wounded and dead
3210310 wouldnt this be crazy mom if i went potty in the little trash can in the laundry room
3210311 yes audrey that would be crazy please dont do that ever
3210312 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3210313 auspicious development that has paved the way for full scale negotiations raising the prospect for an all inclusive government
3210314 it is regrettable that our detractors continue to impose more sanctions
3210315 we therefore call on britain and its allies to remove sanctions to enable us to freely chart our destinies
3210316 his family have a very strong support unit but all of them are just incredibly shocked
3210317 and just really really looking to find out more so that way we can begin planning to celebrate lees life in the correct way

3210319 he ran regularly it was part of his training for football
3210320 shes got a good family and friends supporting her but obviously shes very much in shock
3210321 i believe they were just about to move in together
3210322 he would have a drink occasionally at a party but i should imagine that if he was doing something like a run he would have stayed in with michelle the night before
3210323 its just a terrible shame he was a wonderful individual who is going to be greatly missed
3210324 he was such a fantastic amazing caring fun loving person
3210325 he made everyone laugh and lived his life to the full he was living his dream in oz and seemed so in love with his girlfriend its devastating that he has been taken from us

3210341 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3210342 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3210343 we are working with an international community but all we got so far are just words statements moral support humanitarian aid
3210344 but we need more we want them to stop this barbaric aggressor
3210345 this appears to be a full invasion of georgia with an end result uncertain and an objective that is not clear but appears to be aggressive in nature
3210346 words like invasion should not be used lightly but this is an invasion
3210347 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3210348 this insensible totalitarian masista incapable government negates the development of the people and only seeks to concentrate power and convert us into its pawns
3210349 we are going to continue doing battle legally against the recall referendum because someone has to be at the head of the defense of democracy and bolivian citizens rights and obligations and that someone is me

3210352 obama wins demo nomination a black flag for white america
3210353 will be a clear signal for millions of our people
3210354 obama is a visual aid for white americans who just dont get it yet that we have lost control of our country and unless we get it back we are heading for complete annihilation as a people
3210355 it doesnt really matter if obama wins the election or mccain wins the election
3210356 neither of them are going to try to fight to preserve the white race or heritage
3210357 those were the good old days for straight white males but for everyone else it was a pretty raw deal
3210358 the revolution if you will in 1776 brought the 13 colonies together against the king and the same thing can happen now against martin luther king with the 50 states
3210359 see richard doesnt really mean what he says its popular for him to say it thats the way he makes a living
3210360 same as jesse jackson some more of our black revolutionaries who make a living off of keeping things emotional
3210361 i dont think the majority of white people are thinking that way anymore
3210362 im concerned that once he gets in office that he wont be recognized as an american president
3210363 we are made up of people of every conceivable racial background

3210405 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
3210406 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
3210407 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
3210408 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts

3210434 jerusalem has a strong interest in having caspian oil and gas pipelines reach the turkish terminal port of ceyhan rather than the russian network intense negotiations are afoot between israel turkey georgia turkmenistan and azarbaijan for pipelines to reach turkey and thence to israel s oil terminal at ashkelon and on to its red sea port of eilat from there supertankers can carry the gas and oil to the far east through the indian ocean
3210435 man we really set ourselves up in a way that was bound to create problems and produce schisms we were bound to follow programs without thinking
3210436 how the heck are you going to hook up with that
3210437 lets see what we can learn from the panther experience and build upon and improve it we cant do things the same way
3210438 thats fine if you dont want to hear it but we want the young folks to hear it so they know about some of the things that did not work in the panthers so they know that we had some internal contradictions that we could not overcome
3210439 here is the picture if you read this you will automatically follow our organization and join the revolution
3210440 wait maybe we dont need to organize like that wait the way that you are treating people within the organization is oppressive wait what is your vision would you like to hear mine
3210441 if you were taking tdqm for a night out what three things would we all do
3210442 so you have kids a husband a career oh dont worry it will happen soon enough
3210443 and we do it to ourselves i do it to myself
3210444 god created the heaven and the earth and the earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep
3210445 what in heck does he think hes doing how far does he intend to go and does he expect me to help him take care of all this crazy stuff
3210446 people want me to come to their house at all hours of the night
3210447 i look at it and im glad i can make a difference
3210448 since i took that stroke over that gang graffiti its been kind of like the godfather
3210449 i keep trying to get out but they keep pulling me back in now i cant escape it
3210450 i saw him using myspace and facebook he just always had some clicking in his hand
3210451 i thought the kids are all getting into that i told him he needed to put together a myspace for me
3210452 everyone looks at myspace as something raunchy where people are just looking for girls or hooking up but i am just amazed at the information i get
3210453 people say thats a shame somebody should do something about it then it always goes away i had to decide on my own to do some things they talk about somebody should do something about it and i did
3210454 the fact that im unconventional and im an activist and a person thats out there a lot of people are uneasy with me they think im too flashy or just want to be on tv they want to attribute negative things to me but ive never done drugs i dont smoke ive not ever been in jail
3210455 they see me on tv and they remember me his hair is shiny and he wears sunglasses but they give me information
3210456 i did a campaign that was snitch to get rich
3210457 you have all these rappers promoting materialism so i said i would turn the information in from tips and you will get the reward i dont want the reward
3210458 i have also tried to pull stop snitching shirts off the shelves some of the people think its cool to snitch others dont but i ask them if someone raped your mother would you want people to be cool and not snitch
3210459 if you tolerate crime that crime will visit you eventually
3210460 other services and other events are planned this week including a tribute to all the victims planned friday at the jackson county fairgrounds in oregon
3210461 the sponsor of that bill then house chairman richard pombo r calif told the ap monday that allowing agencies to judge for themselves the effects of a project will not harm species or habitat
3210462 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3210463 the changes were needed to ensure that the endangered species act would not be used as a
3210464 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3210465 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3210466 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3210467 nay nay i cant believe it that you are nice
3210468 performa morgan dalam beberapa tahun ini menunjukan kontrol resiko tak bekerja
3210469 any type of vigorous exercise will likely do the trick
3210470 both common sense and background science support the idea that there is nothing magical about running per se
3210471 it is the regular physical vigorous activity that is important
3210472 the republican party is a dead rotting carcass with a few decrepit old leaders stumbling around like zombies in a horror version of weekend with bernie handcuffed to a corpse
3210473 are you nuts do not sleep in central park walk south on blank street and get to times square where you can catch the 7 subway to brooklyn
3210474 i was talking with him gerrard this morning and he will go with us to belgium
3210475 he is progressing really well but we will check after training
3210476 i will speak with the doctor and with steven and then decide
3210477 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect
3210478 they have not played in the group stages of the champions league before so they will be keen to change that also they will have the confidence of champions after winning their title
3210479 liverpool is a massive club and were expected to beat teams so im looking forward to the challenge
3210480 i certainly am ready ask any player and theyll tell you that pre season is just about getting fitness now the real business starts
3210481 whenever liverpool were playing in the champions league or in a game which had no effect on tottenham id be cheering them on the champions league is part of why i wanted to come here this is my opportunity now
3210482 love is the strongest emotion any creature can feel except for hate but hate cant hurt you love and trust and friendship and all the other emotions humans value so much are the only emotions that can bring pain only love can break a heart into so many pieces
3210483 as the apple tree among the trees of the wood so is my beloved among the sons
3210484 i feel strongly against it this part of town has enough crime and now were going to give them a wooded area to lurk in where our kids play
3210485 with all the green space columbia has why do they have to build a trail in peoples backyard
3210486 it wouldnt be so bad if we had known before we moved in so we could have chosen whether or not to buy
3210487 hard all weather pavement surfaces are usually preferred over those of crushed aggregate since these materials provide a much lower level of service and require higher maintenance
3210488 in areas that are subjected to frequent or even occasional flooding or drainage problems or in areas of steep terrain unpaved surfaces will often erode and are not recommended
3210489 what we find most difficult is gravel is prone to washing during flood conditions
3210490 if we go asphalt instead of concrete it cracks because of the drying out of clay underneath
3210491 weve gotten the most longevity out of concrete for this area because of the high clay content
3210492 we couldnt even get the permits to build a trail like that now
3210493 with all the federal regulations it would be very difficult and destructive to the environment to build
3210494 a few projects have preliminary designs but those have not been approved and could still change at this point
3210495 stop worrying so much about growing old worry about growing up
3210496 the greatest test of courage on earth is to bear defeat without losing heart
3210497 we have to wrap up the question of qualification to the group stage at home
3210498 artmedia are a team that score a lot but we are solid at the back and im not worried
3210499 at manchester we again showed we are reliable in defence
3210500 the u s military instructors directly command and coordinate actions of mercenaries without being involved in actual fighting the source specified according to intelligence data there are roughly 1 000 military instructors of the united states in georgia
3210501 task force of russia has annihilated a few groups of mercenaries some of mercenaries have been captured and investigators are working with them the source said
3210502 we have detained 10 agents of the georgian special services who were spying on military facilities and preparing terrorist attacks including on russian territory
3210503 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3210504 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america

3210518 it is no surprise this is happening as returns on land are generally equal to or higher than returns on bricks and mortar and come with a much lower entry level price indeed land prices in natal are forecast to go up by 15 25 per annum based on current market trends
3210519 there is plenty of cheap land available in brazil some in the middle of nowhere that is being marketed as a good investment several of these plots are classed as rustic land not buildable at present and consequently do not have utilities power and water and infrastructure roads
3210520 purchases in such land should be considered as high risk and purely speculative on the basis that one day they might get urbanised and the promoter might actually implement the infrastructure required
3210521 which is why the land is marketed cheaply by european standards even with the very healthy margins build into the sales price
3210522 the location of plots and property is critical to maximising the investment potential
3210523 infrastructure services such as power and water have already been installed and the roads will be complete within the next three six months

3210525 in the current case ivins complained privately that fbi agents had offered his son andy 2
3210526 duley had numerous meetings withthe fbi in the past month mcfadden said but he declined to provide specific information about those meetings
3210527 she sacrificed all this stuff because she wanted to do the right thing
3210528 that would link this strain of anthrax to dr ivins lab
3210529 using new genome technology researchers looked at samples of cells from the victims to identify the kind of anthrax ames strain that killed them the scientist said they noticed very subtle differences in the dna of the strain used in the attacks than in other types of ames anthrax
3210530 the science is known as dna fingerprinting although any two samples of anthrax bacteria will likely share roughly the same dna structure there are tiny differences from sample to sample
3210531 the new genome technology that tracked down ivins was either not available or too expensive to use often until about three years ago
3210532 the dna sequence of the anthrax sent through the us mail in 2001 has been revealed and confirms suspicions that the bacteria originally came from a us military laboratory
3210533 tatkala perbuatan liwath itu sangat berbahaya maka hukuman pelakunya di dunia dan akhirat pun sangat berat para ulama berselisih apakah hukuman pelaku homo itu lebib berat dari perbuatan zina ataukah hukuman zina itu lebih berat ataukah sama antara keduanya

3210541 as barack obama has said this is not our convention this is americas convention
3210542 and now at a critical moment in our history americans will have their concerns addressed challenges listened to and their questions answered live by our countrys leaders we want americans to be at the center of this convention and americas town hall will allow us to do just that
3210543 in the beginning the church was a fellowship of men and women centering on the living christ then the church moved to greece where it became a philosophy then it moved to rome where it became an institution next it moved to europe where it became a culture and finally it moved to america where it became an enterprise
3210544 dear boy what do we know of the idea of the divine and what can our narrow conceptions presume to tell of the supreme being if i called him by a hundred names like a turk i should yet fall short and have said nothing in comparison to the boundlessness of his attributes
3210545 the problems of the world cannot possibly be solved by skeptics or cynics whose horizons are limited by the obvious realities we need men who can dream of things that never were
3210546 focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition it asks too little of yourself because its only when you hitch your wagon to something larger than yourself that you realize your true potential
3210547 i count him braver who overcomes his desires than him who overcomes his enemies
3210548 millions of americans are facing tough challenges every day from the economy to the war in iraq to the housing crisis to crippling energy costs everywhere you go across this country people are calling for change they know we cant afford four more years of the same old divisive politics that are light on policy specifics and ways to help people and heavy on cynicism and negativity the politics and policies that have divided us will not allow us to achieve the change we need the 2008 convention is about ensuring that those peoples voices are heard and their call for change is heeded
3210549 from monday through thursday our convention program will highlight the people of this country who want positive change and who believe barack obama is the leader who will listen to their concerns and get our country moving in the right direction again
3210550 oh by the way your apartment will be unlocked door open and unsupervised all day
3210551 one gold last year may be enough for other countries but not mine
3210552 when they were both about to leave they had a heated argument outside the restaurant they were doing a good amount of yelling
3210553 i know youve never done this before with a student as young as me or any student really but i want you to be my first

3210563 didnt you find that unethical did you berate your brother
3210564 it never occurred to me im sorry for that i should have done that
3210565 i said i was surprised that the decision came up and i said well its beyond me
3210566 i really should have done that i did not want to create another problem but i was convinced of the urgency of the tro
3210567 it created more problems it now involved three retired justices we should be resting already
3210568 that bribery attempt was a criminal act and anything that seeks to unfairly influence the case directly affect the ponente and the decision
3210569 we cannot be indifferent to the brutality of these attacks

3210572 astounding in 2004 and 2005 big oil companies also received tax breaks worth over 17 billion over the next decade including avoiding at least another 7 billion to 9 billion in royalties owed to the u s government for oil and gas extracted from federal areas in the gulf of mexico
3210573 astounding in 2004 and 2005 big oil companies also received tax breaks worth over 17 billion over the next decade including avoiding at least another 7 billion to 9 billion in royalties owed to the u s government for oil and gas extracted from federal areas in the gulf of mexico
3210574 we cannot be indifferent to the brutality of these attacks
3210575 we send our condolences to dennis cuestas family and colleagues we call on local and national authorities to be vigorous in their investigations and move quickly to protect witnesses of both of these very public atrocities effective prosecution of the murderers is the only way to break the pattern of journalists being slain with impunity
3210576 both journalists were known for analysis of local political issues at their respective stations which are affiliated under the umbrella of the manila based media group radio mindanao network the killers in each case rode motorcycles a common characteristic of journalist shootings in the philippines and carried out the attacks in broad daylight
3210577 russian forces came to the central route and cut off connections between western and eastern georgia
3210578 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3210579 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3210580 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3210581 virtually all production has been shut down because of this
3210582 russian forces have destroyed senaki military base and have left it
3210583 pre planned cold blooded and pre meditated murder of a small country
3210584 no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3210585 there is an immediate and pressing need to end the fighting and disengage all military forces in south ossetia the georgian government has offered a ceasefire which i urge the russians to reciprocate without delay
3210586 all that we have had from the international community is humanitarian aid which is starting to arrive and statements re georgia fighting rages in s ossetia russian tanks head for battle
3210587 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3210588 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3210589 it is expected that supplies distributed by the us embassy in tbilisi will be exhausted by the end of the day
3210590 releasing 250 000 dollars in initial funding that can provide emergency relief supplies that can assist up to 10 000 people
3210591 russian and georgian forces must immediately cease hostilities throughout georgia and return to their august 6 positions
3210592 furthermore in escalating the conflict through its attacks on georgian towns and cities outside south ossetia russia has ceased to act as a peacekeeper it is imperative that russia respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia
3210593 military force will not resolve this dispute the only viable long term solution is international mediation and peacekeeping
3210594 we understand that we may face a massive money withdrawal so it seems logical to keep the assets in the banks
3210595 but we havent seen any kind of panic so far
3210596 much of the foreign money is invested in the infrastructure road railway and pipeline construction so it will be hard to withdraw
3210597 we try to export our wine and fruit to europe and the united states but they have very high standards so we would prefer russia
3210598 the situation in georgia highlights the greatly increased risks related to energy transits through the country
3210599 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3210600 the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward solving this conflict
3210601 raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region
3210602 these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3210603 its time for russia to be true to its word to act to end this crisis
3210604 what were calling on is for russia to stop its aggression
3210605 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
3210606 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
3210607 the russians have crossed the border and are now in control of zugdidi
3210608 we saw russian military trucks passing by we saw hundreds of soldiers there was a mix of soldiers from the regular army and soldiers that are supposed to be peacekeepers
3210609 is absolutely a war between russia and america the biggest mistake was in underestimating us now youll see what happens
3210610 the whole of south ossetia is in ruins the role of those who came here today is 100 per cent humanitarian they came to rebuild infrastructure
3210611 in the past two days about 2 000 people volunteered these are men with experience of military operations in hot spots
3210612 not one newspaper in the west has written the truth about whats happening here no one has written that the georgians were the ones who started this that they are the ones shooting women and children
3210613 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3210614 moved with care not to worsen relations with the us
3210615 the navy was ordered not to allow supplies of weapons and military hardware into georgia by sea
3210616 a blockade of the coast would mean that we were at war with georgia which we are not
3210617 the actions by the ukrainian side are contrary to ukrainian russian agreements and are hostile to the russian federation
3210618 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3210619 no one needs cold war with russia but this country has intruded into the territory of a sovereign state i was surprised at bushs embracing putin in the opening of the olympic games after that putin was sitting while bush and first lady were applauding the american team
3210620 putins next target will be ukraine but he can not do it there georgia has 5 million population and ukraine 50 million there are other factors too
3210621 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3210622 no one needs cold war with russia but this country has intruded into the territory of a sovereign state i was surprised at bushs embracing putin in the opening of the olympic games after that putin was sitting while bush and first lady were applauding the american team
3210623 putins next target will be ukraine but he can not do it there georgia has 5 million population and ukraine 50 million there are other factors too
3210624 today its georgia tomorrow its ukraine the day after tomorrow its latvia
3210625 russias aggression against georgia must be stopped with the help of coordinated actions of the international community immediately before all georgian infrastructure and economy is destroyed which would bring about humanitarian catastrophe with long term consequences in the entire region
3210626 justification of russias actions in georgia by the need to protect its citizens is unacceptable alleged reasons for taking up a war against georgia raise concerns about the future in every state with russian citizens living on its territory
3210627 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3210628 this has been a defining moment in russias relations with the rest of world
3210629 then said he unto them he that hath no sword let him sell his garment and buy one
3210630 the destiny of russia is reflected in the caucasus like the rays of the sun are reflected in a drop of water
3210631 in their statement they accused russia of no less than pursuing an imperial revisionist policy i leave it with you to judge about the quality and timeliness of the statement but i want to say that they found probably the most cynical and ill timed forms to express such an odd and absolutely illogical approach it was precisely because of such signals that the developments in south ossetia started on august 7
3210632 the people who are making irresponsible criminal decisions should always be clearly and definitely rebuffed by the intentional community
3210633 everyone should realize who released the flywheel of bloodshed and who is trying to stop it and restore normal life in this part of the caucasus
3210634 this is my city i will never leave it even if the russians come here and kill me why should i go to tbilisi and wait for them there

3210790 well no one made god hes outside time beyond time
3210791 the things we cant explain seem to be the things that are irrefutable or true
3210792 however if the whole idea of truth as matt and steve said is being called into question because many of the things we call true are based on things we cant explain is there even a way to answer those questions to provide the missing center since the function that governs the relevancy of those explanations in itself requires the same analysis

3210794 maternity leave is hard to come by in the united states so too are families with the wherewithal or the professional leeway to have one parent take off from work for months at a stretch hence the arrival of a new trend companies who allow new mothers to bring their babies to work

3210805 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3210806 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3210807 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

3210846 support for device management in mobile handsets 2007 c2009 4q07 update
3210847 it is crucial for service providers to understand the penetration of key enabling technologies in order to decide whether and when they should be scaling up the use of mdm in their businesses what is clear is that we are now at a critical point in terms of adoption of this key technology service providers looking to offer device management services based on oma dm should find they have a good choice of handsets across a range of price points
3210848 firmware updating is by no means the only application of oma dm that service providers are interested in oma dm is already being used for more sophisticated types of device configuration than oma cp is capable of such as continuous provisioning in conjunction with automatic detection it is handling client provisioning for new value added services being offered by operators and supporting important commercial functionality such as preferred roaming lists

3210885 the one guys loyalty and passion over there i dont question is his i think we have eliminated any and all excuses now no one can point any fingers
3210886 we respect cobi hes stepping in and filling a void
3210887 that said well see where we go with the head coaching position
3210888 i dont think were going to mandate or dictate that
3210889 we certainly could make a quick decision if thats whats necessary my guess is a lot of people will want to throw their name in the ring here
3210890 i think because of the ruud situation it was an opportunity to once and for all look for a fresh start
3210891 alexis been with us a long time im very appreciative of everything hes done for the galaxy that one is painful we havent made the playoffs for two years running and were headed for a third year you cant blame alexi entirely i do think we need a fresh start

3210917 it was a pleasure to work in a bipartisan spirit with house and senate leaders to act quickly to support our economy and create jobs this year our cooperative effort demonstrates to the nation and the world that we can come together to address the needs of the american people
3210918 as soon as this legislation is passed by both houses the irs will begin its work to get payments out to more than 130 million americans the irs will manage the current tax filing season and simultaneously prepare to issue these additional payments starting in early may payments will be largely completed this summer putting cash in the hands of millions of americans at a time when our economy is experiencing slower growth

3210948 memorandum ini bertujuan meminta beliau menteri besar selangor menarik balik kenyataannya kerana bertentangan dengan prinsip penubuhan uitm sebagai sebuah institusi pengajian tinggi bagi melahirkan profesional di kalangan bumiputera
3210949 this visit will open a new page in the relations between both countries
3210950 it will help to benefit both of these brotherly nations and will support the security of iraq and the region
3210951 we learned that many insurgents want to hand themselves over but because of the raids and operations they feared they might be killed
3210952 so the prime minister made this decision to encourage them to stop fighting
3210953 i do things for my boyfriend just because i want to do so and i dont expect him to show do anything in return
3210954 is it wise to have a propane facility of this kind immediately adjacent to residential properties
3210955 obviously in light of what happened the answer is no
3210956 the yard had a right to be there a legal right
3210957 were going to investigate whether thats appropriate from the citys perspective were also going to work with the provincial regulator who oversees these kinds of facilities to make sure the regulations are being followed and are adequate to protect torontonians
3210958 at the federal level there are rules that govern the transportation of dangerous and toxic compounds and that includes propane
3210959 when a city is looking at where theyre going to locate a facility all of those federal rules and regulations are applied but its up to the city to actually make the rules
3210960 we have very strict regulations in place and a very robust safety system
3210961 if this is a 1 6 kilometre area of evacuation why isnt the propane yard 1 6 kilometres away
3210962 i was very surprised to the see the pictures of the explosion
3210963 its very typical of what youd normally see in this type of the facility when things go awry
3210964 something like 500 people died in that explosion and in toronto it could have been as bad as that
3210965 were just fortunate that our fire department was able to get a lot of water on these tanks when flame impinges on these pressurized tanks they literally explode sending shrapnel in all sorts of areas
3210966 what you get at a stroke center versus a community hospital is a more in depth and higher level of care
3210967 we see twice the number of stroke patients as the next hospital in this city like anything else its practice practice practice the more you have done it the better you are going to be at it
3210968 it is a very small number of patients who stand to benefit
3210969 will be just as well served if not better served by being cared for at their local community hospital provided that the local community hospital is doing the right stuff
3210970 we train paramedics to treat stroke like a trauma incident
3210971 its a race against time trying to get the artery open
3210972 taking out the blood flow to the whole right side of his brain
3210973 half of us think it works and the other half think it doesnt
3210974 all i know is that half of us are wrong and i dont know which one it is
3210975 he was well one minute and then not i guess hes in the best place he could be
3210976 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3210977 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3210978 household purchasing power is declining mainly due to rising consumer prices
3210979 exports the driver of above trend growth in the past three quarters have turned lower and external demand may make a negative contribution to growth
3210980 the economy does appear to have entered a cyclical downswing reflecting the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade and slowing global demand
3210981 the economy has eliminated excesses built up in the aftermath of the late 1980s bubble and the fundamentals of the economy are much better than in the previous post bubble cycles
3210982 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3210983 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3210984 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3210985 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3210986 we have to wrap up the question of qualification to the group stage at home
3210987 artmedia are a team that score a lot but we are solid at the back and im not worried
3210988 at manchester we again showed we are reliable in defence
3210989 given your committees recent focus on deep packet inspection in connection with advertising we feel it important to state clearly and for the record that google does not deliver advertising based on deep packet inspection
3210990 in our quickly evolving business environment ensuring that we can keep our users trust is an essential constant for building the best possible products with every google product we work hard to earn and keep that trust with a longstanding commitment to protect the privacy of our users personal information the bedrock of our privacy practices are three fundamentals providing transparency choice and security
3210991 increasingly there are no limits technologically as to what a company can do in terms of collecting information and then selling it as a commodity to other providers
3210992 our responsibility is to make sure that we create a law that regardless of the technology includes a set of legal guarantees that consumers have with respect to their information
3210993 insight into the number of people who have seen an ad campaign

3211003 we have reached some areas that had been isolated for two days
3211004 we are focusing on finding the people still missing its bad we are afraid they are dead and well have to recover their bodies
3211005 it shows that if you protect these animals then they can recover
3211006 im encouraged by the fact that several of the large whale species that had been in trouble for a long time have shown steady increases over recent decades
3211007 humpbacks have really shown an ability to recover strongly from extremely intensive hunting
3211008 it takes a while for conservationists to build up the confidence that it is a real signal of recovery and not a short term variation
3211009 it is a political question and it will be answered in a political form
3211010 i think it is really important to stress that the red list is not about whether a given species can be exploited
3211011 its simply about looking at the status of these animals and giving people some idea where they are now in relation to where they used to be
3211012 the trouble is that the nets that cause the most trouble the entangling nets that are unselective in what they catch are still being used
3211013 i think we are just seeing the start of the effects of climate change in the oceans another big problem is noise from sonar which we dont fully understand yet
3211014 preventing deliberate harm of that species has been ongoing for nearly a century and has been pretty effective
3211015 but the numbers that are killed in ship strikes and become entangled in lines from lobster and crab traps are preventing the population which is not very big in the first place recovering
3211016 how you stop or reduce that is a real challenge
3211017 the data deficient category is pretty large for cetaceans probably surprisingly large to many people
3211018 it is the species that live far offshore that are found in less developed parts of the world that in many cases we dont have a clue about how many there are
3211019 the president thanks you for your untiring fight your strong fight to restore constitutional order
3211020 i asked the mauritanian officials for a meeting with the former president but they rejected my demand but they assured me that he is in a good health and in a good living conditions
3211021 i am worried that international aid might not be allowed to get to the region because of politics
3211022 i also am praying that the authorities can come to a peaceful diplomatic solution to this fighting for the sake of the thousands of people who have already been killed and injured and for those who will be if this war continues
3211023 pray for the families and children trapped in the fighting also pray for mikhail saakashvili president of georgia and for russian prime minister vladimir putin pray that god will give them wisdom to resolve this conflict
3211024 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come
3211025 on the face of it the government has made great strides they the tigers are really hemmed in this time
3211026 im just not sure the military progress can be translated into political progress
3211027 my wife is on edge from the moment i leave home until the moment i return
3211028 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators
3211029 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now
3211030 the worry is that what seems like a passing phase might become a way of life
3211031 they enable the creation of 3d models from simple 2d images and dynamic virtual environments from conventional photographs these products are used on many types of projects from architecture and photography to film and game development
3211032 autodesk imagemodeler 2009 crosses a new frontier in the field of architectural image based modeling it offers the possibility of integrating photos and panoramas for a complete interior and exterior structural survey
3211033 since the beginning stitcher has consistently been the fastest and most user friendly panoramic image editor
3211034 it remains the software of choice for our panoramic projects autodesk stitcher 2009 with its graphics accelerated previews and renders as well as the new automated features will make it even more indispensable to our panoramic workflows
3211035 autodesk motionbuilder 2009 is one of the most significant releases of the software since its inception
3211036 this version includes improved workflows for technical directors as well as an increased focus on interactivity with capture simulation and high quality rendering in real time it lets animators be more productive and puts total creative control into the hands of directors and cinematographers
3211037 autodesk motionbuilder has long been one of the most powerful and reliable character animation tools on the market both for keyframing and motion capture processing
3211038 as an animator i love the new rigid body physics and rag doll solvers in the 2009 version which help to perfect a multitude of movements that would otherwise be quite painful to capture realistically technical directors will also be happy to see the new python script editor and ability to create custom uis which will allow them to fully integrate motionbuilder into pipelines like ours
3211039 i think what phelps and lochte and a lot of those guys who are out there are doing for the sport of swimming is just incredible because its really putting it on the national stage
3211040 i love watching especially when they do the underwater footage the best way to improve yourself is to watch the fastest people in the world and see how theyre doing it and look at their technique

3211046 my impression is that how a lot of these things seem to work is that to overturn a commerce commission decision you need to prove that the commission has done something wrong in law as opposed to the economics of a decision
3211047 the big thing to note is that from vectors perspective at least its a relatively small part of their business thats being controlled so id be surprised if the market took too much notice
3211048 commission was transparent and consistent in its evaluative methodology and its reasoning was sound
3211049 the court confirmed the commissions view that reducing monopoly profits through lower prices is an obvious and significant benefit to gas consumers

3211063 we are celebrating the work done with autodesk maya over the past 10 years by many artists and creative visionaries in film television production and games as well as in industrial design and architecture
3211064 we designed maya 2009 as a tribute to creative innovation and production efficiency the new release will allow artists to raise the bar and deliver even more ground breaking computer graphics work
3211065 the future of maya is shining brightly with the upcoming release
3211066 autodesk maya 2009 will change the way artists think about dynamics rendering compositing and pipelines with the solid mental ray multi render pass workflow production will be far more effective this new workflow will optimize render times for multiple render layers and in turn elevate the quality of work the creation of nparticles builds on the unified dynamics engine introduced in ncloth allowing for greater integration of advanced effects
3211067 the worst people skills of anyone i have ever met
3211068 its pretty self evident that the uplift in the second half in terms of eps earnings per share is fundamentally different and stronger than the first half
3211069 theyre not mutually exclusive and ive said previously that our job is to run the bank for the interests of st george shareholders
3211070 the proposal by westpac is subject to it being in the interests of shareholders and clearly weve put that to the market place
3211071 westpac would know from its due diligence process the underlying performance of the group and so does the market
3211072 and then parallel to that weve also got the independent experts report being progressed as well
3211073 i can only deal with what ive got at the moment which is lots of transparency around the business to the market
3211074 and that westpac has also seen the visibility of the bank through its due diligence process as well

3211076 the sharp slowdown in domestic demand continued through july and more importantly that the rate of slowing has in recent months accelerated
3211077 the now large falls in sales and especially profits have begun to reflect in reduced labour hiring and a significant easing in capacity utilisation
3211078 no one is willing to step in and buy the aussie
3211079 scope to move to a less restrictive monetary policy stance in the period ahead is increasing
3211080 the slowdown in sales and profits has now reached a stage where business has revised not just future employment intentions but is currently reducing employment in the non farm business sector

3211088 a growing number of post production facilities are embracing autodesk toxik as a companion to autodesk maya
3211089 as the entertainment industry grapples with the challenges of stereoscopic production toxik 2009 bridges 3d and 2d workflows facilitating the production of stereoscopic films and virtual set extensions
3211090 were already working with autodesk maya and autodesk flame so toxik was a natural choice for our pipeline it gives us the power of a node based compositor necessary for professional high end post production work along with a look and feel thats completely comfortable
3211091 the toxik softwares tight integration with maya and intuitive color correction tools have improved the way i composite toxik lets me focus on finishing shots faster as i no longer have to worry about data management

3211118 dont worry too much your hair grows pretty quickly right
3211119 for a normal healthy pregnancy the hospital environment is overkill
3211120 interventions that neither the mother nor father wish to occur are more likely when surrounded by people who view pregnancy as an illness or labor as inherently dangerous
3211121 i consider birth sacred and a joy and i intend to birth my baby in a way that reflects that
3211122 legislating against home birth is totally un american and unfair
3211123 we rank 42nd in the world in live births and we spend more money than anyone else you cant blame it on home birth
3211124 unless theres ready access to certain emergency personnel and equipment and even surgery youre potentially endangering babies and moms health and lives
3211125 weve all seen scenarios where mothers came in after very major blood loss in a very catastrophic state
3211126 by the time they arrive in the hospital youre sort of behind the eight ball in trying to resuscitate these patients the same thing with neonatal outcome
3211127 it is just a true testament to how well beijing has done allowing the athletes to perform at their peak and that is awesome that is what you want at an olympics and they have done an amazing job as a host
3211128 obviously we are seeing some very fast times and we have seen a number of world records so obviously it is a fantastic setup as an australian it feels a lot like our sydney olympic park i really enjoy racing there i have raced quite well there so obviously having the same feeling about the pool in beijing makes it easier i think we are going to see a lot more fast racing to come
3211129 well can you just bake some fries for me or something
3211130 if your head is wax stay out of the heat
3211131 dude ive been to bangkok and aint seen sh t like this
3211132 i enjoyed a pricey but genuinely fun celebratory meal at this location of gyu kaku with two of my best friends last month and i have to say
3211133 the chinese team are the most improved team in the world
3211134 they had some great shots and we found ourselves on the defence
3211135 today i found my team after many months of bad bad bad
3211136 weve never had fewer factory jobs than we do today
3211137 what we do is look at what skills they have do those skills fill a need employers are looking for because there are still employers looking for people
3211138 to develop and enhance their skills they have to build skills they have and to make them become somebody valuable to an employer
3211139 we always have enough drugs in store the patient s family had not been asked to get the medicines and these were supplied from our stock local councillor shyamali bhadra instigated the mob by holding us responsible for the patient s death
3211140 we were surprised as no one had told us about the medicines till monday morning the hospital staff then claimed that the drugs had been given kanan could have been saved had these been administered
3211141 we have detained eight of those who had forced their way into the super s room said an officer
3211142 we took him back home but his condition didnt improve
3211143 we tried our best to save him but failed there was no negligence
3211144 but i realised it was quite easy to succeed in it
3211145 i realized learning to fly was easy or would be easy
3211146 nevertheless there is an positive side if you know how to fly in bad weather conditions such as in windy conditions
3211147 deck construction flight 13 we were off to the races
3211148 we in russia we cannot see how we can do business with him
3211149 the immediate and unconditional cessation of hostilities and the complete withdrawal of russian and georgian forces to their positions prior to august 7
3211150 to take further action as appropriate to help bring about and implement a peaceful and durable solution to the crisis
3211151 holy crap im giving birth holy crap when did i get pregnant
3211152 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3211153 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3211154 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3211155 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3211156 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3211157 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3211158 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3211159 maybe you dont go into design its not a bad thing
3211160 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
3211161 the constitution of the united i would like to thank each and everyone of you once again for you commitment
3211162 merry christmas happy holidays amp a very profitable happy new year
3211163 i congratulate the senate leaders for their quick action to pass a bipartisan economic growth package that is temporary broad based and will get money into our economy quickly
3211164 it was a pleasure to work in a bipartisan spirit with house and senate leaders to act quickly to support our economy and create jobs this year our cooperative effort demonstrates to the nation and the world that we can come together to address the needs of the american people
3211165 as soon as this legislation is passed by both houses the irs will begin its work to get payments out to more than 130 million americans the irs will manage the current tax filing season and simultaneously prepare to issue these additional payments starting in early may payments will be largely completed this summer putting cash in the hands of millions of americans at a time when our economy is experiencing slower growth
3211166 n o estou sabendo de nada n o acertamos nada com a gr cia portanto ele n o embarca
3211167 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3211168 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3211169 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3211170 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3211171 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3211172 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3211173 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3211174 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3211175 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3211176 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3211177 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3211178 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3211179 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3211180 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3211181 but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security
3211182 the constitution of the united i would like to thank each and everyone of you once again for you commitment
3211183 merry christmas happy holidays amp a very profitable happy new year

3211186 as soon as this legislation is passed by both houses the irs will begin its work to get payments out to more than 130 million americans the irs will manage the current tax filing season and simultaneously prepare to issue these additional payments starting in early may payments will be largely completed this summer putting cash in the hands of millions of americans at a time when our economy is experiencing slower growth
3211187 it looks like im getting some new toys in a day or two
3211188 after 11 months it looks like ill get some attention
3211189 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3211190 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3211191 any of the campaigns that would have tried to push that would have been burned by it
3211192 i cant say i understand the rules of the media and im not sure they do either
3211193 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3211194 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3211195 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3211196 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3211197 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3211198 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3211199 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3211200 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3211201 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3211202 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3211203 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3211204 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3211205 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3211206 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3211207 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3211208 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3211209 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3211210 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3211211 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3211212 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3211213 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3211214 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3211215 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3211216 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3211217 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3211218 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3211219 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3211220 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3211221 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3211222 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3211223 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3211224 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3211225 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3211226 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3211227 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3211228 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3211229 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3211230 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3211231 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3211232 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3211233 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3211234 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3211235 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3211236 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3211237 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3211238 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3211239 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3211240 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3211241 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3211242 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3211243 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3211244 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3211245 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3211246 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3211247 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3211248 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3211249 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3211250 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3211251 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3211252 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3211253 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3211254 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3211255 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3211256 i had a great time in england and people were so nice to me all week
3211257 we had great waves at the start and tough ones today but it was always lots of fun so stoked to get this first title such a big thing it is a great confidence boost for the upcoming events
3211258 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3211259 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3211260 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3211261 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3211262 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3211263 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3211264 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3211265 just so you all know we did set a record
3211266 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3211267 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3211268 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3211269 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3211270 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3211271 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3211272 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3211273 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3211274 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3211275 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3211276 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3211277 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3211278 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3211279 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3211280 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3211281 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3211282 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3211283 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3211284 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3211285 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3211286 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3211287 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3211288 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3211289 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3211290 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3211291 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3211292 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3211293 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3211294 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3211295 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3211296 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3211297 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3211298 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3211299 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3211300 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3211301 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3211302 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3211303 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3211304 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3211305 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3211306 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3211307 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3211308 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3211309 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3211310 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3211311 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3211312 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3211313 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3211314 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3211315 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3211316 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3211317 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3211318 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3211319 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3211320 i cannot see us accepting this french draft vitaly churkin said referring to a french drafted text agreed by western ambassadors
3211321 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3211322 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3211323 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3211324 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3211325 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3211326 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3211327 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3211328 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3211329 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3211330 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3211331 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3211332 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3211333 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3211334 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3211335 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3211336 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3211337 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3211338 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3211339 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3211340 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3211341 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3211342 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3211343 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for
3211344 comment by bruce in miami august 8 2008 at 9 54 am
3211345 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3211346 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3211347 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3211348 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3211349 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3211350 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3211351 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3211352 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3211353 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3211354 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3211355 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3211356 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3211357 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3211358 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3211359 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3211360 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3211361 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3211362 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3211363 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3211364 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3211365 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3211366 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3211367 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3211368 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3211369 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3211370 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3211371 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3211372 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3211373 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3211374 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3211375 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3211376 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3211377 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3211378 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3211379 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3211380 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3211381 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3211382 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3211383 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3211384 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3211385 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3211386 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3211387 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3211388 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3211389 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3211390 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3211391 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3211392 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3211393 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3211394 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3211395 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3211396 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3211397 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3211398 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3211399 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3211400 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3211401 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3211402 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3211403 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3211404 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3211405 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3211406 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3211407 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3211408 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3211409 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3211410 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3211411 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3211412 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3211413 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3211414 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3211415 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3211416 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3211417 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3211418 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3211419 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3211420 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3211421 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3211422 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3211423 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3211424 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3211425 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3211426 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3211427 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3211428 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3211429 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3211430 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3211431 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3211432 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3211433 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3211434 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3211435 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3211436 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3211437 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3211438 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3211439 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3211440 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3211441 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3211442 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3211443 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3211444 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3211445 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3211446 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3211447 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3211448 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3211449 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3211450 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3211451 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3211452 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3211453 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3211454 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3211455 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable

3211462 remember that time i called you a complete slutbag i meant it you really are just bag of slut
3211463 good news i was able to arrange for a flight out to the lake to see you for the rest of the season and its free and its in half an hour see you soon kisses asian boyfriend
3211464 sorry i dont think its gonna happen see you in a month
3211465 remember that time i called you a complete slutbag i meant it you really are just bag of slut
3211466 i hope the guy shes with messes with her head like shes doing to you
3211467 you might find the love you need if you can learn to stop hanging on to your feelings for a former lover
3211468 i dont get you weve been talking for over a year now and we havent seen each other yet why
3211469 you might find the love you need if you can learn to stop hanging on to your feelings for a former lover
3211470 why dont you let me tell you whats going on
3211471 ive never missed practice its frustrating it was awkward for me very awkward it was frustrating standing there ive never been on the outside like that watching a practice im going to do whatever i can to make sure that doesnt happen again
3211472 i havent missed a practice since god knows how long
3211473 obviously you can tell im frustrated but the only thing i can do is try to get back healthy and come back
3211474 you never want to sit there and watch for me im not used to it its frustrating thats why you do whatever you can to get back you need to be out there you need to practice in order to get better
3211475 he was still out there watching the play but you could see that he was completely out of place
3211476 its a weird feeling when youre standing there watching the practice i know its killing him but that speaks a lot about him hes a tough guy he loves to be out there every day
3211477 he told brett to stand up and name everybody on the team just like coach mangini always does
3211478 brett was like i cant do that we poked fun at him for having to take orders because brett is older he just laughed i think he enjoyed it
3211479 laveranues he can throw it farther than quarterback chad pennington took it as an insult the wide receiver apparently still upset by penningtons release glared at the fan and muttered an expletive
3211480 he has the innate ability to look one way and still know how to go the other way and get the ball there in time
3211481 a lot of quarterbacks cant go from this side to that side and still fit the ball in hes one of the guys that can he keeps you honest you cant really cheat
3211482 why give up a steady paycheck in order to labor in relative obscurity
3211483 if you want your game to make money you have to consider what will sell and this means adapting your pure creative vision to match the real world besides do you really have the resources to achieve your ultimate creative vision
3211484 an indie game made by a very small team can compete with giant games that had huge budgets at their disposal
3211485 these are people for whom game development is not a primary profession whose background is not in computer science or 3 d modeling who build games in their spare time out of a curiosity and love for the medium and a desire to make the games that no one else will hobbyist game developers self published authors videogame zinesters
3211486 people could still actually make money out of their games and that wouldnt hurt their artistic value
3211487 its just that when you know you have to earn at least x with this game or otherwise your company will go bankrupt or you yourself will not be able to pay the rent that art must be compromised and that it may seem a much better idea to make a game about shooting space aliens than about the moral options left to someone who recognises the monstrous within himself
3211488 the reasons for this have to do with things like perceived value and invested resources but short also notes a less discussed reason the perceived contract between player and game designer and that some players
3211489 in the absence of money or even a guarantee of reviews without either the market forces or the critical cadre it can be difficult to maintain serious ambitions in creating a freeware project especially a large one
3211490 the sense that i had long since passed every conceivable sane reason to be doing what i was doing the creeping fear that what i was doing could not possibly be worth the time and energy i was putting into it the sense of being reduced as a person to a single purpose since normal hobbies and enjoyments and work had all been set aside
3211491 the monks brew is a blog about indie game design development and play with a particular emphasis on the adventure genre it is brought to you by rubes an indie game developer from salt lake city utah
3211492 rubes mike rubin is an indie game developer who started gaming with text adventures and this book even before the heyday of the apple hes also the budding pioneer of a new genre in computer gaming three dimensional interactive fiction 3d if his first project in this genre is vespers
3211493 vespers is an adaptation of jason devlins interactive fiction work of the same name it is an experiment to discover what kind of horribly disfigured offspring might result from the mating of an if engine with a 3d first person graphics engine
3211494 i will say i dont want this to linger too much longer
3211495 i should make my final decision pretty soon whatever that is i want to make sure its 100 percent sure
3211496 a strengthening of our commitment to r amp d throughout disney

3211500 i called her to make sure she was bringing her award uniform with her
3211501 seen last shot finishes before it doesnt happen to athletes that are quitters its those people that always believe theyve got to dream they can do it
3211502 my goal was to be on the 2012 olympic team so to win a medal at the olympics is really a dream come true
3211503 no one who is bound by carnal desires and pleasures is worthy to come to you to approach you or to minister to you the king of glory for to minister to you is great and awesome even to the heavenly powers themselves
3211504 after coming fourth in my heat i know it was really up to chance to see what the next heat did to see if i got in the final
3211505 but lucky they went slow so im in the final
3211506 i know that im going to have to go faster to be up there for a medal chance in the final
3211507 i was still about a second off my best time so i think ill need to go out harder and also bring it home stronger
3211508 do i believe i can improve as a player yes
3211509 i have probably been the leading player in europe for close to six years
3211510 its a big step to move up now and start competing on a different level im world number three and ive got phil and tiger ahead of me
3211511 i dont necessarily pay attention to what theyre doing i pay attention more to what im doing
3211512 i am maturing as a player throughout my career ive always applied myself looked for what would improve my game found that and worked on it to improve
3211513 but its always taken some time ive had lulls where ive been in between things and come out stronger
3211514 it is a long way to catch tiger at the top but i know the only way of focusing on doing that is focusing on me what im doing controlling what i can do i cant control tiger or phil
3211515 i probably pushed too hard on the 17th hole thinking i needed to get back after making my first bogey of the day on the 16th
3211516 but i walked away from that tournament knowing i could win a major sometimes youve got to lose them to know you can win them
3211517 they were removing some adhesive they had removed some flooring before from what i understand there was some advesive that remained from that and they were using solvents and chemicals to remove the adhesives
3211518 the kitchen the stairwell and downstairs seems to have substantial damage theres no indication of foul play at least right now
3211519 at this point its water under the bridge theres no reason to dwell on it
3211520 im thankful that things worked out where i was able to stay and be the starting quarterback here when its all said and done thats what really matters to me
3211521 its getting better unfortunately its a slower process than i would hope it would be but im making strides in the right direction
3211522 obviously hes very questionable wed like to get him to the point where he can operate at full speed again
3211523 and until he can we wont play him but its good to have him in the huddle thats for sure
3211524 im just a journeyman according to some people why should i have any hard feelings im thankful to have this job i might pay bruce and jon
3211525 what am i going to say its the unfortunate part of the business thats what this sport is it has two sides its obviously a game for all of those who play on the field and who love to play the game but there is a business side too

3211562 the right to self determination does not come with a right to secede
3211563 its a right to autonomy to minority rights and the like it only becomes a right to secede when were talking about a situation of genocide hence when fundamental basic and human rights are no longer guaranteed
3211564 but in my opinion we dont have such a situation in south ossetia nor abkhazia
3211565 theres no recognition by other countries theres no enforcement of authority within its territory theres always been dispute between georgia and south ossetia

3211569 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3211570 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3211571 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3211572 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3211573 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3211574 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3211575 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3211576 the cold war has long ended but the mentality of the cold war has stayed firmly in the minds of several u s diplomats it is a real shame
3211577 urgently seeking international intervention to prevent the fall of georgia
3211578 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3211579 i cant really see much in the way of western leverage
3211580 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3211581 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3211582 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3211583 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3211584 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3211585 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3211586 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3211587 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3211588 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3211589 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3211590 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3211591 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3211592 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3211593 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3211594 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3211595 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3211624 the representatives and commissioners were there with me in saying that property taxes went up because under johns tenure at the department of health and human services bills were simply not paid and someone else had to pay thats not cost saving thats cost shifting
3211625 i would contend thats not the kind of leadership we need in washington
3211626 i looked up the rates when i took over as commissioner the rates for carroll county was 137 in 2003 per day per senior when i left it was 169 dollars 30 percent increase in carroll county in the rates being made a 30 percent increase and thats what you call it a cost shift when property tax payers are hurt
3211627 you know at the ending of the day jeb youre not a fiscal conservative
3211628 yes or no commissioner are you voting for that defense bill or not
3211629 jeb im going to washington to bring change i dont want to have any representative of congress ever where you have to vote for all this wasteful pork

3211631 us military surprised by speed timing of russia military action
3211632 we were tracking it earlier in that week and we knew that things were escalating
3211633 i can tell you it moved quicker than we anticipated that first day
3211634 i think a lot of what youre asking needs to be ironed out
3211635 some of these little issues are definitely still big questions in this event what was the intent who started it why did they start it and why werent they prepared to defend what they started
3211636 we dont see anything that supports they are in gori
3211637 once it did happen they were able to get the forces quickly and it was just a matter of taking the roads in so its not as though they were building up forces on the border waiting
3211638 what are their future intentions i dont know obviously they could throw more troops at this if they wanted to
3211639 this is my city i will never leave it even if the russians come here and kill me why should i go to tbilisi and wait for them there
3211640 we have lived with the russians for 100 years so why do we need this war now i dont want to be with america i think we should live peacefully with the russians
3211641 i am currently serving in afghanistan with the delta company 2 108th infantry ny army national guard out of ithaca

3211648 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english the literature of the past will for the most part not be translated into this language since its outlook and emotional background will be considered unsettling serious students of history will be able to obtain a permit from the government to study such works as hamlet and othello but the general public will be forbidden access to them on the ground that they glorify private murder boys will not be allowed to read books about pirates or red indians love themes will be discouraged on the ground that love being anarchic is silly if not wicked all this will make life very pleasant for the virtuous
3211649 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
3211650 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
3211651 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
3211652 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
3211653 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
3211654 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
3211655 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations democratic forms may be preserved in politics but they will not have as much reality as in a community of small peasant proprietors officials unavoidably have power and where many vital questions are so technical that the ordinary man cannot hope to understand them experts must inevitably acquire a considerable measure of control take the question of currency and credit as an example william jennings bryan it is true made currency an electoral issue in 1896 but the men who voted for him were men who would have voted for him whatever issue he had selected at the present time calculable misery is being caused by a wrong handling of the question of currency and credit but it is impossible to submit this question to the electorate except in some passionate and unscientific form the only way in which anything can be done is to convince the officials who control the great central banks so long as these men act honestly and in accordance with tradition the community cannot control them since if they are mistaken very few people will know it to take a less important illustration everyone who has ever compared british and american methods of handling goods traffic on railways knows that the american methods are infinitely superior there are no private trucks and the trucks of the railways are of standard size capable of carrying forty tons in england everything is higgledy piggledy and unsystematic and the use of private trucks causes great waste if this were put right freights could be reduced and consumers would benefit since there would be no obvious gain either to railway companies or to railway workers if a more uniform system is ever imposed it will be done not as a result of a democratic demand but by government officials the scientific society will be just as oligarchic under socialism or communism as under capitalism for even where the forms of democracy exist they cannot supply the ordinary voter with the requisite knowledge nor enable him to be on the spot at the crucial moment the men who understand the complicated mechanism of a modern community and who have the habit of initiative and decision must inevitably control the course of events to a very great extent perhaps this is even more true in a socialistic state than in any other for in a socialistic state economic and political power are concentrated in the same hands and the national organization of the economic life is more complete than in a state where private enterprise exists moreover a socialistic state is likely to have more perfect control than any other over the organs of publicity and propaganda so that it will have more power of causing men to know what it wishes known and not to know what it wishes unknown equality therefore like liberty is i fear no more than a nineteenth century dream the world of the future will contain a governing class probably not hereditary but more analogous to the government of the catholic church and this governing class as they acquire increasing knowledge and confidence will interfere more and more with the life of the individual and will learn more and more the technique of causing this interference to be tolerated it may be assumed that their purposes will be excellent and their conduct honourable it may be assumed that they will be well informed and industrious but it cannot i think be assumed that they will abstain from the exercise of power merely on the ground that individual initiative is a good thing or on the ground that an oligarchy is unlikely to consider the true interests of its slaves for men capable of such self restraint will not rise to positions of power which except when they are hereditary are attained only by those who are energetic and untroubled by doubt

3211692 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
3211693 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
3211694 when you are training an elite athlete every aspect of their health and physical skills should be assessed and if possible improved it is natural to think of nutrition and weight training but traditional training is not enough anymore
3211695 scientific developments like the achievevision program developed by the vision care institute offer new techniques to help our athletes perform at their peak and allow coaches athletes and trainers to ensure vision is helping not hindering their performance the british olympic association has installed the achievevision program equipment at bisham abbey national sports centre with the support of visual performance skills consultant dr sherylle calder to allow eye care professionals coaches and trainers to customize vision care for each athlete
3211696 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in beijing
3211697 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives
3211698 being included in the olympics has changed our sport dramatically
3211699 every year its getting stronger you can tell with the olympic committee putting this many seats in
3211700 the crowds now really get involved and have respect for the sport whereas the first time they didnt really understand
3211701 we have no real fixed facilities we just put up stands on a beach or tip sand into a tennis court which means its expensive to set up tournaments

3211708 we are expecting the white democrats to be fleeing the democratic ship when november 4 comes around plus the democratic candidate bob conley that is running against senator lindsey graham is also running away from the democrats and you can quote me on that

3211712 we have to wrap up the question of qualification to the group stage at home
3211713 artmedia are a team that score a lot but we are solid at the back and im not worried
3211714 the important point is they havent produced for us that verification regime that we need to go forward on that issue
3211715 what we need from the north koreans is a strong verification regime thats our policy and it still stands
3211716 the process has already been protracted and so it is already clear that this administration is not going to be able to achieve its stated goal
3211717 that means that the next administration is going to inherit this problem and it may be possibly what dprk north korea had intended all along

3211723 we appreciate the allegations of fraud and abuse in the h 1b program as well as the allegations that h 1b foreign workers have negatively impacted u s workers while acip believes that visa fraud is an important issue we do not believe it has a statistically significant impact on the availability of h 1b visas most fraud is concentrated in a few consular posts some of the fraud is illegitimate companies using the h 1b visa to accommodate relatives or friends but the numbers are small other fraud relates to fake credentials in cooperation with u s employers ins and the state department have made significant strides at ferreting out fraudulent credentials acip strongly supports the expansion of such efforts at the same time we oppose increasing scrutiny of all employers or restricting the availability of h 1b visas as these will have little impact on fraud

3211727 sounds to me as if cuil is in it infancy stage and once it builds its resources they will be as good or better than the current search engines available but like you i wont be hanging up on google either
3211728 what is not cuil is their suppresson and censoring of what they may consider sensitive material not that im a fan of pornography but to suppress information that could be historically significant to researchers is against the us constitution
3211729 i think its great if they can filter out the porn sites so i dont have to see those in the search results
3211730 i like the privacy policy of cuil so much that i made it my home page the search works well enough
3211731 google gives me everything i need in a search engine but i cant help feeling uncomfortable when one entity dominates to the extent that google does that is why i have cuil on my toolbar and why i am using it for my primary searches
3211732 when i do a search i dont want to get 72 million hits
3211733 cuil sucks right now until they hire some real programmers and get away from their smoke and mirrors show i will happily continue using google
3211734 when they first launched i put the term cuil in their search engine nothing related to their search engine came up i tried again today it has one relevant result the rest are not ive tried it several times and dont get relevant search results a lot of the time im sure it will get better but they seem to be light years behind google
3211735 i just tried searching my company name in cuil and it never even came up it was the number 1 result in google and within the top 5 on another search engine
3211736 i tried cuil for an hour with some conventional searches that i have used to test search engines and some imaginative ones the results were a disaster there is nothing worse than introducing a product to the market before it is ready for it particularly when there is no time pressure at all
3211737 the numbers of hits dont really mean anything i have found that many of the hits i get on searches have little or nothing to do with what i am searching for someone cleverly adds words to the meta info to get hits from searches regardless of whether the site has anything to do with your search terms ive used them all and msn live search are my main choices if i get 10 000 results as opposed to 100 000 it means less garbage to sift through in my search not an indication that my chosen search engine isnt as thorough as google or any other search engine
3211738 as far as search engines in general my best results come from using
3211739 i do depend on a good search engine yes however i use google only when i cant find what i want on the one i do use good search if you want to check out a cool search engine that is one to check out good search allows me to donate money to my favorite charity their concept is you search we give

3211748 when my father died of hunger i believed that it was an isolated phenomenon
3211749 during the cultural revolution the governor of hubei said that 300 000 had died in the province during those three years
3211750 then i realised that the tragedy in my family was not isolated census figures revealed that between 1959 and 1960 the population dropped by 10 million
3211751 i felt a sense of responsibility if i did not write this book it would be more difficult for those after me this is a huge historical burden which must be lifted sooner or later
3211752 in the second half of 1959 i took a long distance bus from xinyang to luoshan and gushi
3211753 out of the window i saw one corpse after another in the ditches on the bus no one dared to mention the dead in one county guangshan one third of the people had died although there were dead people everywhere the local leaders enjoyed good meals and fine liquor
3211754 i had seen people who had told the truth being destroyed
3211755 i went to one village and saw 100 corpses then another village and another 100 corpses no one paid attention to them people said that dogs were eating the bodies not true i said the dogs had long ago been eaten by the people
3211756 the party committee of xinyang reported to beijing the deaths of 1 05 million people i do not consider that too much
3211757 in xinyang people starved at the doors of the grain warehouses
3211758 as they died they shouted communist party chairman mao save us if the granaries of henan and hebei had been opened no one need have died as people were dying in large numbers around them officials did not think to save them their only concern was how to fulfil the delivery of grain
3211759 was man made there was small scale violence against the shortages and an increase in crime by the hungry but nothing large and organised people were terrorised and did not dare oppose the government and the army
3211760 my book was based on materials that were publicly available his contains additional material it is very valuable
3211761 among scholars in china there is no disagreement on the figure of 30 million dead in my book i said at least 35 million and that was based only on published material some said it was too low

3211763 hi my name is joanna milo and i am the c e o of execucomm llc the most trusted name in vocabulary building over three and a half years ago our company set out to create a new software program that would help people truly master new vocabulary words without having to memorize definitions
3211764 stop wasting time memorizing word definitions amp start truly mastering vocabulary words today
3211765 i love the power vocabulary builders intuitive interface i think the filters are great i wish i had this preparing for the sats my favorites are the categories for business negotiating critique and compliment ive also recommended pvb to friends who were preparing to take the gmat and gre tests since pvb filters for most tests overall this program is an invaluable tool that is easy to use and is a must have in my opinion
3211766 after several years in management consulting and working for two marketing agencies with frequent client senior management exposure power vocabulary builder has been an enormously effective tool for me to communicate better and more precisely the application is on my laptop so i can expand my active vocabulary on my own time at home or when im traveling for business the power of words goes a long way
3211767 the power vocabulary builder is such an easy tool to use the interface is sleek and very user friendly and i was able to start learning new words immediately with no instructions what a great tool it has been for my daily job duties i am able to communicate with my customers and management team with a higher level of confidence because the words i can use are more advanced thanks
3211768 after using the power vocabulary builder tool both my written and verbal communication has noticeably improved email communication is especially critical to how i communicate with my team i must choose my words carefully in order to articulate my message with the appropriate tone and meaning i have a bigger pool of advanced words to choose from now sincere thanks for helping me improve my communication skills
3211769 the power vocabulary builder makes learning vocabulary fun and easy what i like best about the program is that i seem to recall words easier than i used to when i simply looked words up in the dictionary
3211770 the power vocabulary builder has helped me to improve my communication skills after just a couple weeks of using the program i was able to better articulate my ideas with precision and poise its been great so far
3211771 i have wanted to start improving my vocabulary for some time now i tried the word of the day programs but felt they were too boring what i love about pvb is that the program exercises list words in order of their use in business and the news media this has enabled me to focus my learning on the words i am most likely to encounter each day words that i can now use to better communicate my points of view the power vocabulary builder has been the perfect catalyst for improving my vocabulary
3211772 the power vocabulary builder has helped me to be more confident speaking with my peers i have also received greater recognition for my contributions in meetings this is the program i have been looking for
3211773 having both been raised in literary home environments by parents who advocated reading over television we have been actively searching for a vocabulary building solution that produces effective results while being interesting and time efficient we found what we were looking for in the power vocabulary builder now only weeks after creating and building our personalized tutorials our vocabulary has expanded in both our personal and professional lives

3211776 it really highlights what the chinese authorities are willing to do to silence people
3211777 some of the measures i think are a bit excessive but probably some it is understandable the nervousness of the authorities they dont know whats going to happen

3211790 i think people looking at this car are more interested in the freshness of the exterior not so much any major advance in engineering
3211791 the idea was to bring the price entry point down if we hadnt the car would have been very close to the c class sedan in price and that would have defeated the purpose of the model
3211792 you get a lot more car these days for similar value
3211793 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english
3211794 the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual
3211795 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
3211796 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
3211797 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
3211798 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
3211799 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
3211800 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
3211801 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations

3211817 some of the athletes know who they are and what they did
3211818 im 26 and just about know what they did though there are a lot of athletes younger than me who are still getting to know of the huge steps they took penn relays and last years athlete of the year awards so their faces are getting known now
3211819 you dont want to offend people or rile them whether voicing political or social points of view
3211820 as regards the athletes we have a rule 51 where athletes cannot make political religious or commercial propaganda or demonstrations
3211821 they have to respect the countrys laws and there must be none in the stadia or the podium they can express their views in the mixed zone but not propaganda
3211822 they the athletes will have the right to be heard and then we will see what action has to be taken

3211865 although the apparent crisis is about terrorism the real one is about energy scarcity an incisive account of the energy issue also explains the real functioning of the worlds economy and who controls it and how this shapes so much of our daily lives
3211866 no one can rationally say that the bush administration is incapable of lying

3211868 limits on the one resource that has propelled the human race to over expand and upon which the species is now dependent hydrocarbon energy an increasingly rapid stream of data and experience is ushering in what may be the most significant event in human history the end of the age of oil
3211869 there must be limitless growth into infinity for it to survive growth is not possible without energy there is nothing on our horizon other than wishful thinking that can completely replace hydrocarbon energy
3211870 if demand remains unchanged the world will run out of conventional oil within thirty five years

3211920 we know that to achieve enduring success we must address the personal family and community factors that cause young people to choose gangs over better more productive alternatives
3211921 we want our young people to choose something better than gang life and we need to do all we can to help them make that choice but for those who dont we need to let them know that we will not allow them to prey upon their neighbors who did make the right choice
3211922 this funding provides not only necessary resources but the flexibility for law enforcement in the chicago area along with our prevention and re entry partners to tailor their response to the gang problem here
3211923 to eradicate the gang threat in our communities the problem must be addressed at every stage and that is the approach being taken in chicago by both law enforcement and community organizations
3211924 gang activity in our community must be stopped and this office along with federal state and local law enforcement have pledged to eradicate gang violence in our streets

3211953 its fair to say there is a lot more emphasis at training and learning to kick into space under the old laws wings just chased or ran

3212107 are concerned about news media that publish or broadcast stories reports news releases and interviews prepared or paid for by hospitals
3212108 the ethics codes of the association of health care journalists and the society of professional journalists call for fair and accurate reporting and editorial independence but editorial cutbacks along with pressure on hospitals to market profitable services may be eroding these standards
3212109 in several recently reported cases local hospitals have exerted editorial control by supplying pre packaged stories and other content to news organizations in some but not all cases hospitals paid for this special influence
3212110 earlier this year a maryland newspaper sold its weekly health page to a local hospital and put the hospital in charge of providing content
3212111 the arrangement was halted amid community protest after just one published issue broadcast examples include airing of hospital produced segments with hazy branding or no branding at all leading viewers to believe the local station reported the story in some cases the hospital created material is even transmitted to a station through an affiliated news network
3212112 our journalistic mission requires us to hold doctors hospitals pharmaceutical companies and government agencies accountable to the public in doing so we commit to fair and transparent reporting of medical issues

3212117 no hay ninguna diferencia entre unos y otros pues todos han pecado y no han llegado a ser aprobados delante de dios
3212118 no es por medio de algo que uno hace de modo que nadie puede sentirse orgulloso
3212119 lo nico que el pecado da como pago es la muerte pero el regalo que dios da es vida eterna en uni n con cristo jes s nuestro se or
3212120 pero dios nos demuestra su amor en que cristo muri por nosotros aunque ramos todav a pecadores
3212121 pero lo cierto es que cristo fue resucitado de entre los muertos
3212122 pero a quienes lo recibieron a cristo y creyeron en l les concedi el privilegio de llegar a ser hijos de dios
3212123 pues dios am tanto al mundo que dio a su hijo nico para que todo aquel que cree en l no perezca sino que tenga vida eterna
3212124 cree en el se or jesucristo y ser s salvo
3212125 el que cree en el hijo tiene vida eterna pero el que reh sa creer en el hijo no ver la vida sino que la ira de dios est sobre l
3212126 y en ning n otro hay salvaci n porque no hay otro nombre bajo el cielo dado a los hombres en que podamos ser salvos
3212127 que si confesares con tu boca que jes s es el se or y creyeres en tu coraz n que dios le levant de los muertos ser s salvo
3212128 llevad mi yugo sobre vosotros y aprended de m que soy manso y humilde de coraz n y hallar is descanso para vuestras almas
3212129 en verdad les digo el que pone atenci n a lo que yo digo y cree en el que me envi tiene vida eterna y no ser condenado pues ha pasado ya de la muerte a la vida
3212130 este testimonio es que dios nos ha dado vida eterna y que esta vida est en su hijo el que tiene al hijo de dios tiene tambi n esta vida les escribo esto a ustedes que creen en el hijo de dios para que sepan que tienen vida eterna

3212168 we advocate federalism as a way to ensure long lasting peace in mindanao
3212169 she is calling for a constitutional amendment in order to bring about the bangsamoro juridical entity
3212170 an opportunity should be given to the whole country to avail of the reform effects of federalism the sentiment of many people there is to give local officials more authority in order to perform better and the federal set up is the way forward to this
3212171 the president has approved the way forward and theres no question about it if she has the political will to do it she has to muster political will in spite of all these noises
3212172 the timetable is come up with signing go to congress for enabling law a plebiscite is held when you discuss issue of governance then a final compact final peace agreement can be signed

3212183 ive been abroad and ive never seen this kind of thing before
3212184 a city has its character and mood and i would rather see buildings than us actor eddie murphy theres a need for ads but this is too much
3212185 i wanted to create an awakening because some 80 per cent of poles dont see a problem
3212186 most people walk through the city and they know something is wrong but cant pinpoint it
3212187 what were hoping to do is prove to the ioc that our sport is truly a global sport that its played around the world
3212188 i think its a disgrace they have taken baseball and softball out
3212189 this is the worst decision i couldve ever hear about
3212190 it was bigger than my 50 plus years with the dodgers
3212191 japan is the second nation to the united states that loves baseball
3212192 without the olympic baseball we will lose our baseball population all together
3212193 if the meeting decides not to put baseball back it will be very unfair because baseball is a very important sport
3212194 if a sport isnt germane to your culture a lot of time the tendency is to say well its boring or its not interesting baseball is one of those
3212195 our challenge is to expose our sport and whats good and unique about our sport to nations where its not a part of their culture
3212196 if this investment had been made the food bowl including the north south pipeline a decade ago there would now be 200 billion litres of water flowing down the murray river which would be available for environmental flows
3212197 i feel that that will be good for the governance of the northern territory because it will put pressure on government to provide adequate level of social services within the northern territory
3212198 mark mcardle is going to come in to the area of shadow health minister and that will mean that the deputy leader will look after health
3212199 dont forget to keep pedaling jackass you havent ridden fixed in a month
3212200 its hard to put that kind of race behind you
3212201 but it sets me up for something good the 200 free final thats my first priority
3212202 i just went out i dont want to say i cruised it but i just swam it
3212203 i just wanted to get into the finals and thats all i did it doesnt matter until the finals as long as you have a lane it doesnt matter where you are
3212204 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there
3212205 i was watching michael phelps after the anchor leg touched
3212206 the whole thing is genuine thats the good thing about the olympics
3212207 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3212208 jason is the most phenomenal closer ive ever seen in my life
3212209 hes been able to get his hand on the wall from behind from ahead it doesnt matter
3212210 he was just a part of it and we were a part of it whether he wins eight gold medals or not it wasnt going to be our responsibility for that to happen
3212211 just trying to enjoy 100 percent the experience and later try my best on court
3212212 i feel really good about the match not a lot of unforced errors no service breaks
3212213 i did the right things to come out on top
3212214 its a great thing going out there playing for your country
3212215 i had a lot of opportunities i didnt convert so that was tough
3212216 but i was winning the serves without problems he had more problems than me when he was serving so that gave me confidence
3212217 its just a matter of losing some matches where i feel like i shouldnt have lost
3212218 and then sometimes it plays a trick in your mind where you think maybe youre not playing that well actually but its actually not the case so its a matter of keeping yourself in a positive mindset

3212237 creepy strangers and how to deal with their unwanted attention
3212238 most problems in our lives go back to a false idea of who god is

3212244 los j venes dicen no quiero tener que ver nada con gobierno
3212245 dos de cada 10 j venes que inician primaria concluyen su educaci n superior en el pa s se necesitan demandas regionales de parte del gobierno federal ha emprendido una redefinici n de los planes de estudio para que haya vocaciones regionales con t cnicos y universitarios que se requieran en la vida productiva del pa s en su estado
3212246 los j venes dicen no quiero tener que ver nada con gobierno y hay que sacar a votar los j venes cada tres a os porque se sienten que no son tomados en cuenta
3212247 hemos estado haciendo sondeos e investigaciones y nos hemos dado cuenta que el principal problema que detectamos es el tema de las adolescentes que se embarazan entre los 14 a 17 a os aunado a eso es el tema de adicciones
3212248 se habl sobre varios temas que son de inter s general como la iniciativa popular contra el aborto o las pr ximas elecciones pero no se estableci ning n acuerdo o formalidad
3212249 de los candidatos contemplados hubo una participaci n casi de 94 por ciento incluida coahuila si no tom ramos en consideraci n el caso de coahuila llegar amos a una participaci n de 99 por ciento presentaron el examen 76 mil 578 aspirantes

3212252 you know back 15 20 years ago when they didnt have air conditioning
3212253 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3212254 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3212255 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3212256 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3212257 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3212258 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3212259 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3212260 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3212261 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3212262 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap
3212263 fairly or not folks think hes pretty liberal and nobody wants a pair of pelosis running things
3212264 the countrys still pretty divided people may want a divided government they want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans
3212265 not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3212266 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3212267 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient
3212268 an ever changing work in progress as authentic as a pair of designer jeans
3212269 its the thing that nobody wants to talk about but its obviously a huge factor
3212270 this is a daunting task as the first black candidate for president
3212271 to get there hes got to win roughly the same proportion of democrats and democratic leaning independents that all other democrats get if he doesnt hes in a world of trouble he cant win it just by changing the electorate
3212272 no sooner ditch his paster of 22 years than he could abandon the black community
3212273 over the next several months well see a reduction of about 13 percent in the total number of seats flying out of san jose
3212274 well probably be losing about 7 or 8 million in projected revenue for this new fiscal year that were in

3212282 the research has identified however that victim safety may be compromised by some processes at these courts
3212283 these may be conveying the impression that family violence is not serious replacing charges with ones which are less serious may also risk creating the wrong impression
3212284 on the basis of one year reconviction rates the introduction of the waitakere fvc has not had any significant effect on family violence reconvictions the overall family violence reconviction rate rose by 4 percentage points after the fvc was established in manukau
3212285 the waitakere fvc has not been entirely successful in its aim to fast track delays were reduced initially at manukau but this had not been sustained
3212286 the evaluation indicates that progress is being made with courts that are dedicated to dealing with problems involving family violence while acknowledging the courts effectiveness can be increased by further appropriate resources and support programmes
3212287 the family violence courts are working well but it should not be assumed that a court process alone will ever solve a significant problem involving crime

3212310 its very hard for us to lecture others about their economies when we have doubled the national debt during one presidential term or during the administration of a single president
3212311 we have a president who chortled about the fact that he has not left the country before he was president

3212313 it was so painful to leave tbilisi this morning somehow i cried so hard and didnt even know exactly why
3212314 i have a young son and i just want to get him out of harms way
3212315 i was planning to stay but when i woke up last night to the sound of bombs falling well that made the decision for me
3212316 ive got a group of students that i need to get to safety
3212317 there was a domestic argument between the mother and father
3212318 he got upset and struck the mother in the face one or two times on the left cheek which caused some bruising from what im told he hit her with a closed fist
3212319 the mother called police shortly before 3 a m and mr panettiere was taken into custody
3212320 hes been cooperative earlier they were at a party and the husband apparently felt disrespected by his wife
3212321 i can confirm that alcohol was involved in the incident
3212322 i think sometime in august i hope to come to a conclusion on what im going to do if im going to play or not this year
3212323 mats sundin may hab been showing flashes of brilliance on the golf course in his native sweden but the veteran centre showed no signs of making a decision on his playing future in the national hockey league
3212324 i think sometime in august i hope to come to a conclusion on what im going to do if im going to play or not this year
3212325 i know there hab been talk about first of august but i never said i hab said sometime in august hopefully ill be able to make a decision i wont make that until i really feel comfortable with making a good decision
3212326 im just trying to bring my mind to a point where i can make a good decision whether or not im going to play hockey right now thats my first decision and well go from there after that
3212327 senator obama please vote no on telecom immunity get fisa right
3212328 the internet gives young people the opportunity to hold me accountable when im not following through on promises that ive made
3212329 i am proud to stand with senator dodd senator feingold and a grassroots movement of americans who are refusing to let president bush put protections for special interests ahead of our security and our liberty
3212330 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
3212331 this reflects a very big change in expectations in domestic money markets from the rba
3212332 and commodity prices moving lower that removes a relative support for the aussie
3212333 economic growth will be fairly slow in the period ahead
3212334 fellow countrymen we have before us an enemy of great military knowledge trained soldiers and plated armor
3212335 such great knowledge that stretched hides and burning oil sent them scurrying in fear
3212336 such training that they were unarmed and asleep in the middle of the night
3212337 friends we have shown this tyrant that he can no longer take our money our crops our families not without a fight
3212338 today we fight a heartless and army less king who taxes us no more who enslaves us no more who will rule us no more
3212339 today we will march upon them alongside marduke we will finish off the kings men the kings fortress and we will win

3212343 as the discussion continued they all decided to give the names of their products unintelligible names so people really wouldnt know what their consuming and they would keep them hypnotized by giving them free wi fi they called their franchise starbucks
3212344 we would have to achieve a truce and we would have to deal with the same parties as before

3212359 i applaud senator orie for receiving this great honor and pennsylvanians could not ask for a more effective leader fighting to ensure that our commonwealth has a voice in shaping our partys platform

3212371 we scored early in the olympic qualifying tournament final against india in chile in april and today felt a bit like that
3212372 it certainly helped ease the nerves because we were nervous to say the least
3212373 we are in a tough pool and have to win every game so i am definitely happy to win this one
3212374 it felt nice to hit a few goals i think probably the main thing is starting off well coming into a tournament

3212395 it would be very very nice to see the prime minster come to china but i dont want to get the cart ahead of the horse one thing at a time
3212396 could he possibly be here for closing ceremonies i cant comment on that i dont know
3212397 we need to have closer ties to countries like china and certainly by being at the closing ceremony that might help
3212398 people keep saying that its not a political event so the prime ministers view is why would a political leader go to a non political event
3212399 the prime minister has been clear we will never sacrifice human rights for the almighty dollar
3212400 the way to be a master of rps is to declare yourself as one and then act like one
3212401 if we want to fix this in something less than a three year time horizon which i hope we want to do it has to be done in the very near term

3212405 oh my god oh my god that was an awesome race just awesome
3212406 i was definitely the most nervous because im his mother and a mother is always nervous before the races i am never calm i love him more and more

3212408 what makes me so proud is the honor she brings to the country and the people

3212410 it was a big deal and i have a lot of respect for what they went through and what they achieved
3212411 some of the athletes know who they are and what they did
3212412 im 26 and just about know what they did though there are a lot of athletes younger than me who are still getting to know of the huge steps they took
3212413 theyve smith and carlos have been around the penn relays and last years athlete of the year awards so their faces are getting known now
3212414 you dont want to offend people or rile them whether voicing political or social points of view
3212415 as regards the athletes we have a rule 51 where athletes cannot make political religious or commercial propaganda or demonstrations
3212416 they have to respect the countrys laws and there must be none in the stadia or the podium they can express their views in the mixed zone but not propaganda
3212417 they the athletes will have the right to be heard and then we will see what action has to be taken
3212418 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3212419 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3212420 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3212421 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3212422 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3212423 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3212424 ive never celebrated that much after a race in my life

3212431 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3212432 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3212439 its an exploration to see if our fans and our future fans want us in that stadium
3212440 it needs to grow bmo field has only 20 000 seats so thats a project in itself but first things first lets make sure our fans want to move before we even talk about moving
3212441 its a soccer specific stadium thats how it was built and thats what it was intended for
3212442 the soccer experience is whats paramount there and cant be hampered by anything the seats have to stay where they are when it comes to soccer with seats close to the field and there cant be any other lines on the field football brings with it a whole other set of lines
3212443 thats a great question that would need to be answered in short order
3212444 how serious the argos are we dont know if theyre surveying their season ticket holders that would suggest theyre pretty serious but there are certain things about the stadium that are pretty important to maintain
3212445 candidly we like being in a soccer specific stadium and would worry about any changes that would affect the soccerness the intimacy and the sightlines
3212446 but to speculate what our position would be is premature
3212447 basically mlse needs to co operate because the city gave them a lot of power over that stadium even though government paid for most of it
3212448 their power could determine if we go there if its not a great financial situation it doesnt matter how great the atmosphere is maybe the mayor will step in and make some things happen

3212459 the task force has made it clear it wants to charge ahead without any real clarity as to what its doing
3212460 i think there are people who would like to frame it that way the irony of some voices is that they hate tysons they think its dysfunctional they think its congested and crowded and they dont want to change a thing and thats just not tenable

3212462 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3212463 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as

3212465 there is a tiny cell component that is unique to germ cells the precursors to egg and sperm called nuage which means cloud in french other researchers recently suspected that nuage was involved in keeping genes from jumping around in germ cells of the female fruit fly
3212466 but until this mouse study no one knew for sure if it was involved in mammalian germ cells to test if the mouse nuage played a similar role in mammals we focused on a mouse protein called maelstrom whose distant relative protein in the fruit fly was implicated in the other study
3212467 we found that without the gene the process of meiosis was severely impaired
3212468 there was a profound defect in interactions of parental chromosomes a process known as synapsis leading to death of germ cells this was clear evidence that the protein is vital to the formation of sperm
3212469 we observed massive flooding of the cytoplasm and nuclei of germ cells by transposons in the mutant mice
3212470 this was the first time such a phenomenon was observed in germ cells of any species
3212471 since the jumping genes are not silenced just once during the development of the fetus but every time new sperm are produced during a mouse life its possible that germ cells may employ transposons in some fundamental way in male germline meiosis this research is the first such clue of that possibility we will be very busy over the next few years trying to crack this and other puzzles of maelstroms role in controlling meiosis and sperm production

3212492 1 ibu memberi hadiah surat al fatihah pada putra ibu di setiap sholat lima waktu 2 doakan dengan menggunakan asmaul husna 3 selalu komunikasi perkembangan putra ibu dengan kami 4 ikhlaskan dalam pembinaan ini 5 ibu harus memilih dua target yang memiliki hasil berbeda mengedepankan prestasi akademik atau membina akhlaknya terlebih dahulu
3212493 ustadz sekali lagi saya mohon ikhlasannya untuk membimbing putra kami mohon putra kami tidak dikeluarkan dari sekolah ini
3212494 mohon pertimbangan jika alternatif bimbingan secara halus sudah tidak mempan kebijaksanaanku anak tersebut dikeluarkan saja
3212495 udah kita tanya baik baik semua kesalahannya udah menulis daftar pelanggarannya sanksinya kita mulai anak tersebut kita bimbing bertaubat berpuasa isolasi dari komunitas lainnya dan kita komunikasikan ke orang tuanya
3212496 semua terapi tersebut tidak mempan bahkan selalu mencari kesempatan untuk mengulang segala pelanggarannya yang terpikirkan dan kekwatiran kita prilaku buruknya akan menulari komunitas yang telah kita jaga ini
3212497 alhamdulillah berarti yang harus di dalami adalah data tentang anak tersebut ayo temukan data anak tersebut kita tidak putuskan untuk dikeluarkan atau dikembalikan ke orang tua dalam batas waktu tertentu tidak tetapi kita akan mendampingi lagi
3212498 dont scare the shit out of the audience with military force

3212501 a release from a front giant to a front somersault and re grasp on the same side of the bar
3212502 sometimes tasering is going to save someones life as opposed to killing someone
3212503 what we dont want to do is put our police in a situation that the only resort that they have is a gun
3212504 any further use of force options that may be available to our police officers rather than having to use our service revolver in principle we support any devices or any training that will enhance and lessen the risks to the suspects that were confronting
3212505 so initially obviously the sapc would have preferred that we would have had an expanded deployment of tasers to frontline personnel insuring that there were appropriate levels of training and reporting and accountability measures built into the policies that may have been contemplated however the saskatchewan police commission has concluded that at this time theyre not in favour of further deployment of the ceds we certainly respect the commissions decision
3212506 in some cases unfortunately it was as a result of mental issues with the individual
3212507 in other cases it was because they were under the influence of narcotics that put them in this state im hoping that we can investigate this even further to make sure that the right decision at the end is going to be made

3212510 achei que desta vez era o fim mas n o era uma overdose era s vinagre perdi toda a resist ncia e meu corpo n o me obedecia mais foi assim que os outros morreram muitas vezes depois de uma picada eles perdiam a consci ncia e um dia eles n o acordavam mais n o sei mas por que tive tanto medo de morrer de morrer s os drogados morrem sos mais freq entemente em banheiros fedorentos tive ent o uma verdadeira vontade de morrer no fundo n o esperava por outra coisa n o sabia o que estava fazendo no mundo antes eu tamb m n o sabia muito bem mas um viciado vive para que para se destruir e destruir aos outros pensei naquela tarde que seria melhor que eu tivesse morrido mesmo que fosse s pelo amor a minha m e de qualquer forma n o sabia mais se existia ou n o
3212511 there is extreme danger from unstable ground and the possibility of falling trees there is also the possibility of sewage contamination within the area
3212512 there is still enormous room for improvement and nobody should think we are not cognizant of that
3212513 the fact that they didnt do it in exactly four years to me is immaterial
3212514 thats just getting kids over the line to get a local diploma
3212515 no one believes that those kids are prepared for college or careers
3212516 if that chart isnt enough to get them to approve it
3212517 then the parents of the kids who are still in school ought to go man the barricades

3212519 frankly speaking the way its dropping i think 800 will be taken out very soon
3212520 just look at the rise in the dollar and plunge in the euro golds decline is quite justifiable
3212521 if we want to fix this in something less than a three year time horizon which i hope we want to do it has to be done in the very near term
3212522 each day that passes takes us further and further away from the preparedness to compromise that was certainly evident in that last week of july for much of the time
3212523 ambassador schwab will continue consulting with other trade ministers who demonstrated their commitment in geneva to a successful outcome to the doha round
3212524 the u s remains committed to a successful doha round however we continue to have deep concerns with proposals under consideration that would not only limit market opening by the worlds fastest growing economies but would actually raise new barriers to trade particularly against other developing countries

3212526 the nearest i flew to the boundary when we werent spreading was 220m and the nearest we flew to the boundary when we were spreading was 140m and the bait was found 15 to 20 metres from the other side of the boundary as far as were concerned its not the helicopter
3212527 unless the bait can walk someone must have moved it

3212534 the research has identified however that victim safety may be compromised by some processes at these courts
3212535 these may be conveying the impression that family violence is not serious replacing charges with ones which are less serious may also risk creating the wrong impression
3212536 on the basis of one year reconviction rates the introduction of the waitakere fvc has not had any significant effect on family violence reconvictions the overall family violence reconviction rate rose by 4 percentage points after the fvc was established in manukau
3212537 the waitakere fvc has not been entirely successful in its aim to fast track delays were reduced initially at manukau but this had not been sustained
3212538 the evaluation indicates that progress is being made with courts that are dedicated to dealing with problems involving family violence while acknowledging the courts effectiveness can be increased by further appropriate resources and support programmes
3212539 the family violence courts are working well but it should not be assumed that a court process alone will ever solve a significant problem involving crime
3212540 the initial concept for prey b arf had been incubating for a while waiting for the right opportunity to come along
3212541 we jumped at the chance to create this game with a talented developer like human head studios wait i thought i was doing this on my own and next generation technology like the doom 3 engine game maker 7
3212542 prey is special for many reasons including several new and original gameplay features and a tightly integrated story that packs an emotional punch unlike other first person shooters
3212543 with their help prey is sure to breathe new life into the first person shooter genre with a compelling story innovative gameplay mechanics and dazzling imagery which is powered by our significantly enhanced version of id softwares original doom 3 engine

3212629 the blog note all your experiences good bad mood and beautiful sad memory
3212630 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3212631 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3212632 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3212633 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3212634 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3212635 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3212638 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3212639 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3212640 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3212641 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3212642 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3212643 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3212644 who are open to doing something on the production side
3212645 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3212646 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3212647 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3212648 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3212649 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3212650 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3212651 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3212652 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3212653 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3212654 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3212655 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3212656 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3212657 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3212658 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3212659 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3212660 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3212661 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3212662 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3212663 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3212664 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3212665 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3212666 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3212667 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3212668 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3212669 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3212670 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3212671 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3212672 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3212673 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3212674 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3212675 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3212676 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3212677 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3212678 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3212679 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3212680 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

3212684 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3212685 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3212686 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3212687 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3212688 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3212689 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3212690 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3212691 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3212692 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3212693 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3212694 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3212695 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3212696 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

3212766 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3212767 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3212768 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3212769 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3212770 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3212771 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3212772 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3212773 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3212774 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3212775 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3212776 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3212777 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3212778 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3212779 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3212840 actually for a problem like burma which seems so complex the solution can be surprisingly simple if only governments and the united nations stopped talking so much and started doing more
3212841 what we are seeing in burma today is a totally avoidable man made disaster caused by a particularly nasty regime but this regime survives only because it is propped up by aseans impotence chinas money and indias weapons
3212842 when you see villages marked for relocation state sanctioned mass murder gang rapes disappearances and torture you have a moral obligation not to engage that government in business
3212843 many burmese groups working underground and under dangerous conditions are changing the way people think they are teaching people about their rights what to expect from a government about democracy economics security they are working to empower them
3212844 many very brave people including youths and women are learning and then sharing this information in towns and remote areas all around the country
3212845 thats a key part to changing burma i feel ultimately it has to come from within i feel hopeful for burma because when and not if democracy comes the people will be ready

3212852 you could really get into a groove and thats a really important thing but at the same time sometimes things can get a little stagnant and stale i almost think im liking this new situation where we only get together four or five days before a tour everything is so fresh and were so excited to play with each other and i think it really shows
3212853 theres connections i can feel and ultimately i just go with my gut on it

3212856 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime

3212861 there are no easy answers but the school was just handling it on the hoof
3212862 there was no attempt to plan anything the school was totally unprepared for dealing with a kid like lauren
3212863 we were dealing with things that we could not possibly ever have expected who teaches you how to deal with a 13 year old who wants to be a girl but is having erections in class we were dealing with each incident as it came up but perhaps we should have tackled it as a school
3212864 schools think it is so rare that they dont take it seriously but when a trans child comes into a school the effect can be seismic
3212865 we had nothing to help us but when lauren had been at school for a while we began getting calls from teachers at other school asking for advice with similar situations
3212866 in terms of school it was a wonderfully positive experience beckys life apart from school at the time was terrible and she was in utter despair if school had not dealt with her kindly and been accepting it would have been the last straw and she would have ended it all
3212867 individual schools now could choose not to educate a child not to allow them to sing in a choir or to go on a school trip
3212868 the only protection for kids will be under education law protecting the right to education as such but not the nature of it
3212869 all children have the right to be educated in a fair and tolerant environment free from bullying
3212870 at the moment a very vulnerable group of young people are not adequately protected by the law

3212892 some of the community are going to find that difficult
3212893 these are jobs that wont get done otherwise and that just holds the economy back
3212894 they understand why its so important for us all to work together

3212898 it is a bunch of these terrific actors getting together and having a good time its that kind of thing
3212899 we have consistently stressed to people that they should take care they must be aware of the roads
3212900 weve got some of the worst roads in the country and its about money
3212901 its bad workmanship and bad supervision on the part of marlborough roads its about money theyre doing a bad job with cheap materials they should be compacting the whole lot instead of just the top
3212902 it was a blow its an absolute bloody tragedy there wont be any players left here its the wrong decision

3212929 the original crooked jades were around for 10 years and we had rehearsal every week
3212930 you could really get into a groove and thats a really important thing but at the same time sometimes things can get a little stagnant and stale i almost think im liking this new situation where we only get together four or five days before a tour everything is so fresh and were so excited to play with each other and i think it really shows
3212931 theres connections i can feel and ultimately i just go with my gut on it
3212932 i just try not to make a big deal out of it
3212933 what do i want to get out of this what do i want to accomplish here
3212934 if a man thinks hell die tomorrow hell probably find a way to make it happen
3212935 we got a lot of places weve got to hit but were going to be back here
3212936 this is a great town great sports fans its been a really good experience
3212937 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style
3212938 because there are no public drinking laws tailgating in the u s is a very individual experience you clear out your beer and your food from the fridge put it in your car pop the trunk and go at it
3212939 we cant do that here and we look at that as an advantage we want to take tailgating from an individual experience to a communal one
3212940 the interesting thing is that as nfl canada sponsors technically they dont need to step up to another level of sponsorship

3212952 our show is just like you a shameless spectacle its not just your fundamentalist hate addiction that fascinates me theres something more
3212953 youre not the type of conservative who hates fags but hides behind slick rhetoric about the sanctity of marriage and family values
3212954 no you are the real deal a balls to the wall lunatic spitting bile with all the conviction and dedication of a man possessed and theres a part of me that can respect that
3212955 i think this a la carte method of squeezing travelers is basically bait and switch
3212956 they bait us with a base fare and then start packing on the fees
3212957 making the hop to hoboken twice what we were told
3212958 the airlines have been very clear in publicly communicating their rates and charges
3212959 in addition the introduction of service fees has been the subject of many media stories which has increased even more customer awareness
3212960 have the authority to determine what an airline can charge for its services
3212961 airlines and ticket agents are unbundling specific fees from their advertised airfares and we will continue to monitor the industry to ensure these fees are clearly advertised and disclosed to passengers
3212962 on average it costs us airways 700 per round trip to carry a passenger
3212963 if i now said my day rate just paid for my infrastructure and my client had to pay extra for my advice that would be ludicrous
3212964 give me the price of the ticket let me make an informed decision and dont anger me by nickel and diming me on every bloody charge
3212965 we drive and go completely on feeling instinct chasing down what we call a person signature

3212980 the federal governments now looking at an inquiry to see whether pensions should go up but its really a stalling tactic
3212981 the need for pensioners to get an increase is dire and its now and it ought to be given to pensioners before christmas
3212982 for us its a milestone and opens a window to the past
3212983 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3212984 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as climate change
3212985 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3212986 we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3212987 whatever it takes to improve the performance of our team
3212988 brown has an international reputation for his fine style a style he here turns on to illuminate the cult of the saints
3212989 it is with great pleasure that i present the biggest net quarterly profit in the history of the company
3212990 household purchasing power is declining mainly due to rising consumer prices
3212991 exports the driver of above trend growth in the past three quarters have turned lower and external demand may make a negative contribution to growth
3212992 the economy does appear to have entered a cyclical downswing reflecting the sharp deterioration in the terms of trade and slowing global demand
3212993 the economy has eliminated excesses built up in the aftermath of the late 1980s bubble and the fundamentals of the economy are much better than in the previous post bubble cycles
3212994 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3212995 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3212996 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3212997 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of
3212998 sure 90 of science fiction is crud thats because 90 of everything is crud

3213000 i want to be a pitcher or the manager of the team it doesnt matter to me
3213001 september 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the orion
3213002 its the unknown unknowns that we have to hedge against
3213003 having some number of months of schedule flexibility to meet our commitment in addition to having some number of months of cost dollars flexibility is key to keeping ourselves in a healthy posture
3213004 as we looked at the plan we had for september 2013 against the available dollars it became clear to us that we needed to adjust our schedules
3213005 since 1884 weve had a roll call vote its a nominating convention not a coronation
3213006 i dont think theres any harm in nominating sen clinton at the convention
3213007 it will acknowledge the success we had and it will give an opportunity for people to express themselves and get behind obama and win in november
3213008 its a simple thing to do and its the biggest sign of party unity
3213009 if we do that one thing the hillary people can get past it and move on
3213010 if the situation were reserved the obama people would feel the same
3213011 for the first time in a generation its been a close election and this was such a unique situation
3213012 sen clinton is going to do everything she can to make sure sen obama is the next president and that will include how the convention is handled and the role she plays
3213013 polls out there show that older women are the potential swing demographic in this election
3213014 it helps obama and the party to have her play a prominent role in the convention
3213015 if a candidates got delegates then both names can be placed in nomination and the losing candidate in this case clinton
3213016 are these folks so new to politics are they so arrogant that they think hes different from every other nominee weve ever had
3213017 were democrats were precinct captains were fundraisers were the kind of democrats obama will need to win in november
3213018 the energy moves forward but the wave that carries the light moves backward
3213019 but if you have a strong brand and a strong product and you run an effective business you can ride through these tough times
3213020 it represents about 70 per cent of their the designers business by the time the collections are launched in store in about august and it follows through to the christmas period
3213021 its very very important for all of us to acknowledge that we local designers need support
3213022 one of the arguments against exercise is that it could be hard on my joints that i am going to become crippled in my old age and that my knees are going to have worn out and that is just not true
3213023 over the past 20 years weve seen the benefit of remaining active and running really does engage us to improve our overall wellness
3213024 the one race we all do at the same pace is aging but where we can be an olympian in life is to make sure you stay active and enjoy your longevity more
3213025 i enjoy the running because it allows me the ability to enjoy the fresh air clear my head and feel better physically emotionally and mentally
3213026 what i am saying is that you are never too old and you are never too sick to start running
3213027 even for those with couch potato status now you too can become an athlete if you approach it with intelligence
3213028 as long as you get your heart rate up several times during the week to where you are sweating it seems that will provide the benefits

3213109 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3213110 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3213111 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3213112 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3213113 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3213114 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3213115 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3213116 right now as a retailer who works downtown i dont feel i have any rights ive never experienced anything like this
3213117 i dont even leave the store to take a break at work
3213118 you never know whats going to happen when you go outside why on earth would people act that way
3213119 we have people making complaints about the number of homeless people
3213120 sometimes even when its just one person complaining they represent a lot of business
3213121 how many citations lead to some kind of legal challenge
3213122 its a pool of people being cited for whom generally officers know that they are homeless
3213123 there were a number of pieces that we were working to implement as part of the safe process meaning benches restrooms a day access center for the homeless along with the ordinance and we have been successful with one of them
3213124 i felt it was definitely profiling of the girl based on her being apparently homeless and of me because i was sitting with her
3213125 the general consensus of my group was the ordinance should be repealed
3213126 and for the following reasons people feel their rights are being abused that homeless people are being shoved across the river theres an element of where are we supposed to go people feel the ordinance has been unfairly enforced theres concern over the lack of enforcement against sidewalk cafes and sandwich boards the city did provide services but they are not enough and theres a sense that there are people who get out of control but that homeless people are being judged by others bad behavior
3213127 the ordinance could be repealed and an ordinance be enacted that specifically addresses aggressive panhandling
3213128 people tended to think things have not changed much since the ordinance was introduced
3213129 the womens crisis line said they have experienced a 200 increase in calls since last year because the number 1 reason for women being homeless is as a result of experiencing domestic violence
3213130 theres not enough resources out there to help people that are out on the street who are being targeted
3213131 people feel this law creates an us versus them atmosphere
3213132 they wonder what does safe really mean because it really means that the streets are now safe for people from beaverton
3213133 the idea is that the ordinance is counter to that that it represents the desire to make homeless people and social problems invisible
3213134 theres a concern that homeless people are being targeted and at the same time on the service side that we are not providing all the services homeless people need
3213135 they felt it ought to be repealed they also talked about the ordinances negative impact on the community that it increased tensions and that it wasnt bringing us together and was distracting us from a more cooperative approach to solving some of these problems
3213136 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3213137 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3213138 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3213139 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010

3213157 jadi selain mesti lulus tes kesehatan fisik lewat general check up juga mesti lulus tes kesehatan jiwa
3213158 yang terpenting yang melakukan tes ini adalah seorang psikiater rs pemerintah
3213159 kami hanya menanyakan untuk kepeluan apa yang nantinya kita cantumkan dalam surat lulus tes kesehatan jiwa itu kami tidak menanyakan detailnya seperti caleg daerah mana dan partai mana

3213245 it will strengthen our resolve to do it this time we have kept the basis of the team this season
3213246 okay we have lost gilberto who was very experienced and very important in the dressing room also we lost mathieu flamini and alex hleb but we brought in samir nasri and also we have many young players who are one year older and have learned a lot
3213247 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and now we want to continue we were a short way from winning the league and the champions league that is why we want to continue with the way we play and keep the belief

3213404 ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya kehidupan dunia itu hanyalah permainan dan suatu yang melalaikan perhiasan dan bermegah megah antara kamu serta berbangga bangga tentang banyaknya harta dan anak seperti hujan yang tanam tanamannya mengagumkan para petani kemudian tanaman itu menjadi kering dan kamu lihat warnanya kuning kemudian menjadi hancur dan di akhirat nanti ada azab yang keras dan ampunan dari allah serta keridhaan nya dan kehidupan dunia ini tidak lain hanyalah kesenangan yang menipu berlomba lombalah kamu kepada mendapatkan ampunan dari tuhanmu dan surga yang luasnya seluas langit dan bumi yang disediakan bagi orang orang yang beriman kepada allah dan rasul rasul nya itulah karunia allah diberikan nya kepada siapa yang dikehendaki nya dan allah mempunyai karunia yang besar tiada suatu bencanapun yang menimpa di bumi dan tidak pula pada dirimu sendiri melainkan telah tertulis dalam kitab lauh mahfuzh sebelum kami menciptakannya sesungguhnya yang demikian itu adalah mudah bagi allah kami jelaskan yang demikian itu supaya kamu jangan berduka cita terhadap apa yang luput dari kamu dan supaya kamu jangan terlalu gembira terhadap apa yang diberikan nya kepadamu dan allah tidak menyukai setiap orang yang sombong lagi membanggakan diri

3213406 zuhud terhadap dunia bukanlah mengharamkan yang halal dan membuang semua harta akan tetapi zuhud terhadap dunia adalah lebih menyakini apa yang ada di sisi allah ketimbang apa yang ada di tangan kita dan jika kita ditimpa musibah maka kita sangat berharap untuk mendapatkan pahala bahkan ketika musibah itu masih bersama kita kita pun berharap bisa menambah dan menyimpan pahalanya

3213424 countless numbers of patients labelled with the me cfs waste paper basket diagnosis have tested positive for severe mitochondrial dysfunction including my son this new research has profound implications for these patients and for so many others
3213425 some of my colleagues are calling it revolutionary we have shown that mitochondrial disease is not rare
3213426 what this says to me is that many more than 1 in 4 000 people have mitochondrial disease
3213427 and it tells me that 1 in 200 could develop some type of mitochondria related disease over the course of their lifetime depending in part on environmental triggers
3213428 the core of many well known diseases and chronic illnesses such as alzheimers disease parkinsons disease and autism spectrum disorders
3213429 mitochondrial dysfunction represents a major unexplored area of human biology of vital importance to human health
3213430 while it cannot yet be said that mitochondrial dysfunction causes these problems it is clear that mitochondria are involved because their function is measurably disturbed
3213431 mitochondrial dysfunction is a major underlying risk factor for human disease
3213432 we have always advocated spreading the immunizations out as much as possible because every time you vaccinate you are creating a challenge for the system

3213435 is there a relationship between mitochondrial disease and vaccination and mitochondrial disease and autism
3213436 would a vaccination or infection initiate an incipient mitochondrial disease as has been suggested
3213437 this will help us educate key members of congress to motivate and encourage nih to appropriate more funds to focus specifically on mitochondrial dysfunction and disease

3213522 the firm expectation of the swiss government that the philippine congress may soon enact the human rights compensation bill
3213523 as for our economic ties we acknowledge the important role of 60 swiss firms operating in the philippines and their contribution to our national development
3213524 forest history is actually the charting of the rise of complex societies
3213525 in contemporary times the notion of rebels as custodians of the forests is a very interesting one one could argue that one could encourage insurgency to preserve watersheds and forest cover there is a direct relationship evident between forests and rebels that would make us ask them to do that but i dont think we are going to do that
3213526 what it does suggest is that not all forests need to be touched if we can leave the forest alone for whatever reason we should be able to do that even when there is no intense insurgency
3213527 its easy to forget how ubiquitous a material wood was in the past given an age of plastic concrete and steel especially our age of plastic bags
3213528 one of the things that continually strike me is how old the arguments are about forest depletion in documents of the mid 19th century they were already complaining of erosion siltation drying of rivers all the kinds of things we think of as contemporary issues
3213529 i find that depressing this was over 150 years ago and apparently we havent made much progress since then

3213531 the attack was over in about 10 to 15 minutes we were not able to put up a fight for fear that many civilians might be caught in the crossfire there were also many students around because the town hall is near the school
3213532 the speech was interrupted several times by shouts of mabuhay ang npa coming from the rest of the rebels
3213533 this attack was an act of desperation of the terrorists to negate the success of military forces in our counterinsurgency they want to impress to the public that they are still a force to reckon with despite their losses in the battlefield and declining support from the masses

3213557 i understand that until i get back to pitching how i was im probably not going to see the late innings
3213558 when youve got a guy that has 37 scoreless innings i can understand that
3213559 hes done a fabulous job when you look and see what hes actually had to absorb on the run with no training the difference between the eighth inning and ninth inning is in your head few guys can handle it
3213560 even though you come to this level and have great stuff and great success theres always adjustments that have to be made really from outing to outing and sometimes season to season
3213561 now streets key is adjusting with the location of his fastball

3213819 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3213820 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3213821 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3213822 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3213823 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3213824 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3213825 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3213826 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3213844 you might think its different its not a big deal but thats the way i feel
3213845 i never accepted that i was just a pure dh
3213846 a dh is a guy that couldnt do anything else and im not that
3213847 i tried to play him in the outfield it didnt work
3213848 i just started converting on the big points much better
3213849 i missed a couple shots and he came up with a good shot and the next thing you know he won the second set
3213850 i was a little nervous out there to be honest with you
3213851 he made me play a set i wasnt happy with
3213852 thats the exciting part that im not really being held back by any of my injuries
3213853 i heard he misses it so he wanted to come stay in a dorm again
3213854 i told him id like him to come spend a couple days visit and have him visit with the team here one of these nights before we leave
3213855 the thing i learned having been through it is it takes the same things to go there and lose that it took to go there and win
3213856 getting there is so hard everybody works hard you have to find a way to work harder everybody works smart you have to find a way to work a little smarter then you have to be lucky
3213857 everyone has to do it his own way with his own philosophy
3213858 i told him so last year was a tough year but you can come out of a tough year better for having the experience everybody goes through that adversity
3213859 i made a mistake by leaving but i cant go back and change it i thought i was doing the right thing and i knew shortly after that i wasnt doing the right thing
3213860 when i watched her play i knew there were certain ways she liked to play and i tried not going to where she liked
3213861 the first day is always difficult said kirilenko who lost as an unseeded player to fourth seeded marion bartoli in 2004 her only other appearance in the tournament
3213862 i knew hsieh from juniors so i knew shed be difficult and i was having trouble with the tension on my strings they were too loose
3213863 last year i got to match point and morigami went to the finals
3213864 do not use soft wax as ear plugs or for any other function that involves insertion into a body cavity
3213865 at this point we are still trying to determine what led to the shooting
3213866 this is just senseless i mean we have to stop doing this to each other

3213868 saw what he believed to be tail lights of the truck in the distance it was apparent that the truck was driving away at a high rate of speed then lost sight of the vehicle a sheriffs spokeswoman said in a media report
3213869 as murphy came to the intersection of 653 and old bartow lake wales road he again saw the vehicle traveling at a high rate of speed and turned his emergency lights on to stop the truck
3213870 no creo que podamos aceptar este borrador franc s esperamos participar en la puesta a punto de un nuevo proyecto de resoluci n este lamentablemente ha sido preparado sin nosotros dijo el embajador ruso en la onu
3213871 esperamos participar en la puesta a punto de un nuevo proyecto de resoluci n este lamentablemente ha sido preparado sin nosotros
3213872 este texto fue presentado de forma prematura y faltan ciertos elementos no hay referencia a la agresi n georgiana
3213873 tenemos exigencias la retirada de los georgianos de osetia del sur el compromiso de no recurrir a la fuerza por parte de tiflis en osetia del sur o abjasia
3213874 rusia ha invadido un estado soberano vecino y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico elegido por su pueblo tal acci n es inaceptable en el siglo xxi
3213875 parecer a que estas acciones est n encaminadas a derrocar al gobierno georgiano leg timamente electo
3213876 estas acciones amenazan las relaciones con estados unidos y europa
3213877 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3213878 they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3213879 i looked at her and didnt even have the heart to tell her that i had to leave
3213880 so we finished the day out i took her home and explained it to her she could live with it
3213881 the good thing about this defense is its not loaded with stuff
3213882 even the first time i came out here to san francisco in march i was impressed
3213883 i was impressed with the coaching staff it reminded me of the coaching staff i had when i first got to buffalo out of free agency
3213884 we used to challenge each other in practice to see who could get the most picks
3213885 im definitely excited i feel that he can definitely contribute and help us as a team
3213886 but he deserves that hes actually playing the same position that i was when i came into cincinnati a lot of the calls are for willis side of the defense the weak side at the same time the ted has a lot of opportunities to make plays too if there is a play out there to be made im going to make it but ill tell him meet me at the ball
3213887 takeo is a great football player and a good addition to this team
3213888 it turns out well all be better for it hell push me ill push him if my role changes from defense to special teams then ill embrace that if defense is where im asked to play then ill embrace that as well
3213889 its always the speed limit when im on the field
3213890 right now weve got three guys that can win but all three of them are fighting for the job
3213891 because of the rotation that we have right now thats the way it is
3213892 in most cases and on most teams defense is always ahead of the offense
3213893 hourly teachers fee x classroom hours preparation hours materials administration overhead
3213894 the true nature of luck and how to make your own
3213895 i would seriously stab a hobo for a cigarette right now
3213896 i know how politics is i really dont think its going to matter either way
3213897 if he shows we have to go to trial this way we win

3213900 well there just really wasnt any room for career growth here i tried to stay but i didnt get any of the jobs i interviewed for so my only real option was to you know leave the plantation so you know its been a fun 8 years but uh i guess its time for me to peace out
3213901 barra de men s ten is que disculparme si hago mal las traducciones pero suelo utilizar los mac en ingl s y hay muchos nombres que no me los s p
3213902 if you had told me then what would have been the real winner for gaas ic technology the cell phone power amplifier it would have been the last thing that id have guessed
3213903 the standard deviation of pinch off voltage was enormous and if you wanted to make ics from the devices you would need a large voltage swing
3213904 we were able to drop the standard deviation of the pinch off voltages by a factor of 20 or more down to where they were comparable to silicon
3213905 because we were able to get decent ring oscillator speeds out of devices with power dissipations of 0 5 1 0 mw per gate
3213906 when we started the company we had a desperate need for funding and validation from customers
3213907 the pull behind the program was the need to develop more affordable weapon system front ends
3213908 it was going to take a substantial amount of money to get to a point where you really had the capability to produce these devices affordably in reasonable quantities and in high yield
3213909 you needed the ics for military applications but commercial applications served a very useful purpose
3213910 very quickly after that the prices dropped as chips became more available
3213911 then they started being used in wireless which of course is the principal application today
3213912 it really revolutionized the way people produce the front end of systems
3213913 i dont think youll find many modern systems that use hybrid technology anymore
3213914 i emphasized early on that people had to use manufacturing techniques that would result in an understanding of what were the yield inhibitors the critical parameters to be monitored and so on
3213915 they started realizing that you could produce the same circuits in a much smaller area of gaas
3213916 our program cant compete in terms of its size to the mimic program
3213917 but on the other hand weve had the benefit of an awful lot of infrastructure that didnt exist for the mimic program because we get the piggyback it doesnt require the same amount of resources
3213918 improvements in going from gaas to gan are not factors of 50 or even factors of two but an order of magnitude
3213919 i cant imagine why anyone would use gaas if gan was available reliable and cost effective
3213920 we could have gone directly to making devices or mmics but we would never have solved some of the fundamental problems
3213921 when we started you could literally watch a part on the bench degrade before your eyes
3213922 i think it will be a long time before a material really displaces gan i think that 20 30 years from now we will look at gaas as a transitional material that led us to better materials both in terms of bandgap and other things
3213923 i heard this noise it was almost like a rattle snake sound but not quite
3213924 there was such a flurry of motion that it was hard to tell what the heck was going on
3213925 there was a puncture mark in his torso and some white stuff oozing out he was clearly dead it was like really sad
3213926 ive never even seen a cicada here this may have been the only freakin cicada in the entire state of colorado and now its dead that totally sucks
3213927 the suspects are normally loving creatures who simply got a little carried away this sort of thing happens it was not premeditation or anything like that

3213930 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
3213931 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
3213932 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
3213933 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
3213934 the single most widespread american misunderstanding of prayer is that it is private when we privatize prayer we embezzle the common currency that belongs to all
3213935 solitude in prayer is not privacy privacy is getting away from others so that i dont have to bothered with them solitude is getting away from the crowd so that i can be instructed by the still small voice of god who is enthroned on the praises of the multitudes
3213936 we can no more have a private prayer than we can have a private language
3213937 if the self abdicates creativity and interaction with other selves whether god or neighbor it becomes flaccid and bloated
3213938 the best school for prayer continues to be the psalms it also turns out to be an immersion in politics
3213939 the word politics in common usage means what politicians do in matters of government and public affairs politics is smudged with greasy adjectives but the word cannot be abandoned just because it is dirtied it derives from the greek word
3213940 the people who warn that religion and politics dont mix certainly know what they are talking about all the same god says mix them it is both unbiblical and unreal to divide life into the activities of religion and politics but how do we get them together without putting one into the unscrupulous hands of the other prayer is the only means that is adequate for the great end of getting these polarities in dynamic relation
3213941 psalms 1 and 2 are an initiation into the responses that we make to the word of god personally blessed is the
3213942 all the psalms that follow range between these introductory poles evidence that there can be no division in the life of faith between the personal and the public between self and society contemporary american life though shows we love psalm 1 and ignore psalm 2 praying through psalms like psalm 2 breaks through the barrier of the ego and into the kingdom that christ is establishing
3213943 god does not save us so that we can cultivate private ecstasies we are made citizens in a kingdom that is a society he teaches us the language of the kingdom by providing the psalms
3213944 the unselfing of america is taking place all across the land bands of people meet together regularly to engage in the work disbanded they continue what they began in common assembled in acts of worship they pray dispersed they also pray much of the population profoundly ignorant of the forces that hold their lives together does not even know that these people exist
3213945 these people who pray know what most around them either dont know or choose to ignore they know that life confined to the self is a prison a joy killing neurosis producing disease fomenting prison
3213946 these citizens have unmasked the devils deception that prayer is a devotional exercise for pious people but that for people in the so called real world the way to get things done is by committee by machine or by a public relations campaign they have recognized the deep embracing reforming revolutionizing character of prayer it is essential work in shaping society and in forming the soul
3213947 prayer acts on the principle of the fulcrum the small point where great leverage is exercised at the conjunction of heaven and earth
3213948 prayer is a repair and a healing of the interconnections and pursues healing to its end settling for nothing less than the promised new heaven and new earth

3213954 in the situations i have witnessed there is no divine intervention all we have is each other we create our own problems and it us up to us to solve them
3213955 weve expected the incident to happen because the issue that was to be discussed is sensitive
3213956 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3213957 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3213958 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3213959 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3213960 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger

3213962 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
3213963 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
3213964 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
3213965 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
3213966 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
3213967 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
3213968 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3213969 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3213970 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3213971 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3213972 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3213973 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3213974 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3213975 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3213976 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3213977 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3213978 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3213979 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3213980 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3213981 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3213982 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3213983 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3213984 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3213985 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3213986 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3213987 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3213988 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3213989 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3213990 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3213991 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3213992 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3213993 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3213994 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3213995 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3213996 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3213997 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3213998 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3213999 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3214000 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3214001 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3214002 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3214003 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3214004 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3214005 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3214006 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3214007 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3214008 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3214009 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3214010 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3214011 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3214012 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3214013 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3214014 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3214015 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3214016 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3214017 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3214018 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3214019 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3214020 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3214021 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3214022 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3214023 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3214024 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3214025 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3214026 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3214027 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3214046 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
3214047 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3214048 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili

3214074 i hope they put some teeth into this by enforcing the license law and educating the public
3214075 people have to realize if their dogs get lost and they have a license tag they will get home if they dont have a license they probably wont
3214076 i think its just not practical to have our police department or parks people run around and try to give out tickets
3214077 this is one of those things that we just have to depend on the good will and the common sense of the public and hopefully theyll get the message
3214078 you can enforce the pooper scooper law but going into parks and assigning to check dogs for licenses just isnt something were likely to do
3214079 how many police officers are picking up and transporting animals not wearing a tag
3214080 i hope this exposure from the race today a kid can see this and say wow a black swimmer and hes got a gold medal
3214081 at first he was an average swimmer and he progressed
3214082 the more he progressed the better he got at it i never thought he would go this far im very proud of him
3214083 his mom would have to drag him out of the water
3214084 he was very highly motivated some kids just have that glow in him i just watched him grow
3214085 my parents always believed in the fact that whenever you leave the house youre representing the family
3214086 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
3214087 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
3214088 wed like to be real deep unfortunately it seems like it works that way at times where you just get hit in a spot right now it looks like thats the spot so well keep working through it and see what happens
3214089 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

3214091 if you can walk by a restaurant and see which credit cards it takes and whether zagat recommends them then you should also be able to see how the local health authority rates them
3214092 we wouldnt be spending millions of dollars to advance food safety training and certification programs for workers if we werent serious about food safety
3214093 restaurants only have the incentive to do what they need to do to stay open
3214094 the consumer would never know how close they were to being shut down
3214095 we have seen steady and material deceleration in googs organic revenue growth
3214096 the user should not need to provide explicit mode switch signals such as button presses arm relocations or stylus pickups before switching from one input activity to another
3214097 the first mission of a newspaper is to tell the truth as nearly as the truth can be ascertained
3214098 it is simply old fashioned and outdated to think that employees cannot and will not be productive if they are at a work site other than their office
3214099 if you did test hiv positive you were medically separated from the peace corps
3214100 based on personal knowledge of the currently serving peace corps staff members
3214101 our primary concern is that peace corps volunteers receive the best medical care and treatment possible
3214102 in the case of hiv the peace corps office of medical services has historically determined that the best testing evaluation and treatment for volunteers is available from specialists in the united states
3214103 the peace corps is now committed to extending the individualized assessments in these types of cases to include whether a newly infected volunteer could be reasonably accommodated and either kept at post or sent to another post in lieu of medical separation
3214104 in the face of a dwindling professional workforce we must act now to recruit the scientists engineers and other high level experts who make our government work
3214105 our initiative would mobilize the countrys colleges and universities to address this very acute challenge
3214106 provide resources like tuition assistance in order for these jobs to compete with the salaries available to top notch employees in the private sector
3214107 where their federal annuity presents no barrier to being paid full salary at the new job
3214108 the lack of standards and the elimination of opm approval
3214109 we offer our support to expeditiously conclude the process of reconciling house and senate passed versions of this vital good government legislation
3214110 have not acted to require or ensure effective coordination of the drug benefits
3214111 appear to be reaping a 200 million windfall annually paid for by the retirees and american taxpayers
3214112 it really hasnt been like being in the same job all the time because the job the organization and the congress has changed so much
3214113 it has been a lot of fun i have had great experiences and lots of opportunities to help see changes come about i have met and worked with great people
3214114 the most important thing for todays federal workers and federal retirees to do is recognize that they have got to involve themselves in the next several years to protect the benefits they now have
3214115 sifting down and will hit the public sector and when it hits the public sector it will hit the federal government first
3214116 this may not be the situation for our civilian folks who are injured or hurt
3214117 well the best experts in the world may be in the military treatment facilities to which you are not going to have access
3214118 and if we are not treating them in an adequate and equitable manner then that is part of the flaw that we have in our interagency process
3214119 they told me it was peace corps policy for hiv positive people to be medically separated
3214120 i was told i could not work anywhere else for the peace corps
3214121 it put a dark and depressing spin on my coming home which i didnt want
3214122 appears based upon a peace corps policy to terminate volunteers who are hiv positive without an individualized assessment as to whether they are able to serve with reasonable accommodation
3214123 the peace corps does not have a policy of automatically excluding people with hiv
3214124 the peace corps conducts individualized medical examinations of volunteers and applicants who are hiv positive
3214125 has not given us permission to speak about his individual situation
3214126 regardless of what they say their general policy is that is not what happened here
3214127 and i opted to have an hiv test done unfortunately it came back positive
3214128 the resolution of your condition s will take longer than the maximum allowable 45 days
3214129 you would be medically unable to perform your volunteer assignment
3214130 the only thing i want is the peace corps to respond to this letter change their policy to comply with federal anti discrimination laws or to clarify their policies so if they are in line with the law they stick with it
3214131 we do not want people who are seriously ill being put in the position of being subject to extreme costs
3214132 it is our responsibility and we do work very hard at it to make sure there is some limit to what folks have to pay in a serious illness
3214133 we stopped it before it had a chance to spin out of control
3214134 it seems to go against the philosophy of having a group plan with the risks spread out over all of the enrollees
3214135 are less likely to be financially self sufficient in retirement than their counterparts who do contribute
3214136 a government ill executed the decline of the federal service and how to reverse it
3214137 a feeble execution is but another phrase for a bad execution and a government ill executed whatever it may be in theory must be in practice a bad government
3214138 federal employees know they do not have enough capacity to do their jobs and are hungry for change
3214139 they also know the time for tinkering is long past
3214140 improving the hiring process will not suffice if new recruits do not have the opportunity to grow enhancing retention will not help if it produces more layers of management providing new resources will not matter if they are spread too thin and setting priorities will not generate clarity if appointees are not in office long enough to make the decisions stick
3214141 the ability to reenergize the federal service without inflicting great pain
3214142 thin government shift resources downward to the front lines where government services are delivered
3214143 decide what it should keep and what it should drop
3214144 the world has changed pretty dramatically so we wanted to do something that would put emphasis on rewarding superior performance
3214145 now there will be some concerns there always are concerns
3214146 but basically think of it as a merit based system that rewards high performers it has the flavor of the private sector in that you get superior performance one of the ways it is often described is that you get the behavior that you reward so that is the way we are thinking of this
3214147 there is confusion about the terminology and i think there is confusion about how the process works
3214148 by the same token management always has had a certain amount of flexibility on the bonus side how much do you put in and that hasnt changed i dont think people realized those were management decisions prior to nsps some people did but a lot didnt
3214149 any change is difficult and unfortunately many leaders still dont pay enough attention to that human side of the change process
3214150 it is not unusual to find some of them approach it as a one and done in other words we ran up to this we did the training we had to do we trained and we implemented and therefore it is and it is all done and i dont have to continue to pay a lot of attention
3214151 the exception but even if weve got a handful of them not paying attention it is problematic
3214152 has led the most significant transformation of the civil service in a generation
3214153 would i have liked to see more agencies brought in faster yes
3214154 has tremendous potential to revolutionize the future of data analysis for national security and other important applications
3214155 it is just a pause to determine how we go forward either with hewitt or with someone else
3214156 it is not a pause for the whole project it is only a pause for the calculation engine piece
3214157 we are working closely with opm to understand their rationale and respond to the notice
3214158 women and cats will do as they please and men and dogs should relax and get used to the idea
3214159 one of the things that we want the workers to know is that yes 2011 may be a few years away however lets start the planning process now lets start the conversations whether you know what you are going to do definitively or not
3214160 its a shock that is certainly true but we think it is a manageable shock
3214161 tells us that any winning candidate who has not started at least six months before the election will be woefully behind come the day after election day
3214162 we believe that the lack of compensation for unused sick leave at retirement has contributed to the higher amount of sick leave used by fers employees
3214163 we regard the tsp as the premier retirement savings program in the nation
3214164 but we also recognize that the law creating the tsp was enacted over 20 years ago and has been only infrequently updated the provisions in the discussion draft reflect ideas for modernizing and strengthening the tsp that we believe merit additional consideration
3214165 our position on roth is that we need to do some homework
3214166 within the hispanic and latino community there are some specific challenges
3214167 many people have never filed their taxes in the past so we help them prepare multiple years of taxes at a time we work with a lot of undocumented immigrants many of them do not have a valid tax id number and we work with them so the irs can choose an itin for them
3214168 they view the hispanic market as one of the largest growth areas and they are very interested in the solution were selling to drive efficiency
3214169 people like to have feedback on how things went very shortly after the ratings cycle
3214170 this is not rocket science to give all these people a copy of the agencys executive compensation plan their ses performance management plan and the summary data with regard to ratings bonus awards and pay adjustments why some agencies are doing a reasonably good job and others are not is a really interesting question
3214171 theres some set of folks that are leaving because it was not a good fit but you can also infer that there are some who are leaving because they were not effectively engaged by their employer
3214172 agencies need to adapt just as the private sector has to the culture of the next generation of federal workers
3214173 im not convinced it is necessary to subject applicants to this process
3214174 we are still working real hard with opm and the departments to try to figure out what the right number is
3214175 i believe we need to increase the hiring even more
3214176 we do everything from floor waxing to repairing vehicles to accounting to logistics operations to running grocery stores
3214177 about 3 billion more than germany spends on its entire defense budget
3214178 when you get to this level pretty much everything that walks through your door is going to be a problem
3214179 so what you have to have is a mind set to be a problem solver and figure out a corrective action plan
3214180 we look at our numbers and say were not doing too hot today or what are we doing about this problem that is emerging
3214181 it drives me a bit crazy when people say the departments books are all messed up and we dont know what the heck is going on
3214182 so at least we are trying to change the culture and we think weve made some good progress

3214189 omb is extremely concerned with the incidences of charge card abuse by federal employees highlighted in gaos report
3214190 overall omb believes misuse of the federal charge card is the exception rather than the rule and most federal employees are using government charge cards responsibly
3214191 stated that serious health and safety deficiencies exist in their workplace
3214192 most people talk about the retirement loss as a problem for the future and i would argue it is a problem of today we are already seeing that exodus of talent
3214193 more responsive to interactive communication and personal attention than people have realized
3214194 the potential for the new president and administration especially as we have the retirement wave getting under way to ask people not just millennials but older people as well to serve theres a sense that many would respond and step up as they did when john f kennedy asked
3214195 this is a great opportunity not only for people to celebrate public service but to come to the mall and learn about what is going on in the federal government
3214196 it will be a great excursion on the mall for kids and families from around the country
3214197 this bill is key to preserving the igs role as government watchdogs and making sure they can do their job of rooting out waste in this country
3214198 with the passage of sen mccaskills companion bill were one step closer to seeing this legislation signed into law im encouraged by the nearly unanimous votes in both chambers and look forward to working out a good compromise
3214199 the new conversion program in effect violates federal merit system principles that dictate fair implementation and execution of the hiring and promotion practices of federal agencies
3214200 you would think an agency with that many unhappy employees would talk to them
3214201 we need to do more than what we are doing
3214202 transitioning back into employment education and or training after completing military service can be challenging for some military personnel
3214203 are working together to review the data provided in the report interpret the data consider what implications the data may have on programs administered by our departments and determine what further research if any may be necessary
3214204 unfortunately we found that receiving the gi bill was not a strong predictor of successful employment outcomes such as high earnings responsibility in civilian work and placement in senior management
3214205 were not prepared to market themselves to the business environment they did not seem to understand the culture and expectations thus were not career ready
3214206 because we now believe irregularities may have occurred that could have compromised the overall fairness of the process
3214207 we believe this proposal will make the federal government more competitive in the employment marketplace by allowing employees the opportunity to enhance their financial protections whether due to planned maternity or due to unexpected illness or injury
3214208 darpa will take a chance on an idea with no data well put up the money to go get the data and see if the idea holds
3214209 that is the highest risk type of research you can have
3214210 putting a and b together and getting z taking obscure things and seeing there is an intersection there
3214211 working on something that should change the country and generate the economy shift that the internet did
3214212 the world will become a safer place people will be able to talk to one another and understand one another
3214213 we are extraordinarily broad if you can think of it were doing it
3214214 since then our agency has changed and our mission has been modified but the underlying reality has not
3214215 every day front line customs and border protection officers take up arms to protect our nation and this evening we salute all of them and pay homage to those officers who have died in the line of duty
3214216 ive had to make more phone calls than i would have liked
3214217 i want all of our students to have the ability to make public service their first choice after law school
3214218 so hhs has decided to move forward with the process of paying performance awards and step increases to all other employees while the negotiations continue
3214219 usually they are paid out earlier rather than later and this is later than usual
3214220 the department does not want to talk about this publicly
3214221 the makeup of the departments senior leadership must be reflective of the face of america
3214222 it was something that became a higher priority after i realized how serious a problem it was not just at gao but government wide
3214223 i learned a lot from the work and thinking that david had done
3214224 productivity alone cannot fully offset the increase in our workloads
3214225 to build clean wells in africa to support medical facilities caring for the sick to make a lasting impact in the fight against poverty injustice and oppression in africa
3214226 unfortunate that the president has not embraced congresss longstanding policy of pay parity for military and civilian employees
3214227 highly discouraged the president has chosen to abandon the principle of pay parity
3214228 my strong view that federal civilian employees should be equally recognized for their efforts
3214229 employees in security protective and law enforcement related organizations at the department receive the annual government wide pay increase and there is no reason to give tsa screeners less
3214230 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
3214231 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions

3214233 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children

3214237 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children

3214242 we also advise against all but essential travel to other areas of akwa ibom state because of the high risk of kidnapping armed robbery and other armed attacks it further said that if despite this advice you decide to travel to or remain in these areas you do so at your own risk there is a curfew in place in the okrika local government area rivers state 2200 0600 there is a high risk of kidnappings and other armed attacks in the niger delta to ships and oil rigs at sea off the coast of the delta since 2007 there has been an increase in attacks offshore there is also a risk of kidnapping in other states in south east nigeria
3214243 localised outbreaks of civil unrest can occur at short notice details and advice are circulated via the british high commissions community liaison officers network we strongly advise british nationals staying in nigeria for three months or more to register with the british high commission
3214244 the main type of incident for which british nationals required consular assistance in nigeria in 2007 were for attempts by scam artists to extract money over 600 cases replacing lost and stolen passports over 160 cases dealing with deaths most from natural causes 28 cases and kidnaps 11 cases violent crime is also prevalent in the south of the country including lagos
3214245 there is a general threat from terrorism in nigeria attacks could be indiscriminate including in places frequented by expatriates and foreign travellers outbreaks of avian influenza bird flu in nigeria have led to a small number of human fatalities the last fatality was in 2007
3214246 we strongly recommend that you obtain comprehensive travel and medical insurance before travelling you should check that your insurance company provides personal insurance cover for you in nigeria and that your policy covers you for all the activities you want to undertake

3214255 it aint what you dont know that gets you into trouble its what you know for sure that just aint so
3214256 it went largely unnoticed in the united states at the time that our government was essentially proposing that the u s pledge itself through nato to defend the small country by all means necessary despite georgias strategic isolation outstanding separatist issues and tense relations with russia
3214257 the current situation reveals two things how little the united states is able or willing to do in the region in the face of a determined show of force by russia and how such displays of friendship and support by the united states can lead smaller countries to unwisely poke the russian bear which is essentially what the georgian government did
3214258 the most the u s can and should do at this point is attempt to calm the situation through open and direct calls for a halt to russian advances while working through backchannels to encourage georgian authorities to accept a ceasefire that returns to the earlier status quo
3214259 the energy metabolism of tumor cells has long been known to differ from normal cells but to date no agents that attack these targets are in clinical use
3214260 in our laboratory tumor models and animal studies this new class of altered energy metabolism drugs produced remarkable anti cancer effects as well as very few adverse side effects
3214261 we are optimistic that fda approval of cpi 613 may mark an important step toward the establishment of a safer more effective way to treat a wide variety of cancer types and make a significant difference in the lives of cancer patients

3214263 security and significance are the two basic motivations at play in peoples lives and they often govern the preoccupations and decision making in the church
3214264 both are rooted in human nature but people choose which will trump
3214265 current analysis of church life cycles unveils how such motivations security and significance determine where a congregation is on the bell curve of incline recline or decline churches on the incline are characterized by risk taking evangelism and life transforming ministries churches in recline are focused on facilities programs and adequate finances to maintain a respectable viable congregation churches in decline prompted by a questionable future become obsessed with survival and preservation desperate for the tenuous security of hanging on to what they have
3214266 im disappointed with covenants lack of desire to do something new im starting to become disillusioned with this church as a result

3214275 i cannot see us accepting this draft of a resolution

3214278 i look at that tnt share price and said someone says were going to buy something that devalues our shares too at the same time
3214279 but we always look at different things and try to fit them into the puzzle

3214311 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
3214312 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
3214313 when you are training an elite athlete every aspect of their health and physical skills should be assessed and if possible improved it is natural to think of nutrition and weight training but traditional training is not enough anymore
3214314 scientific developments like the achievevision tm program developed by the vision care institute tm offer new techniques to help our athletes perform at their peak and allow coaches athletes and trainers to ensure vision is helping not hindering their performance the british olympic association has installed the achievevision tm program equipment at bisham abbey national sports centre with the support of visual performance skills consultant dr sherylle calder to allow eye care professionals coaches and trainers to customize vision care for each athlete
3214315 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in beijing
3214316 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives

3214369 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3214370 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3214371 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3214372 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3214373 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3214374 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3214375 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3214388 i think the biggest problem is not the young people its squarely the police
3214389 i think its important we have this sentiment of security and the only way we can have it is by being very transparent in the investigation that will be put forward by the minister of public security
3214390 i was very clear with him this morning that this has to be done as soon as possible and the information will be made public
3214391 were there to listen to understand what happened yesterday sunday night and to avoid these kinds of situations

3214422 jika pendakwaan mengatakan dna pada barang kemas itu milik mangsa bagaimana dna altantuya boleh ditemui pada jaket milik sirul azhar calitan untuk ujian itu diambil pada bahagian dalam jaket iaitu kawasan leher dan ketiak

3214522 the study proposes that increased efforts should be made to identify tb cases in hiv clinics hiv positive people and those living with them should regularly be screened for tb the study says the study authors also recommend that all hiv positive people who do not have tb receive the antibiotic isoniazid to help prevent tb infection physicians also should consider administering antiretroviral drugs to hiv positive people at earlier stages of the disease to reduce damage to the immune system and reduce the risk of tb
3214523 tuberculosis tb is the biggest killer of people living with hiv in africa but only one percent of hiv positive people accessing treatment were screened for tb in 2006 an oversight that activists say threatens to roll back the gains made in placing more than three million people on life prolonging anti retroviral arvs treatment world health organisation globally only about 314 400 people were screened for tb in 2006 26 percent of whom were found to have an active form of the disease hiv positive people are 50 times more likely than hiv negative people to develop tb and without proper treatment 90 percent of them usually die within months despite these statistics none of the three biggest aids donors the global fund to fight aids malaria and tb the united states presidents emergency plan for aids relief and the world bank have incorporated requirements for tb testing to be provided to people living with hiv in their programmes

3214582 growth figures for mid 2008 will be substantially weaker than for the first quarter of the year

3214629 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas
3214630 se ha instalado un contingente de carabineros al interior de predios forestales resguardando el patrimonio privado
3214631 al escuchar por las noches los frecuentes disparos que realizan los polic as en el camino p blico del sector el cual atraviesa las propias comunidades
3214632 esta violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales
3214633 hay un uso excesivo de la facultad de los fiscales que han ordenado el ingreso de funcionarios de fuerzas especiales y del grupo de operaciones especiales

3214635 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3214636 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3214637 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3214638 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3214639 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3214640 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3214641 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3214642 umbral de un verdadero golpe de estado contra el orden constitucional
3214643 al t pico estilo de las dictaduras que precedieron a la recuperaci n de la democracia en 1982
3214644 toman aeropuertos toman cortes departamentales electorales y balean carros coches de ministros
3214645 las fuerzas armadas son los garantes de la democracia concepto que incluye el precepto constitucional de garantizar la estabilidad del gobierno legalmente constituido sea el actual o cualquier otro que recoja la voluntad del pueblo que es el gran soberano
3214646 los resultados del proceso cualquiera que estos fueran con la mayor cordura y sentido de responsabilidad
3214647 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3214654 la pr ctica de los consejeros viola la ley ind gena 19 253 y los principios ticos al asumir posiciones vitalicias y patrimoniales sobre la conadi
3214655 nosotros queremos que el gobierno le d una soluci n a los problemas de tierra que tenemos en diferentes comunidades tambi n rechazamos la actuaci n de estos consejeros que est n imponiendo su derecho afirmando que el trabajo que ellos hacen es verdadero nosotros decimos que el gobierno est buscando un medio para buscar soluciones en estas comunidades
3214656 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
3214657 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
3214658 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
3214659 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos
3214660 el 11 de julio inform por oficio al ministro del interior de la gravedad de los hechos que est n ocurriendo en nuestra comuna y hasta la fecha no he recibido respuesta alguna percibo que est violencia puede hacernos perder el raciocinio y de ah las consecuencias pueden ser fatales por eso pido el m ximo de preocupaci n para resolver este problema
3214661 no queremos m s que la justicia militar resuelva los casos que involucre a la polic a y a los mapuche todos sabemos cual es el resultado al final siempre se protege a carabineros y los mapuche tienen que pagar como culpables eso es una deuda que el gobierno que la c mara de diputados tiene que cambiar no es posible que esto contin e

3214674 to discuss some current marketplace dynamics that will directly affect you in terms of increased prices for monsantos line of roundup herbicides for 2008
3214675 we have seen the demand for roundup brand herbicide increase more than our current ability to supply
3214676 we have a reliable supplier commitment to farmers who choose to purchase roundup ready technology and who choose to purchase roundup brand herbicide that we will have supply available
3214677 our competitive challenges have put our commitment at risk forcing us to increase our price for roundup herbicide
3214678 how much is their promise to me going to cost me
3214679 these are more and more not the movies i fell in love with and i wonder if people watching them ten years from now will even be seeing the same film i did or if greedo will forever be shooting first if peking opera blues will end with a long pause instead of title cards telling us the fate of the main characters and if tony leung will drink his coffee in silence
3214680 strong possibility of a further ecb rate rise in september or october

3214687 we the leaders of once captive nations of eastern europe and now eu and nato members estonia latvia lithuania and poland express a deep concern over the russian federations actions toward georgia
3214688 we will make adjustments to ensure sustained operations and dont anticipate their departure will result in any significant long term impact on the overall security situation in iraq
3214689 they were an important and valued partner and contributed quite a bit to the improved security in wassit province where the bulk of their forces operated with us and our iraqi security force partners
3214690 i do not think that the departure of the georgian soldiers will have an impact on the situation in the province
3214691 there were always language and poor performance problems our security forces can fill any vacuum
3214692 they did not try to give us services instead they were a source of annoyance by delaying us at their checkpoints and mocking the simple locals
3214693 we want to thank them for the great support theyve given the coalition and we wish them well
3214694 weve adapted quite frankly these were good soldiers but weve been able to adapt the battle space to account for their loss
3214695 in the long run it didnt make sense to keep the pool open and staff it if we only had one or two people in the water today

3214698 she didnt have what one would call a profession but i didnt know why she particularly wanted one it seemed like shed been infected by a very american idea of identity to think that who you were mostly consisted of what you did to get paid that seemed silly to me if i looked like rema if i had her ways and if i werent a man id consider it profession enough to have streaky bleached hair to wear a green scarf to spill spicy teas to walk slightly unevenly on high heels what more is there to give the world than that
3214699 we need to develop a better descriptive vocabulary for lying a taxonomy a way to distinguish the lies that the liar himself believes in a way to signal those lies that could more accurately be understood as dreams lies they make for a tidy little psychological doppler effect tell us more about a liar than an undistorted self report ever could

3214738 its something that well have to manage on our team at some point throughout the year but i think the fact that our players worked hard in the offseason are in pretty good condition weve improved the strength level we had all but two of our freshmen here for the entire summer all those things seem to contribute in a positive way maybe to being able to stay healthy

3214743 we use the mist to hide what distinguishes us not from shame but from fear of being branded as different

3214747 word that boeing is strongly considering a no bid position for the next round of the u s air force refueling tanker competition is spreading only two days after the pentagon released the revised kc x draft request for proposals rfp
3214748 after northrop grumman threatened a no bid position in the last round were there supposed to be multiple rounds i dont think so the pentagon added items to the rfp that would take into account the attributes of its a330 200 based design which was submitted jointly with eads

3214754 medicine clinical trials test potential of hallucinogenic drugs to help patients with terminal illnesses
3214755 i think theres a perception these compounds hold untapped potential to help us understand the human mind
3214756 the working hypothesis is that if psilocybin or lsd can occasion these experiences of great personal meaning and spiritual significance then it would allow patients with terminal illnesses hopefully to face their own demise completely differently to restructure some of the psychological angst that so often occurs concurrently with severe disease

3214758 investigators need to be confident that the volunteer could not exit the window if in a delusional state
3214759 the way i view it is we experienced some kind of broad cultural trauma back in the 60s and these drugs became demonised in that context
3214760 as a culture we just decided clinical research shouldnt be done with this class of compounds
3214761 this was partly the federal regulatory authorities it was partly the funding agencies and it was partly the academics themselves leary had so discredited a scientific approach to studying these compounds that anyone who expressed an interest in doing so was automatically discredited
3214762 these drugs these experiences are not for the mystic who wants to sit on the mountain top and meditate they are not for the counter culture rebel they are for everybody
3214763 as the session began and as it built up i felt this lump of emotions welling up and firming up almost like an entity i started to cry a little then it started to dissipate and i started to look at it differently and i think that is the beauty of being able to expand your consciousness i dont think the drug is the cause of these things i think it is a catalyst that allows you to release your own thoughts and feelings from some place that you have bound them to very tightly i began to realise that all of this negative fear and the guilt was such a hindrance to making the most of and enjoying the healthy time that im having however long it may be i was not utilising it to the best and enjoying my life because i was so afraid of what wasnt there yet these substances occur in our natural world and people have been using them for thousands of years to treat physical illness to treat social and behavioural problems

3214770 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3214771 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3214772 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3214773 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3214774 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3214775 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3214776 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3214777 we heard about that killing on the bus in canada
3214778 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3214792 people walk around with a tremendous misconception of what it means to be single singleness in its basic definition means to be separate unique and whole to be single means you are separate from everyone else and you are unique in yourself which means you recognize theres no one like you and you have worth within yourself to be single also means you are whole you dont depend on other people to make you somebody until a person is completely single in these three areas his or her relationships will always be a problem

3214801 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3214802 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as

3214804 i dont understand this is terrible for the poor people there they are nothing
3214805 we have no capacity whatsoever to intervene militarily what we ought to be doing is telling the russians that they have a lot to lose if they continue to pursue their own aggression
3214806 we are basically seeing the cold blooded preplanned premeditated murder of a small country
3214807 basically what my georgian friends are saying to me via email is they think the russians are on their way and theyre frightened
3214808 they want to be their own country do their own thing is that realistic with russia on their doorstep probably not
3214809 for us its a milestone and opens a window to the past

3214830 i really thought theres no way and then i changed and i said you know what that is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got a supercharge and took it from there

3214840 the younger generations of modern orthodox jews are seeking new meaning to their religious expression going beyond survival and anti assimilation and just text study
3214841 there have been countless individuals who have felt estranged from the orthodox community who have been in touch with us were getting hundreds of e mails saying that this has filled a gap
3214842 we will look at the draft and try to bring it to a standard where it can play a role in this
3214843 in the process of invasion occupation and annihilation of an independent democratic country
3214844 we have to go to the shelter because there are russian planes flying over the presidential palace here sorry
3214845 at the moment our troops are pushing out capturing and disarming groups of georgian law enforcement agencies which have been surrounded in the capital of south ossetia
3214846 inflicted damage on operational systems troops and military facilities of georgia
3214847 overnight as many as 50 russian bombers were reported operating simultaneously over georgia targeting civilian populations in cities and villages as well as radio and telecommunications sites
3214848 during their mop up operations in south ossetia georgian commandos have thrown hand grenades into the basements where civilians were hiding
3214849 we are basically seeing the cold blooded preplanned premeditated murder of a small country
3214850 we have to understand these russian troops didnt materialize out of no where
3214851 this is the culmination of putins efforts to pull georgia back within russias sphere and exert control over it
3214852 there is no question that georgia started this conflict with an offensive against the separatists of south ossetia because its entry to nato required a resolution to the problem but the disproportionate and continuing military attacks by russia appears to have united the european union and the u s in a call for the removal of russian troops
3214853 the fighting has now created a major refugee crisis that is spilling over to regional states
3214854 and a political crisis with fears that russia is trying to overthrow the democratically elected pro western government of georgia
3214855 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3214856 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3214857 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3214858 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3214859 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3214860 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3214861 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3214862 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3214863 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3214864 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3214865 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3214866 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3214867 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3214868 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3214869 i wish to extend my sincerest sympathies to bob leeks family its so easy to criticize but we should recognize the great work of everyone who responded to this devastating event
3214870 i was within 10km of the incident and it was truly terrifying even from a safe distance

3214874 thanks for the reply i guess were on our own
3214875 listen smartass your lack of knowledge on how rescue works is only surpassed by your lack of knowledge of animal husbandry we do this work on our own time and finance our endeavors with our own money just because you did not receive a reply in your time frame does not mean that we have to tolerate a sarcastic message we receive dozens of requests like yours every month almost all of the people who we try to help ignore our response to their inquiry or dump the dog after we have spent many hours trying to locate a loving home after your dog escaped numerous times and attacked another dog and its owner you finally decide to act did you figure the dog was going to train himself of course we know that sibes are escape artists especially when left unsupervised for many hours in a backyard ill bet we could find the escape route in seconds weve held their unconcious bodies after they were struck by a car and their owners walked away laughing when did max complete his first obedience class how much time do you spend daily working with him now that its a last resort situation youre in a hurry and you want total strangers to vet rehab and re home him asap and of course you expect us to do it at our own expense you harbor an uneutered dog who has brought 5 more dogs into this world and you thought that this wouldnt eventually happen and if you thought your story about your son leaving you folks with the responsibility for three sibes was going to garner our sympathy it didnt my folks raised me to respect myself them other people and especially animals they taught me self discipline and to live up to my responsibilities in fact i became involved in rescue because of the lessons they and other people taught me over the years i feel sorry for old max we see dozens of dogs like him in the course of our rescue endeavors they arent bad animals just unfortunate enough to have been chosen by the wrong humans and sadly they pay with their lives most of the time we probably could help max of course it would mean that we would have to find the funds to vet him the time to rehab him and the patience to find a home that will understand his bite history and of course we would have to extend ourselves beyond the call for folks who dont even bother to read our surrender procedures name address phone number no mystery people ron at tundra spirits

3214915 cowardice asks the question is it safe expediency asks the question is it politic vanity asks the question is it popular but conscience asks the question is it right and there comes a time when one must take a position that is neither safe nor politic nor popular but one must take it because ones conscience tells one that it is right
3214916 announcing your plans is a good way to hear god laugh
3214917 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3214918 i think it just goes to show just how bearish the market has turned
3214919 its like it was when prices went up it didnt seem to matter what bearish news came out the price just kept going up
3214920 what a waste of time another reality show that serves no purpose for society
3214921 you turn these fish and this bread into enough to feed all of these people

3214926 okay but if youre going to go into this kind of debt i dont want to know how much we owe because i have no control over it
3214927 if this is the wrong decision if you have something better in mind please intervene
3214928 laura i dont want to pry but we got a phone call this morning from someone who told us you were losing your house
3214929 the people who called want to offer you their vacant town home in northwest hills
3214930 the only thing is that theyd like to remain anonymous
3214931 surely ive hit the threshold of grace and god has bailed on me
3214932 modelling is a way for me to continue with my sport the hours are flexible and you can earn good money through photographic modelling and the catwalk
3214933 this is the best environment for volatility trading since the tech crash in 2000 and 2001
3214934 for shorter term ctas and some macro funds that are able to exploit the same market environment
3214935 with that type of economic news its extremely doubtful we will be shifting back to a period of lower volatility like we had from 2002 through 2006
3214936 instead it says to me that a higher risk premium is here to stay which is good for us
3214937 we see ourselves as liquidity providers to the options market and are trying to capture the premiums on the options rather than the markets actual direction we aim to be hedged and effectively market neutral so you might call us an insurance policy
3214938 asia can be particularly attractive because of the generally higher level of illiquidity you can find there that illiquidity can mean a higher premium and outsize returns
3214939 and if you scratch the surface you find most of the asian volatility portfolios are actually run from here in the u s
3214940 you cannot point to actual market turmoil and say that is why volatility funds are doing well default rates on corporate bonds are somewhere in the 2 5 range not at some outrageous level i think the real driver is hidden credit problems where you have trillions of dollars in bad debts being held by banks i dont think the story is so much about market volatility in general as it is about the high level of leverage in the markets
3214941 that could last for three years maybe and puts upward pricing pressure on options
3214942 and that helps funds like titan because it allows us to get the same return at a lower risk
3214943 the point is that if only a fraction of trades are profitable then you want to make sure you make two times three times or four times on those winners
3214944 its an important measure for a macro fund considering where we are i think there are some parallels between the internet bust of 2000 and the real estate and subprime situation we are going through after what happened with tech you had a series of bear market rallies where the indices would gain 10 or more in a single session before losing ground again its my opinion we might be seeing the same pattern now
3214945 jesse benton a spokesman for ron paul said that his boss does not plan to recommend supporters to champion barr
3214946 bob and ron are former colleagues and theyre friends but thats where the relationship ends
3214947 so whatdo you think will your moment be in life that you feel that stinking great
3214948 i dont know but right now im thinking i need to get me an oreo
3214949 there has been a flight to quality that has resulted in money flowing to proven hedge fund mangers
3214950 the rich are getting richer and startups have found a much tougher fundraising environment or have been more apt to take on seed capital consider giving up a minority stake or join platforms than they have been in preceding years
3214951 investors are cognizant that funds that launch with less than 100 million in assets are in jeopardy of not becoming a going concern
3214952 if you want to launch a hedge fund in todays environment you need to find some sort of strategic investor to get you to this aum threshold
3214953 its a different kind of environment than what we saw 18 months ago investors arent only looking at pedigree but at the stability of the platforms that theyre building which goes up dramatically when you have a big established name backing you
3214954 in dow kims case merrill was going to play that role for him but when the firm was no longer willing to do so thats when a lot of the wind fell out of his sail
3214955 just because you were senior at a sell side shop isnt enough anymore
3214956 people want to hire managers who have actually done it before and the most successful individuals are those who come from the buy side
3214957 theres a lot of competition to raise new funds giving investors a lot of choices where to deploy their capital
3214958 investors are favoring managers who already have some capital committed rather than those pursuing brand new efforts
3214959 the larger more established firms with lots of capital are in a good place to be able to attract and hire talent
3214960 from a seeders perspective they get competent investment management with optionality that can limit their downside for example if you seed 10 funds and one of them is very successful it can serve to pay for the others
3214961 and as the hedge fund industry has matured there are a lot more professionals with five and 10 years of experience looking to start their own funds and they tend to need seed capital
3214962 there has been a lot of interest in dislocation funds but most of the money being raised is in a drawdown structure so people are just committing to them but not much cash has flowed in yet
3214963 there is a lot of opportunity but theres going to be more and people are still just looking and poking around
3214964 we are big believers in closed end funds especially in markets such as distressed credit these longer term private equity like structures make a lot of sense in dislocated parts of the credit market where liquidity has evaporated
3214965 the key to the analysis is understanding where the fulcrum security is
3214966 if its in the middle of a finely tranched capital structure and your asset valuation is off by a few percentage points you can get wiped out thats not a lot of margin for error
3214967 there will be chances to buy for 10 and get 50
3214968 you can buy at 50 and have it worth zero
3214969 most managers dont want 40 of their assets in illiquid securities because that would create an asset liability imbalance for a vehicle that permits investors to redeem
3214970 when it comes time to cash checks coal is still king
3214971 if the american people want real action on energy they need to know whether their member of congress is working for them or their coal cash contributors we have better ways of producing energy than blowing the tops off mountains and destroying the climate and communities
3214972 after years of favoring republicans over two to one the switch in control of congress led the coal industry to shift its resources in this congress the top recipients are the subcommittee and committee chairs of the committees with jurisdiction over our energy and climate future and six of the top ten coal cash recipients are democrats king coal clearly knows how to win friends the question is what kind of influence will it lead to
3214973 i expect there will be more blips like this ahead but the fundamentals remain good for futures managers no one is predicting oil will see a sustained drop in price or even that agricultural markets like wheat or rice will give back all their dramatic gains
3214974 these are demand driven trends that are here to stay and for that reason we remain bullish
3214975 trades focused on the commodity currencies remained strong but april was overall a weaker month from a macro perspective
3214976 the u s interest rate move from 3 to 2 clearly affected ctas
3214977 though you have multiple trading systems in place managing risk is a matter of managing exposure
3214978 as a general rule you dont need a bull run in commodities for ctas to do well some of the best periods for ctas come with inflationary or recessionary fears because markets like interest rates and currencies tend to diverge during those periods giving trend followers something to work with
3214979 in my opinion ctas proved their worth and earned their performance fees in 2000 through 2002 in a way they have not in the last year or so far this year
3214980 the question of whether you did well lately in managed futures depends entirely on whether or not you traded agriculture and energy and if you traded contracts that were sensitive to interest rates and credit you couldnt lose betting on increases in energy and to a lesser degree agriculturals but with interest rates you probably lost
3214981 it was an unusual case in march and april in that you had a sudden u s interest rate move and in my opinion they got the libor number wrong
3214982 trend followers are vulnerable to such moves with the exception perhaps of very short term high frequency traders
3214983 since the second half of 2007 you had big trends that have continued
3214984 in addition to the commodity currencies hitting highs against the dollar in mid may you saw crude setting new records at 127 per barrel what differentiates ctas is their ability to manage risk on the downside its one thing to make money and its another to hold onto gains when momentum gives way to reversals
3214985 there is always the possibility that the saudis will decide to start selling more oil after all and that can be as much about political trends as it is about market trends
3214986 the persistent view is that we all own the same stocks
3214987 there are a lot of cubs so of course there is some overlap
3214988 if we own the same stocks its because we came to the same conclusions
3214989 there are some ex tiger guys that i talk to on a weekly basis and others every one to three months
3214990 theres respect among a lot of us its a benefit to be able to discuss ideas
3214991 generally you would need to prove they were working as a group with the intent to target a specific stock and manipulate its stock price however it could just be that people with the same training and background might have a similar way of looking at securities and inadvertently target the same stocks without any agreement to do so as a group
3214992 julian is such a choir boy hes a stickler for integrity
3214993 there is a collection of people thinking alike and what if it doesnt work out
3214994 it might inflate stocks because they own in aggregate a lot of the same stocks or push them down because they are all running for the door at the same time
3214995 if great managers came to the same conclusion by themselves great
3214996 is not a theme its our only internet search idea
3214997 people focus on 20 of the portfolio being the same but forget that theres another 80
3214998 the only one thats institutional and successful is lone pine
3214999 viking played the financials very well and credit markets with very astute cds exposure and nimbleness therein as markets and volatility moved tremendously
3215000 they were also helped by their credit card company exposure
3215001 we have a competitive advantage as we cover a lot of taiwanese companies that supply apple so we get a view of consumer demand for products and a sense if things accelerate or slow down
3215002 until the first half of 2007 it was a pretty difficult environment overall for many strategies because volatility was very low and markets were momentum driven which is not ideal for tigers
3215003 they were losing money on their short book until the market corrected a bit in 2007 and their shorts began to pay off
3215004 tigers tend not to swing their exposures so going into 2008 they had high exposure to short financials and long tech
3215005 then there was a huge reversal from quants deleveraging so apple google and rim really got killed
3215006 we got out early as we thought crude at 110 to 120 was all it had and we switched to natural gas so we missed the april rally
3215007 tigers dont look at growth momentum but at growth at a price
3215008 everyone is trying to buy a stock that has more value tomorrow we focus on end value
3215009 i can tell there are a lot of guys in emerging markets now i get a lot of calls from tiger guys
3215010 after talking with eric about the dire state of the world you want to down a whiskey and take a prozac
3215011 i can see how on a one time basis they might say that
3215012 our counter to that would be one that our business is already much larger than last year by a factor of probably at least 30 so our base fees are going up for sure and two even though people cant imagine that you can keep doing it we have a long record of continuing to do it
3215013 on traditional metrics the sprott issue appeared to have been priced close to perfection and didnt leave much room for error if the firm goes into a soft year for performance fees
3215014 but when you peel back the onion you can see their ability to generate performance fees over a long period of time compared with other canadian managers youre still paying for the name and historical track record but as long as you continue to have faith you can justify the valuation
3215015 uncertain world will realize we can continue to do that
3215016 i try to convince people not to think that way
3215017 we dont regard gold precious metals and energy assets as resources but as keys to survival in a secular bear market products like copper lead and zinc can be regarded as resources but the reason we own the bulk of our assets is due to extraordinary developments taking place around the world
3215018 we shorted it at the top and it was a huge way to make money at the time
3215019 we knew it was a ridiculous mania just as we know the lending mania we dont call it the housing mania was also totally ridiculous
3215020 we have a bull market in commodity stocks and a bear market in almost everything else
3215021 we appear to be in the midst of a systemic financial meltdown
3215022 the banking system became hugely overleveraged and relied more and more on various tricks to arbitrage or leverage the balance sheet over the last five years we have seriously mispriced credit and only realized it when the system froze up in august 2007
3215023 over the past 10 years or so central banks have appeared almighty seemingly solving every crisis that comes their way by doing what they do best throwing money at the problem an aura of central bank omnipotence is once again being embraced especially by those on wall street who have been the most to benefit from easy money they being the first in line at the printing presses
3215024 the realization that the global credit boom was nothing more than a massive pyramid scheme that is now toppling like a house of cards in a stiff breeze
3215025 the two key factors that most people dont account for regarding commodities are hyperinflation and logistical problems
3215026 the powers that be want to make credit available to all the banking systems and the more they make it available the more inflationary it becomes with commodity costs rising rapidly i can envision serious double digit inflation in the next three to four years that will spill through to consumers who will demand higher wages to offset the higher cost of living on top of that we have logistical problems in terms of supplying so many commodities because every market is as tight as a drum and there are blockages throughout the supply chain so any small problem at the margins like trouble in nigeria immediately spikes up the price of oil
3215027 we believe the u s is already effectively bankrupt and would only be more so in a peak oil world
3215028 the gold market often goes through a consolidation phase but then goes up in a straight line
3215029 although not all commodities are in a bubble there are bubble like characteristics which are particularly profound in the agricultural sector
3215030 stocks have risen 15 fold over the last three years which is reminiscent of the technology bubble in the late 1990s there is an enormous amount of speculative money moving into a fairly small group of assets and we estimate that in the last three years 275 billion has gone into commodities while the commodities trading pool is in the range of 500 billion its like pouring buckets into thimbles
3215031 since the start of the credit crunch a lot of the price movement in oil has been driven more by financial factors than by underlying fundamentals as investors look for new sectors to put their money
3215032 price movements have been very much aligned with the way the dollar is performing and that relationship is not sustainable
3215033 a very minor factor because throughout the whole commodity spectrum there is a long term imbalance between demand and supply
3215034 weve had a beta phase where its been good to be long everything but were now probably moving into a more volatile alpha phase in which you have to be more intelligent regarding the sectors you allocate to and what instruments and trading strategies you use
3215035 we look for the big play what i would even call the easy play
3215036 im a firm believer that you should go where you think returns are the highest for the least amount of risk in 2000 we bought gold stocks when it looked like the price of gold had bottomed for a long time the price had threatened to move up so for us it was an easy call at the time because two years later these stocks were up 500
3215037 we bought the group and purchased names no one had ever heard about and they went up by 500 to 1 000 within two years
3215038 when youre investing you have to look to the future and see what are the odds for making a large return
3215039 i love telling people i meet just give me the absolute upside then well check your assumptions and analyze if it can get that big were not just buying a raw exploration play im not impressed with being told that a stock can go up 25 if were generating returns of 28 in our equity fund were looking for stocks that have the potential to increase 100 or even 1 000
3215040 investors are paying a premium for a global growth opportunity
3215041 but if you are well into a cycle when stocks have gone up this much and managements are incredibly cocky about their future thats when you should start worrying
3215042 its essential to go with what you truly believe in
3215043 because of his convictions he will hold on through thick and thin and he knows how to let his profits run
3215044 he has a very good sense of market movements and is very adept at spotting inflection points in the market
3215045 i love this business and i dont mind doing it 24 7 besides i have a public company and will therefore have co responsibility for making sure that the firm operates properly for quite a while
3215046 the foundation we created is basically looking at hunger in canada and around the world and thats what we would really like to focus on
3215047 as it covers all sectors and invests in larger caps than other funds in the house
3215048 very few people have an opportunity to change the way that they look at things during their lifetime with money
3215049 there are plenty of people who give their lives to politics environmental causes and health causes but without the money to sustain them they wouldnt be able to do so
3215050 the two leading indicators in charitable giving are how people feel about their own personal finances and then the performance of the stock market
3215051 obviously people are worried but there has yet to be any precipitous decrease
3215052 overseas giving isnt something thats new but the level of emphasis has been greater
3215053 people love the idea of microfinance and when youre talking about kids and education abroad a lot of times that ends up meaning microfinance because it is usually the mother who is the head of the family and is running or trying to run a small business to support her children
3215054 to break the cycle of poverty you have to be able to figure out what you have and how to manage that
3215055 if you look back 10 or 20 years the words global warming didnt really resonate with anybody
3215056 people are now beginning to realize that we have these issues and if we dont deal with them real soon we probably will not be able to deal with them long term
3215057 hes committed his own personal money for lobbying for climate change because he believes its a significant challenge that could be devastating for the future
3215058 there are at least a few examples of contributors saying well if we really care about global warming and think that it is an imminent threat to our planet it doesnt make any sense to manage our foundation to exist in perpetuity
3215059 when it comes to hedge fund philanthropists its important not to just look at how theyre giving more money and what kinds of nonprofits theyre donating to but how theyre donating and taking advantage of the multiplier effect
3215060 its looking at how you prove youve had an impact and if youre not having an impact how you use the data to help refine what youre doing
3215061 in sitting down and asking how do i solve this problem hedge fund foundations are realizing that the biggest pocket of funding available will always be from the government so these public private partnership have come about
3215062 youre never going to have more money than the government so the best thing to do is figure out a way to work with them and to push them to use their money more wisely
3215063 its an area thats often overlooked and often sort of seen as a rich kids disease but it isnt
3215064 family and relatives form a natural constituency to support a child with leukemia but that doesnt exist for a child who is abused
3215065 its one of the most important childhood issues that exists but its very low on the list of what gets money
3215066 most hedge fund guys do well even if they dont have a good year so its unlikely that giving among the group will turn down much because of the economy
3215067 a good way to get your non drinking high school girlfriend drunk
3215068 well we were coming down to philadelphia to try and put a penguins jersey on rocky wouldnt that have just been the craziest and we won the first game down here so last night were looking for a place to get some city chicken or some kolbusy and we walked past a hardware store and it just hit me sweep broom and i thought we could show our support for the penguins by wearing a jersey but we can show our support for the number games we would like the penguins to take to eliminate the flyers with a broom because you sweep things with a broom so when we brought our brooms to the game everyone would know that we didnt want the penguins to win in 5 6 or 7 games we wanted them to win in 4
3215069 dr fairman is a pretty big pittsburgh fan all around but when it comes to the penguins he gets a little scary sometimes when rob brown played his last game with pittsburgh in 2000 before going on to an illustrious ahl career dr fairman shaved a giant bald area onto the crown of his head for 2 months in memory of him i suppose
3215070 so maureen mo would you say that fairman is an appropriate last name for such a cheater
3215071 give me my flowers while im still here i cant enjoy them once im gone
3215072 that guy only played 3 46 last night surely this guy is having a laugh
3215073 the more i get to know her the more i admire her i think shes one of the most disciplined people i know shes one of the toughest shes got an extraordinary intelligence and shes somebody whos in this stuff for the right reasons shes passionate about moving the country forward on issues like health care and children
3215074 i think i will be the democrat who will be most effective in going up against a john mccain or any other republican
3215075 because they all want basically a continuation of george bushs policies and because i will offer a clear contrast as somebody who never supported this war thought it was a bad idea
3215076 i have to say senator clinton looked in her element she was taking every opportunity to get a dig in there
3215077 thats her right thats her right to kind of twist the knife a little bit thats why shes only airing negative attacks on tv in pennsylvania like most places i understand that because thats the textbook washington game
3215078 certainly i can i think that senator clinton for a sixty year old chick has got a pretty nice ass
3215079 barack is always thinking three steps ahead what do we need to do to make change
3215080 i cant let my ego my anger my frustration get in the way of the ultimate goal
3215081 barack has been characterised as many things that have nothing to do with who he is
3215082 you have thoughts to touch everyones base thoughts that recognise and flatter everyone
3215083 you put me in this office and my problems are not relevant my job is to think about your problems
3215084 theres been enormous speculation about your political future will you serve your six year term as united states senator from illinois
3215085 im not privy to senate intelligence reports what would i have done i dont know
3215086 theres not much of a difference between my position and george bushs position at this stage
3215087 i think that there is room for disagreement in that initial decision
3215088 it seems to have been reserved to the people of this country by their conduct and example to decide the important question whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force if there be any truth in the remark the crisis at which we are arrived may with propriety be regarded as the era in which that decision is to be made and a wrong election of the part we shall act may in this view deserve to be considered as the general misfortune of mankind
3215089 a light will shine through that window a beam of light will come down upon you you will experience an epiphany and you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote for obama
3215090 i never believe in irreparable breaches im a big believer in reconciliation and redemption
3215091 so look this has been a fierce contest ive said repeatedly come august
3215092 i never believe in irreparable breaches ima big believer in reconciliation and redemption
3215093 the dominant figure in my formative years the values she taught me continue to be my touchstone when it comes to how i go about the world of politics
3215094 she was not a standard issue girl of her times she wasnt part of the matched sweater set crowd
3215095 she touted herself as an atheist and it was something shed read about and could argue
3215096 she was always challenging and arguing and comparing she was already thinking about things that the rest of us hadnt
3215097 she felt she didnt need to date or marry or have children
3215098 it wasnt a put down it wasnt hurtful thats just who she was
3215099 the values she taught me continue to be my touchstone when it comes to how i go about the world of politics
3215100 lets talk about it but nothing will really get done
3215101 i had given her a reassuring smile and patted her hand and told her not to worry i wouldnt do anything stupid it was usually an effective tactic another one of those tricks i had learned people were satisfied so long as you were courteous and smiled and made no sudden moves they were more than satisfied they were relieved such a pleasant surprise to find a well mannered young black man who didnt seem angry all the time
3215102 teefury is a place where you will find amazing tees at amazing prices
3215103 why in the world did she show me this this isnt funny is my daughter hooked on drugs or something
3215104 you need a strategy to triumph over love in a relationship
3215105 but whoever drinks the water i give him will never thirst
3215106 imagine being able to market a program worldwide uniting 2 of the most fluent languages english amp spanish without having verbal communication allowing people from all walks of life around the world to request a callback and having one of our professional dream team members assist them on your behalf answering their questions bringing them into your business and you get paid
3215107 im relieved that i finally found an easy to learn reputable online business that allows me to leave my boring full time dead end sales job and finally work independantly from my home its a dream come true

3215109 membenci adalah bagai minum racun dan berharap orang lain yang mati
3215110 last night i think we set a new record because it took us 45 minutes before we even started talking about a single issue that matters to the american people took us 45 min 45 minutes before we heard about health care 45 minutes before we heard about iraq 45 minutes before we heard about jobs 45 minutes before we heard about gas prices now i dont blame washington for this because thats just how washington is they like stirring up controversy and they like playing gotcha games and getting us to attack each other
3215111 i have to say senator clinton looked in her element she was taking every opportunity to get a dig in there ya know thats alright thats her right thats her right to kind of twist the knife a little bit

3215241 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3215242 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3215243 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3215244 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3215245 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3215246 i dont get you you act like i did something so terrible you act like i cheated on you iv been nothing but nice to you i just wanted to see you more not not see you at all you wont even come see my face

3215268 no estamos en un momento para relajarnos ni para dejar pasar partidos o dejar de corregir lo que no ha salido bien

3215304 too many of these small coastal cetaceans end up as bycatch in fisheries this remains the main threat to them and it is only going to get worse

3215307 disentanglement programmes to release whales captured in fishing gear already carried out in the united states new zealand and australia help some individuals survive

3215309 large parts of the oceans are now filled with human generated noise not only from military sonar but also from seismic surveys and shipping this noise undoubtedly affects many cetaceans in some cases leading to their death
3215310 it may not always kill whales and dolphins but it affects their ability to communicate and it can drive them away at least temporarily from their feeding grounds
3215311 to save whales for future generations we need to work closely with the fishing industry the military and offshore enterprises including shippers and oil developers and we need to fight climate change

3215323 the joke is on actors reaching for roles in terms of hopefully winning awards
3215324 some people have taken this as making fun of handicapped people but were really trying to make fun of the actors who use this material as fodder for acclaim the last thing you want is for people to think youre making fun of the victims in this who are having their lives turned into fodder for people to win oscars
3215325 the film is in no way meant to disparage or harm the image of individuals with disabilities
3215326 we have had productive discussions with representatives of disability advocacy organizations and look forward to working with them closely in the future however no changes or cuts to the film will be made
3215327 data do not exist to say if its a long term trend
3215328 yet there is enough cumulative evidence to suggest real long term increases in jellyfish have occurred in a number of ecosystems
3215329 we as an agency dont have any ongoing studies or data to support that there is an increase in the jellyfish population

3215336 power to seize any financial institution whose failure threatens the entire economy bail out its creditors and close it down
3215337 we need laws that specify and limit the conditions for bail outs
3215338 rather than circuitously through the central bank as was done during the blow up of bear stearns
3215339 our country has long since abandoned the notion that we should leave crises to be resolved solely by the marketplace
3215340 the critical need is to formalise the procedures improvised in the case of bear stearns this should ensure that in the future government financial assistance to lending institutions does not impact the federal reserves balance sheet and monetary policy

3215364 since the 1960s there has been a dispute on the name both names are correct the term the arabian gulf is the original name of the red sea while the persian gulf is the original name given to the sea between iran persia amp the arabian peninsula by early islamic muslim geographers for a short while in the 17th century the term gulf of basra was also being used which made a reference to the town of basra in iraq
3215365 the name of the body of water separating the arabian peninsula from iran has been disputed by some arab countries since the 1960s

3215375 i looked at it and said this needs to be something better for the city of madison than some metal industrial buildings that kind of crop up in these areas
3215376 what really happens when you start building this quality of building and so on it spurs people across the street people in the neighborhood other developers that were looking at projects and saying is it viable on this side of town
3215377 this is going to help put that wreath on the front door to madison and that is through the east side

3215382 let us love him for he himself created all these and he is not far away from them for he did not create them and then go away they are of him and in him behold there he is wherever truth is known he is within the inmost heart yet the heart has wandered away from him return to your heart o you transgressors and hold fast to him who made you stand with him and you shall stand fast rest in him and you shall be at rest where do you go along these rugged paths where are you going the good that you love is from him and insofar as it is also for him it is both good and pleasant but it will rightly be turned to bitterness if whatever comes from him is not rightly loved and if he is deserted for the love of the creature why then will you wander farther and farther in these difficult and toilsome ways there is no rest where you seek it seek what you seek but remember that it is not where you seek it you seek for a blessed life in the land of death it is not there for how can there be a blessed life where life itself is not
3215383 in some moral matters the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
3215384 the morality of such questions lies not in what is done the moral object but in the motive and circumstances therefore because these prudential judgments do not involve a direct choice of something evil and take into consideration various goods it is possible for catholic voters to arrive at different even opposing judgments
3215385 a correct conscience recognizes that there are some choices that always involve doing evil and which can never be done even as a means to a good end
3215386 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
3215387 in light of the above it is a correct judgment of conscience that we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
3215388 what are we do do though when there is no such alternative because we have a moral obligation to vote deciding not to vote at all is not ordinarily an acceptable solution to this dilemma
3215389 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
3215390 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity

3215406 ultimately what is going to be needed is a more comprehensive ecological study of that region and some indication as to whether or not any technology that we have today is likely to be able to clean up spilled oil in that set of conditions

3215423 we have said that this is a condition driven process
3215424 no no definitely there has to be a very clear timeline
3215425 we are only now able to discuss conditions based time horizons because security has improved so much this would not have been possible 18 months ago
3215426 we all look forward to the day when iraqi security forces take the lead on more combat missions allowing u s troops to serve in an overwatch role and more importantly return home
3215427 this was a heinous attack by al qaida in iraq against an iraqi family followed by a cowardly attack against innocent civilians their security forces and u s soldiers
3215428 i did not expect that a terrorist attack to take place in our secure town
3215429 al qaida is to blame for this attack operations in diyala have pushed them here
3215430 obamas race baiting tactics are nothing new he unfairly charged both of racism during the primary and then worked to spin the story to make himself the victim
3215431 obamas statements about race include a subliminal threat branding all white people who oppose him as racists while at the same time appealing to african americans empathy as a victim of racism these tactics are underhanded and i applaud mccain for exposing the senators hypocrisy
3215432 in fact i was just today trying to buy biodegradable plates to take on the bus and we recycle at every stop

3215440 one right here on our home turf now that death magnetic is complete were ready to start a proper indoor arena tour of the states and and we cant wait to visit all of our talli fans here it really has been too long hey whats four years amongst friends
3215441 now ill have to decide the fate of my sanity
3215442 you should remove as posts because theyre just as bad as bs
3215443 its part of the fabric of cumbria and on those grounds alone it ought to be preserved
3215444 we have enough net licences this year for all the guys who were fishing last year
3215445 weve reduced the amount of time they can fish a bit so that we can let more fish escape to spawn
3215446 its very natural for them to get upset and annoyed if you try and put them out of business
3215447 i think the river eden owners association should meet the haaf netters and get an agreed policy and put that to government

3215451 we believe the area from which the laser is coming from is possibly the finnis street area in town but we dont have much to go on at this stage
3215452 it swelled up pretty good and were taking the pictures so well see
3215453 weve made progress but weve got a long way to go as were developing our second and third units too
3215454 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3215455 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3215456 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3215457 my family was told by the military to leave because they said moros muslims were advancing
3215458 we left at dawn but my father had to stay behind to protect our house
3215459 my mother took us here but she is away to look for food and relatives who were also told to evacuate
3215460 their lives are already at a standstill classes have been suspended livelihoods abandoned and their lives in danger
3215461 this is the first time in years weve had a big evacuation you can see that even the farm animals have been evacuated and we dont know where to put them
3215462 the bullets were landing near where we were hiding its frightening and sooner or later the bullets will hit those trying to escape
3215463 i dont know when my mother will return but maybe were safe here since there are a lot of soldiers
3215464 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3215465 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3215466 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3215467 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3215468 once i had a chat with god but it was not really all that odd i said hey he said good day in a classic way
3215469 your sheriffs are overwhelmed because of a broken criminal justice system
3215470 but i believe the leaders of the state democratic party have swerved far left
3215471 did they really take that picture that looks freaking amazing
3215472 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3215473 i think he feels much more ready to go to the polls
3215474 he is more confident and more focused the green shift has given him a sense of purpose and boldness he is absolutely convinced he has a better plan for canada than harper does
3215475 what is the point of propping up another political party to the status of government and getting absolutely nothing for it except abuse
3215476 its something that will increase what we do for the public and serve them much better many younger people believe they can do a text message today to 911 and they cannot
3215477 if you give them a lot of data you have to give them a way to digest it all
3215478 bounced and rolled just under 300 feet landing in a ditch
3215479 when i came to i knew i had rebroken my collarbone
3215480 when the police and fireman got there they asked me wheres the guy who was in the wreck
3215481 now that i have a newborn daughter so much was going through my head
3215482 tantos m s de este ambiente pol tico que vivimos
3215483 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
3215484 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
3215485 the american academy of pediatrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run
3215486 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3215487 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3215488 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3215489 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3215490 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3215491 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3215492 its very clear that eliminating this protein has cardiovascular benefits
3215493 rna based drugs might provide a course of treatment for people whose cholesterol levels are resistant to current drugs or they might be combined with current drugs
3215494 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
3215495 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3215496 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
3215497 legally there is no case against mirza azam as the investigation was not completed within the specified time after filing the case against him
3215498 the query is based on surmises id say that the chief adviser has already declared that the emergency will be lifted in phases and we do hope that itll be so before the elections
3215499 the international communities have pledged to provide support to the cg during the december elections and the ca has in the meantime assured the emergency will be lifted
3215500 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3215501 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3215502 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3215503 reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed
3215504 a medical board will be formed today the director general of the health directorate will be directed to make necessary arrangements
3215505 the law enforcers including the army will not be vested with any judicial powers but they will be able to arrest people without warrants
3215506 the results of the polls to four city corporations and nine municipalities will be published this week
3215507 as the candidates signed the nomination papers accepting those conditions they should give up their party posts
3215508 if they change their decision now the voters will judge them
3215509 if anybody goes to court the government will handle it
3215510 the law ministry will form a tribunal along with the joint district judge and district judge at the suggestion of the supreme court
3215511 i came in the boot of a car georgian snipers were firing at us from the forest i heard the bullets hitting the chassis
3215512 my brother stayed to fight our grandparents home was turned to rubble we dont know where they are nothing is left of their village it was totally destroyed by rockets and tank fire
3215513 i got out this morning a friend found me and brought me out on the back of his motorbike i was already waiting for death in my basement the city is in ruins there are bodies lying in the street
3215514 all i have left is the clothes im standing in and these two bags my house was wooden it was turned to splinters by the shells i climbed out of the ruins i dont know where i will go i dont know what to do
3215515 i saw our house in flames as we ran theres nothing left for us to go back to our lives are ruined
3215516 people have no water no electricity no gas and no food
3215517 my relatives told me georgian soldiers burnt to death a family of seven people in their apartment an 18 year old boy who climbed out into the street for a few moments was shot dead by a sniper
3215518 we sat for four days in a cellar without food and water
3215519 when we came out we saw the whole street had burnt down the city was gone only ruins were left it was a slaughter first they bombed and shelled us then the tanks came in and levelled the city to the ground
3215520 i dont know what i will do now my town no longer exists my brother is still there fighting
3215521 when the firing died down i ran out to the home of my relatives on a different street
3215522 i saw that the city hospital was completed destroyed and around it lay corpses and injured people a lot of them and the injured lay there dying for three days because no one could get to them
3215523 where were the russian troops for the first three days now they say on television that russia defended us they saved south ossetia but thats rubbish
3215524 russian tanks only came this morning when we had already pushed the georgian forces out of tskhinvali we did it ossetians ourselves at the cost of many lives and russia came only at the end to take up positions that we had already won and now im lying here and my friends go on dying there
3215525 ossetian patriots first let us cleanse our markets of georgian spies then forward to liberate the homeland
3215526 we are sending men who have done military service so teenage lads dont go to die
3215527 in tskhinvali you cant find one brick standing on top of another the city is still disputed there are georgian strong points on the hills surrounding it im going back to fight tonight ive got my own team of guys
3215528 my cousin came from dmenis village last night he got two bullets in the back were going to go there and slaughter the georgians like the fascist pigs they are if the russians let us well smash them all the way to tbilisi we are a warrior race we know how to fight
3215529 the georgians hit our positions with grad missiles they surrounded us but we managed to break out if im needed ill be heading back
3215530 a 78 year old woman with an infant under each arm was crushed by a tank
3215531 a lot of volunteers are getting held up in the north of the republic but we wanted to get straight to the action
3215532 no one can say whether the eu will send a polls observation mission to bangladesh because the decision is to be taken by the ecs external relations wing on the basis of the report submitted by the exploratory mission which visited bangladesh in june
3215533 by the end of september or early october the ec could decide on sending an observation mission to bangladesh the french ambassador said
3215534 where was the state of emergency i did not find any state of emergency while visiting the pourashabha polls in fulbaria mymensignh
3215535 france and other european countries share the same view that the next parliamentary polls could be held under the state of emergency if the voters cast votes and the candidates carried out campaigns rallies and other publicity activities
3215536 it is interesting that the political parties are only demanding a lifting of the state of emergency
3215537 we could reactivate the surrey section for a sum around 150 million i believe it is the same thing goes for langley and if you go up the valley that would mean that we could reactivate the entire system for less than the cost of two kilometres of the rav line
3215538 the entire valley was built around this corridor and its just the provincial government needs to realize that this has to be protected and the sooner its reactivated the better for everybody in the valley
3215539 for us its a milestone and opens a window to the past
3215540 i have always been a very competitive person and always wanted to win
3215541 seeing kentucky winning national titles every year made me want to be a wildcat
3215542 i tied with two other girls for the final two spots on the blue squad and those spots were not filled at tryouts
3215543 making the blue squad as a freshman is very difficult to do
3215544 if you are on blue and the coaches dont think you are performing up to their standards then you could be put on white
3215545 if you are on white and the coaches see you improving they could put you on blue
3215546 he had been pushing me to improve and to get new skills so that i could someday be on uks team he was impressed with my talent and wanted me to be my best
3215547 i met one on one with the head coach jomo thompson
3215548 he viewed a skills tape at that time and gave me his invitation to tryouts in april
3215549 each day consisted of tumbling stunting dance memorizing routines and personal interviews
3215550 to be a uk cheerleader requires hard work and self discipline i know that it will require a lot of traveling practice sacrifice and hard work
3215551 i have wanted to be a uk cheerleader since sixth grade and i will work hard to maintain that honor and keep my spot on the squad
3215552 i was in a weight lifting class my junior year at jackson and i could show the boys up on the leg press machine
3215553 i have probably made more sacrifices in my sport than any other athlete in any other sport while others were sleeping in during summer break i was in the gym while others were vacationing i was at summer practices and working my individual tumbling and stunting skills
3215554 i have learned self discipline hard work and dedication truly pay off
3215555 sports and competition in general teach you many valuable life lessons
3215556 my family has made many sacrifices in order for me to become the person and cheerleader i am today
3215557 we are a very close family and they have been beside me supporting me every step of the way
3215558 we felt the location we had there by heartland behavioral center the 14 acres at nova park wasnt big enough
3215559 it doesnt change anything it is a different school district and im sure were going to have to initiate discussions with the perry local schools because they shearers are going to be filing a tax abatement request
3215560 it enables us to expand especially in years to come
3215561 new housing is down in massillon new housing is down in stark county its down in ohio and in the midwest
3215562 it would be my recommendation to just lay low right now and do other things to save money down there
3215563 we would have liked to have had the opportunity to present some bids to council but it just didnt happen
3215564 maintained its place as an ohio golf destination by continuing to offer pristine conditions at a great price
3215565 im very pleased with the year weve had out there when it comes to day to day operations increased play from lowering our senior rate and from word of mouth
3215566 the word out there is that the course is back up to the quality of play it once was
3215567 we have city ordinances which basically mirror the state code
3215568 a good example is assault an assault under the city ordinance reads exactly the same as the state ordinance
3215569 before 2003 there was this unwritten agreement that they wouldnt bill us and we wouldnt pay
3215570 then in 03 they started sending bills with no expectation of payment
3215571 not that anyone wants to give up 130 000 a year
3215572 but at this point i dont see any other way
3215573 refuses to pay plaintiffs at the correct royalty rate for its digital exploitation of the capricorn masters
3215574 umg incurs practically no expenses or risks in connection with the masters particularly with respect to licensing other companies such as apple to create and distribute digital downloads yet umg reaps millions of dollars every year from such exploitation
3215575 the film revealed more mistakes than i was able to catch with the naked eye on saturday
3215576 what was a disappointment for me on saturday turned into frustration and anger for me monday i studied it saturday afternoon i looked at it for seven hours on sunday and then we showed it to the kids on monday
3215577 they were very quiet when we showed them the film but we have to scrutinize it and benefit from what we see there
3215578 im very disappointed with the way we played i thought we self destructed offensively and then stopped ourselves
3215579 not to take anything away from dover but i dont know if they stopped us as much as we stopped ourselves defensively we were just awful we were beat deep twice for long touchdown throws and the quarterback was able to scramble twice for long touchdown runs
3215580 offensively we had nice gains and threw the ball well and had major completions for big chunks of yardage but then wed have four bad plays in a row
3215581 a tight end makes the wrong call a fullback or tailback misses a protection assignment we drop a pass a tailback goes the wrong way on a running play things that are totally 100 percent within our control those are pre snap mistakes thats like football suicide thats what we did we committed football suicide on offense
3215582 after everything that id seen the way that wed practiced and the number of players that we had returning that was not the first scrimmage performance that i expected im just very disappointed
3215583 i didnt feel like that was the way wed been practicing at all if i had i wouldnt have had higher expectations for our first scrimmage so either i didnt see what was really there or i overstated our ability to play in that first scrimmage
3215584 ive done this a long time and i understand that no one is going to be perfect in a first scrimmage but i certainly expected us to play a whole lot better than we did
3215585 that means that we cant assume that our kids understand or know anything that we want them to do
3215586 it was a very good way to start the season
3215587 overall a win is a win i just had to keep grinding at it the wind kept changing and it was more challenging than usual but i hit the ball solid today winning is a great confidence booster for our team
3215588 but we cant make as many mental mistakes out there if were going to do anything special this season
3215589 i havent played here in over a year so there were times i couldnt remember what the course was like and i thought too much
3215590 but overall i thought i struck the ball pretty well
3215591 i had six three putts it was a tough day for the whole team i just want to forget about the whole round and work on my game by putting in a couple hours of practice
3215592 my short game is weak i felt my irons and my driver were good but i just need to practice more
3215593 i thought the tournament went great and the weather was perfect
3215594 id probably give us a c plus on the scrimmage after thinking about it
3215595 football comes down to a couple of things you tackle you catch and you block its not hard so we have to get better at those three phases we have to get better at tackling we have to get better at catching and we have to get better at blocking
3215596 we had a couple of breakdowns we have to address just little things
3215597 a lot of it is just not knowing what youre facing but still our kids have to be able to adapt on the run thats football we really need to work on some perimeter blocking so were going to concentrate on that a lot this week
3215598 defensively were just going to work on running and tackling the ball and doing the fundamental defensive stuff all in all we went into the scrimmage trying to see all of our plays and to be able to coach our kids up
3215599 i think were coming along at a good pace at the same time we dont want to be scheme rich and execution poor we want to feed them in good portions and not overload them were still in the feeding process
3215600 the good thing about this scrimmage coming up is that its going to be live and our quarterbacks are going to be able to run and we can sprint them out and be able to do some stuff where we can see their strengths really shine
3215601 theyre athletic running quarterbacks and i think thats where youre going to see their potential and where the offense is going to go
3215602 im not trying to put a drive together or were not trying to oh theyre doing this so lets scheme this way
3215603 were formatting that to get better and thats the way i approach scrimmages work on the plays that weve been practicing so we can get better
3215604 what i was thinking was this was something that was personal to my own family
3215605 john mccain talk about the mistakes that hes made in his past with respect to his first marriage
3215606 before he even asked i put doug peters msums athletic director on the cabinet i believe very much athletics arent an afterthought they are the fabric of the institution i looked at the institution i looked around at my cabinet and athletics wasnt reporting directly to the president and that didnt make a whole lot of sense with the emphasis i place on it
3215607 i have to get the scholarship dollars up we have to get up to a respectable rank within the conference thats all there is to it athletics are too important for it not to have this kind of effort of my energy and effort since i started here id say the majority of my fundraising work has centered around athletics
3215608 but there is something else to that that no too many other people can say if we do athletic fund raising right then i can generate a whole lot more interest around out athletic activities i can use those activities to bring alumni to our campus in greater numbers i can use those opportunities you see to fundraise for many other things
3215609 triple a is cheeseburgers and peanut butter and jelly sandwiches on a commercial flight in a middle seat between two random passengers
3215610 the soldiers were provided with combat first aid by other members of the sotg to stabilise their condition and the area surrounding the blast site was secured in preparation for a helicopter casualty evacuation
3215611 on arrival at the site an isaf medevac helicopter was damaged in a hard landing rendering it incapable of completing its casualty evacuation task
3215612 we do find that many flag carrier airlines suffer fairly vitriolic levels of reporting in their local regions and the airline industry remains a business that some areas of the press seem to love to hate
3215613 the lounge concept for both product and staff service has been modelled around the finest quality you would expect to find in a five star hotel or restaurant and the best part is that the concept is being so well delivered by qantas
3215614 what we would be looking to do with any form of original content is the added component that zune could provide that itunes or any competing service couldnt
3215615 i believe that random acts of violence are random acts of violence this was a case of the wrong place at the wrong time
3215616 it is the view of local law enforcement and u s authorities that this was not premeditated not targeted not specific
3215617 where is rodney dangerfield when we need him there are some heated
3215618 this means the considerable amount of online gt gt gt video available to other users is out of reach of the linux crowd
3215619 you wonder why theyd want to kiss off 2 3 gt gt gt of the desktops
3215620 it wasnt for them about south ossetia its about controlling energy
3215621 i think we went slightly off the boil here we didnt bat as well as we had in the rest of the series but credit to england for finishing it off we came with a goal to win the series and were pleased to have done that weve got australia in a few months time and thats a whole new challenge but this has been a real collective effort everybodys contributed my innings at edgbaston was a highlight of my life never mind my career
3215622 its been a great few days for the side after all the commotion at the start of last week i couldnt have asked any more from the guys a pretty fair reflection of the series weve tried our hardest but its the start of a new era its about regrouping now this weekend before we start a difficult one day series i couldnt have asked for any more from steve harmison and id have rather the big man had got man of the match but weve shown this week that if we hit our straps we can beat anyone
3215623 reading the stories of disenchanted kids endeavouring to obtain their heroes autographs only to be turned away is incredibly sad i have a fantastic memory of chris cairns blasting a century as the 1994 nottinghamshire side andy picks benefit match played at my local club when he eventually got out and on seeing this young aspiring cricketer clearly in awe of his batting ability applauding he took off his pads went into the bar and bought two cans of coke and two packets of smoky bacon crisps he then emerged handing me a can and one of his packets of crisps and asked if i would like to walk around the boundary with him if only all pros could remember what its all about
3215624 i remember the 1991 oval test against the west indies robin smith had scored a ton and was relaxing on the players balcony my then girlfriend walked over to him with pen in hand and just as he was going to give her his autograph she asked if he would be good enough to go and get alec stewarts signature for her his face was priceless but fair dos he went and got it
3215625 mark can i ask that you avoid phrases such as the score is creeping along here and england are on fire now nothing is more likely to cost us the match today than someone pointing how well we are doing and the nerves are shaky enough as it is
3215626 on the subject of nasser hussain 1149 nasser might be a bit of a cold fish but ive always given him the benefit of the doubt since an incident when we were at the same college id encountered some local student bashers who were cheerfully using my head as a football when nasser lead the university first xi to the rescue and chased the miscreants off in case i didnt say it at the time thanks nass
3215627 quite a few years ago my brother was an umpire at an indoor cricket centre one evening he took me along as there was a celebrity match taking place between portsmouth amp southampton football clubs i went along to watch and i was stood next to a guy chatting for ages i eventually realised it was malcolm marshall what a great bloke he was
3215628 when i was younger i was waiting in the car park at canterbury to get steve waughs autograph on his debut for kent a man wearing sunglasses pulled up in a luxury car and i thought id better get his autograph just in case he was a big player id never heard of when mark ealham was signing my book later he noticed the signature and asked who it was slightly unnerved i replied min patel to which mark responded min patel is in pakistan thats the kit mans autograph
3215629 the first game i saw was gloucestershire take on oxford university at the parks only recognising jack russell in the field big clue with the pads and gloves i cheered every time he caught a ball when rain interrupted play i ambled over to get his autograph when i got to the dressing rooms he was waiting at the gate asking what kept me he then took me into the dressing room where i got all the gloucestershire autographs and played five a side football with them before the game was called off jack got his england call up shortly afterwards and has remained a hero since
3215630 a few years ago i was playing for sussex 2nd xi v essex at chelmsford i had been run out for a supremely incompetent six runs batting at number nine having not bowled when one of the essex fans asked me for my autograph just as i was about to walk up the stairs to the changing rooms it made my day and i signed merrily away imagining what it would be like to have to fend off hundreds of kids wanting my signature now 12 years later on i work for a bank having never made the top grade and that fan has probably never looked at that page in his autograph book again
3215631 all of a sudden theres a little bit of tension in the crowd and if another couple of wickets were to fall it would make it a very interesting finish
3215632 i went to a viv richards benefit match at a local village ground in somerset when i was 11 joel big bird garner stood on the boundary and patiently signed every autograph request with a smile and a little personal chat vic marks did so but seemed almost embarrassed to have been asked as for the great man himself took me ages to get through the crowds of taller boys surrounding sir viv only for him to tell me he didnt like people who pushed and refuse to sign my programme scarred for life
3215633 re tom 1218 lara is a top man he once signed and gave me his scoresheet after getting 103 in barbados on the golf course i believe centuries are rarer for him with the club than the bat but he wasnt that pleased
3215634 i was fortunate enough to be at the headingley test of the famous bothams ashes series after the game i waited outside the dressing room but all i had was box of chocolates to use an impromptu autograph book geoff boycott was the first to sign it after that dennis lillee came out of the dressing room i handed him the box he took one look at boycotts signature mumbled im not signing next to that turned the box over and signed on the other side
3215635 when i was about 13 i went to see the british masters golf at woburn at the time nick faldo was probably the best player in the world but when i tried to get his autograph after his round he was surly and refused to sign even now when i see him on tv i become that disillusioned kid again
3215636 of course cook famously always gets out in the 60s
3215637 my club side hosted a benefit game for asif din and he brought along allan donald what a top bloke
3215638 nasser hussain 1149 is the spitting image of vladimir putin
3215639 re 1204 was that the name of the opening bat for englands women or the whole of the top order
3215640 i was watching glamorgan playing india many moons ago before i knew who was who three indian cricketers were approaching and dad encouraged me to go and ask them for autographs one put his arm around my shoulder and kindly got his two team mates to sign as well dad looked at the results and whistled prasanna venkat and chandrasekar
3215641 good morning mark re jo jackson what is it about parents who dont stop and think when they name their children presumably all her life jo jackson has had people asking her are you really going out with him and thinking it really original my favourite was created by mr and mrs hyde when they called their daughter jacqueline honest
3215642 i was once hanging around outside the away dressing room at the oval when surrey had played yorkshire myself and the other boys were starting to despair when sir geoffrey appeared through the door pointed at me and said would you like an autograph i nodded come in here then and i followed him into the dressing room where the rest of the yorkshire team were preparing to leave he insisted that every player sign my book signed it himself and then said grab my bag the cars in the car park so i became the only successful autograph hunter that day as well gbs personal porter
3215643 as a young teenager and not knowing the protocol i approached tournament leader peter alliss for his autograph as he walked down the first fairway on his final round of a a pro am tournament in bangor county down in classic alliss style he smiled at me saying this is not quite the time sonny but signed my autograph book anyway and its my birthday today and i am older than joe jackson
3215644 kallis and gatt at the same game 1215 tough match for the caterers
3215645 i was at the scg in january 2003 when matthew hayden was trying to ignore a young aussie kid with a miniature bat for signing he got tonnes of grief from us in the barmy army and the aussies as well after a good hour he finally relented and signed it within the next hour he had started and finished his innings after a shocking lbw decision and went on to cop a fine for smashing a window in the pavilion i think we put a hex on him
3215646 i remember allan donald going round edgbaston not long after he joined warwickshire during a sunday league game that he was injured for he made sure he signed every kids autograph all the way round then went back round again to make sure he hadnt missed any thats professionalism for you
3215647 aged about 10 i went to a test match at headingley with my dad and ran on to the pitch at lunch to get dickie birds signature he told me to come back at tea time dutifully i ran back on at tea only for him to snap at me not now son at the close of play at the close he changed tack somewhat and simply told me to go away kapil dev on the other hand was an absolute gent when i asked for his autograph he also ruffled my hair lovely man
3215648 whilst volunteering for st john ambulance at lords in 2005 i came out of the pavilion to be accosted by two small boys asking if id sign their bats i wondered why but duly obliged just before the boys left they said thank you marcus i didnt have the heart to tell them and two minutes later the real tresco walked past
3215649 when i was eight i once watched norfolk v warwickshire brian lara was playing and on his way to the team bus after the game not only did he sign my miniature bat but he asked me to carry his bag whilst he signed autographs for everyone else what a top guy
3215650 i remember as a lad going to lords to see middlesex v surrey in a one day game with my autograph book wandering around on the boundary that day was the great mike gatting who i managed to get to sign later in the innings a player whose name i didnt recognise was patrolling the boundary and i decided against getting such a signature that name jacques kallis
3215651 what i want to know is why are we playing only four tests against the number two test team in the world but played six consecutive tests home and away against nz it seems these days we only play five tests against is the aussies drop or cut down all these meaningless odis and get some more test cricket played
3215652 re angus 1125 you must have caught boycs on a bad day we saw him after day 3 at edgbaston asked the same question and he couldnt have been more accommodating
3215653 got the audio feed on the headphones live olympic badminton on one web page and this live text on the other i love monday and just saw a catch off a no ball if i was being hand fed chocolates by heather graham wearing nothing but a huddersfield giants scarf id know id died and gone to heaven cheers cheers cheers bbc
3215654 on the subject of autograph hunting as a seven year old my dad took me to see somerset v essex
3215655 hi mark re the jo jackson comments i note that there have been no british male medallists thus far at the olympics
3215656 its my birthday today and ive reached the big 40 a win to kick off the new captains reign with all the top five batsmen scoring exactly 40 would be a great present
3215657 whats the point of playing rain affected tests against nz in june and then finishing up before the best of the summer
3215658 was at the oval yesterday and bumped into shaun pollock on the way out asked him for a photo which he obliged even saying it the rain would wee on us if we didnt hurry up then saw geoff boycott and asked him the same question and got a big no from the great man before he turned and fled
3215659 draw can see it now england 152 1 rain stops play our best batting knock for a long time some solid shots big hits and an all round superb display stopped by rain
3215660 tricky day for england sa need to shake off the end of term blues and win ito show how dominant they have been and illustrate englands batting selection and captaincy incompetence a win for england will just confirm the status quo and that everything will be all right with the current way things are handled by the ecb
3215661 it may be englands last day of test cricket till 11 december but more to the point it is tim ambroses last day of international cricket or it should be anyway
3215662 jo jackson stepping out 1036 was that a reference to singer joe jacksons 1982 hit
3215663 for a period in history if the series was level the final test would be a timeless test it would be interesting to still be playing on this pitch on the eighth day
3215664 going off for rain when they did was in englands favour as south africa would have had a lot of adrenaline from that partnership between de villiers and harris but if they can knock out two or three with the new ball they know theres some fragility to england as theyre a batter light isnt it a shame that were not in the middle of august yet and this is the last day of test cricket
3215665 what a lucky chap i am i have a job where i can choose when i go out and as luck would have it i am going to see a client so i shall leave at 11 and listen to tms in the car i am very nervous for the boys as they have a habit of imploding in these situations
3215666 another nervous day in prospect although i will stick my neck out and say england will crawl over the line with three wickets remaining
3215667 this is a team effort today its not about individuals well just be going out there and trying to knock off the total
3215668 wakey wakey mark im assuming you meant a result is more likely than a draw
3215669 im here at the oval watching england warm up and monty is looking in fine nick
3215670 as someone who lived under communism for most of his life i feel obliged to say that i see the biggest threat to freedom democracy the market economy and prosperity now in ambitious environmentalism let us not scare ourselves with catastrophic forecasts or use them to defend and promote irrational interventions in human lives
3215671 attempts by governments to legislate costly regulations on industry and individual citizens to encourage co2 reduction will slow development while having no appreciable impact on the future trajectory of global climate change such policies will markedly diminish future prosperity and so reduce the ability of societies to adapt to inevitable climate change thereby increasing not decreasing human suffering
3215672 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
3215673 im willing to make a big financial bet on it in 10 years i expect the globe to be somewhat cooler than it is now because this ocean effect will dominate over the human induced co 2 effect and i believe the solar effect and the land use effect i think this is likely bigger
3215674 we need speed we need players i like him out there at second base he makes our infield stronger the whole deal
3215675 im concerned that this figure of 100 000 job losses is on top of the treasury prediction in may
3215676 i have asked the government repeatedly to explain why it predicted 134 000 job losses
3215677 this is very serious this is about peoples jobs peoples livelihoods and the government must come clean and indicate where why and which areas of the economy there are going to be job losses
3215678 the reserve bank was put in an impossible position last year by the incoming rudd government
3215679 it had inherited the best economic conditions of any incoming federal government in our history yet both kevin rudd and wayne swan went overboard in their rush to blacken the economic credentials of the howard government
3215680 in fact business and consumer confidence remained strong through the asian economic crisis
3215681 even post september 11 when the world thought it was on the brink of some catastrophic outcome business and consumer confidence dropped but came back up again because people had confidence in the leadership of the country to steer them through these difficult international times
3215682 businesses are all aware of employment minister julia gillards attacks on employers
3215683 she has said time and time again that employers cant be trusted because they will sack good workers for no reason
3215684 because if the serbs couldnt have it they didnt want us to have it
3215685 the other morning damien thi ry was in the meeting room of the town hall here where every month or so at public council sessions
3215686 should flanders ever secede an independent flemish nation that hoped to regain european union membership would need to respect popular elections including his he added ruefully
3215687 francophones have now come to talk about linguistic cleansing flemish many of them openly resentful of subsidizing poorer french speaking compatriots who for years lorded it over them economically and otherwise unemployment today is three times higher in rust belt wallonia say the issue is preserving national heritage
3215688 arnold toynbee observed that all great civilizations rise and fall and that an autopsy of history would show that all great nations commit suicide
3215689 turn america into a bilingual or multi lingual and bi cultural country
3215690 the apparent success of our own multi ethnic and multi cultural experiment might have been achieved not by tolerance but by hegemony
3215691 lamm said i would encourage all immigrants to keep their own language and culture
3215692 of course we believe everyone should deserve the protection of this bill who could be more vulnerable than a newborn baby so of course we agree with that we join with an aye vote on this i hope it will in fact be unanimous
3215693 in which he voted for any regulation or restriction on the practice of abortion
3215694 celebrate the wonderful boy my brother was and the life he has had
3215695 we will all be there to get through it and will share the memories doujon would like us to share he wrote
3215696 be strong everyone and i know your prayers are with us and you are all greatly in our hearts
3215697 in nearly every category measured ad effectiveness scores on branded content sites were numerically higher than on the web in general on generic portals or on ad networks branded content sites deliver better advertising results
3215698 nearly all forms of online media have an important role to play throughout the purchase funnel
3215699 but branded content sites have a notably greater impact at the points where consumers are establishing brand preference and making purchase decisions
3215700 branded content sites are doing a particularly effective job of delivering results with developing advertising formats including video advertising and rich media
3215701 just as we have seen with offline media the value of context cannot be underestimated a point that is clearly reaffirmed in this study a sponsorship on a brand name site delivers the power of that brand to the advertiser associated with that content
3215702 human rights allow all humans to have the right to get married
3215703 do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of god do not be decieved neither the sexually immoral nor idolators nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexual offenders nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of god and that is what some of you were but you were justified in the name of the lord jesus christ and by the spirit of our god
3215704 homosexuality has done nothing to further the advance of mankind
3215705 were going to have to win a lot of games
3215706 theres some atmosphere out there we woke up and there were clear skies it feels really good its really pleasant out there
3215707 its great to come here at 9 in the morning and everybodys fired up
3215708 i think everybody had their morning coffee the fans were wonderful
3215709 we played better volleyball today and the conditions were nicer
3215710 we dont care though it could be sweltering it could be freezing we want to play good volleyball and it felt way better today we cut down on our unforced errors and i felt like they had to fight tooth and nail for every single point
3215711 were used to playing three matches a day and getting it over before one oclock
3215712 hell yeah boys they keep trying to play these mind games well just keep on winning think about this for a week boys
3215713 they just havent shown what they were earlier in the season if i had to put my chips on the table you have got jimmie and carl edwards that seem like the guys to beat i would put kyle next
3215714 he was almost leading all three of nascars national series so if its a question of pressure thats been answered
3215715 it feels good to go in on top but its a lot of work to stay there
3215716 theres evidence that the bus may have suffered tire tread separation
3215717 the wheel and the remnants of the tire are still intact on the bus so it looks like something deteriorated in the tire
3215718 hey bill we got a new test developed for synthetic hgh can you go down to the 2008 olympic pee freezer and pull samples 3021 through 3044
3215719 salt sensitivity in children is low and rises with increasing age through adulthood
3215720 during adolescence about 18 percent to 20 percent of adolescents in the general population have the condition however in the study salt sensitivity was present in 37 percent of all low birth weight lbw and in 47 percent of the children who were small for gestational age sga
3215721 these children should be followed for signs of reduced renal function and also for an elevated blood pressure
3215722 almost all of us gastroenterologists and internists have become complacent about the use of these medications
3215723 this makes us all take a step back and look at all the patients we have on these medications and ask whether they require still being on this medication at this dosage at this frequency can we make some alterations in their dosing regimen can we switch them do they need to be on anything at all at this point
3215724 since congenitally blind individuals could not have learned pride and shame behaviors from watching others these displays of victory or defeat are likely to be an innate biological propensity in humans rather than learned behaviour
3215725 these findings support evolutionary accounts that pride and shame would have been powerful mechanisms in enhancing or inhibiting an individuals social status
3215726 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3215727 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3215728 comparing like schools with like schools to measure differences in school results
3215729 were not talking about anything as simplistic and silly as league tables
3215730 but we are talking about parents and the community understanding what kinds of students are in schools their socio economic status the number of indigenous students the number of students with disabilities because that obviously means the schools have special needs
3215731 the aim should be to robustly ascertain what mix of capacities and needs children are bringing to their school
3215732 we need this information in order to understand what schools in turn should offer to these students and how governments and communities working together can support schools to do so
3215733 as a nation we should then be tracking attainment knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools
3215734 we should be able to identify best practice and innovation and work systematically to ensure that they are spread more widely we should be able to especially assist those schools that need it specifically we should be identifying excellent teaching and excellent school leadership we must expect high standards of every child
3215735 there is considerable concern with proposals to excessively tag students and schools with various labels for little purpose
3215736 nsw is responsible for the welfare and education of its students and is committed to the constructive application of the outcomes of assessment in all its forms
3215737 its like hospitals its the rules around that ranking because if youre going to stand in a hospital and its a similar example with schools like westmead and compare it for example with a small district hospital like canterbury and then attempt in some way from the straight statistics that appear on that list to rank those two hospitals you would not be comparing like with like
3215738 public schools nationwide require an immediate 1 4 billion per annum to raise retention rates to 90 per cent and a further 1 3 billion per annum to ensure that all primary school age children reach the minimum benchmark scores for literacy and numeracy
3215739 already julia gillard has failed the first test in refusing to release the individual results of the national literacy and numeracy tests until the end of this year the whole reason the coalition government introduced these tests was to provide parents and schools with information in a timely fashion so parents could get help straightaway
3215740 vouchers represent an attempt to commodify education and an abrogation on the part ofgovernment for ensuring planned provision of education
3215741 rather the structure and funding of vet has to give students and industry the power to get providers to respond to their needs
3215742 there are a number of ways of achieving this reform but an ill thought through badly implemented voucher program like the howard governments work skills vouchers isnt one of them
3215743 the last voucher system was trialled but it really was both poorly targeted and inadequately funded
3215744 we are just keen to see that in the next commonwealth and state agreement that comes in force in july next year whatever funding agreement is ultimately agreed that theres a lift in training funding
3215745 if two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results we would then be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer
3215746 she the woman had now been laying in the sun for about 40 minutes
3215747 imagine if that lady was elderly and having a heart attack or a stroke what the consequences may have been
3215748 i observed what appeared to be three young men hovering around another person lying on the ground
3215749 i do not blame the police or qas all praise on these people and all other emergency service workers at the coal face but i blame the system that we keep being told is the best in the world
3215750 they understand there is a threat but while it exists its not going to be in their lifetime or maybe even in their childrens he said
3215751 people want to live by the sea and a lot of them will take these risks he said
3215752 theyll accept them hoping a solution can be found they think perhaps a sea wall can be built dr hunter said it was wrong to think the problems posed by rising sea levels were years away home index page
3215753 the worst of the top six in terms of singing skills
3215754 only something that smashes social norms could elicit such a response
3215755 after all in china the opportunities to use votes to choose are relatively few
3215756 how come an imitation of a democratic system ends up selecting the singer who has the least ability to carry a tune
3215757 i see youre from utah have you had your dinner
3215758 follow me were having a big 24th of july celebration at the park and there is plenty of food

3215760 its out of the way now and im just swimming to have fun
3215761 refuses to pay plaintiffs at the correct royalty rate for its digital exploitation of the capricorn masters
3215762 it appears that older persons have fewer decisions to make because their spending and economic activity has already been narrowed to necessities given their fixed incomes
3215763 itll take me a couple of months to pay it off
3215764 i think our numbers have gone down because of gas prices these poor ladies who get 400 a month are not coming down as much
3215765 rising food and gas costs are affecting our overall costs
3215766 if you can afford the full donation price great but it is just a donation
3215767 at the same time i think they need to realize that were struggling too i need to capture as much revenue as i can to offset these expenses
3215768 the seniors can bring their own chocolate flavoring we just cant afford it
3215769 some do it to keep active others really depend on it for extra income
3215770 the food is pretty high in the grocery store thats why i have to go back to work
3215771 i go out one day a week instead of two or three

3215780 since the 1960s there has been a dispute on the name both names are correct the term the arabian gulf is the original name of the red sea while the persian gulf is the original name given to the sea between iran persia amp the arabian peninsula by early islamic muslim geographers for a short while in the 17th century the term gulf of basra was also being used which made a reference to the town of basra in iraq
3215781 the name of the body of water separating the arabian peninsula from iran has been disputed by some arab countries since the 1960s
3215782 to live at peace with everyone as far as it depends on us

3215786 if you wrote this book in america it would be oh yeah weve heard that before
3215787 a lot of new zealanders are like me they talk about all these things in private
3215788 some people would say oh but she hasnt had children shes missed out on family life
3215789 but i think the main message is you can always start again
3215790 your life is not over because your marriage failed or your job failed you can always start again
3215791 human beings are unbelievably resilient its never too late to do anything
3215792 having a job and being free to travel is 100 percent commitment i had to make the choice
3215793 i know how men do it because theyre supported by women i dont know how some women do it
3215794 but they cant not do it because they would go mad looking after children all day
3215795 so they feel they must do it in order to have a balanced life but it is very hard men still dont do their 50 percent at home women still have the responsibility at home
3215796 dont do whats expected of you if it doesnt feel right
3215797 the best way to interview men is to get them in a group and give them lots of alcohol and then they start talking and it really all comes out
3215798 they spend their entire lives trying to figure out women
3215799 how to get them how to keep them how to get rid of them when were sick of them
3215800 women are still better communicators because that was their job in the cave
3215801 men are still better at earning money in general because their job was to go out and provide the living
3215802 they didnt have to communicate they didnt have to have long deep and meaningful conversations it wasnt required of them
3215803 i grew up in an era that was incredibly permissive and revolutionary the pill feminists all came along
3215804 youre so lucky people of your age cant imagine what its like not to have birth control
3215805 not that im qualified to give anybody advice on anything

3215812 women are like tea leaves you dont know their strength until theyre in hot water
3215813 these are a good set of results against the background of the global credit crisis
3215814 our australian and asian businesses have performed well during the period with in particular our outdoor business being the standout performer
3215815 will largely depend on the performance in the final quarter where 33 percent of earnings before interest and tax traditionally occurs and there being no further deterioration in the new zealand trading environment
3215816 why are you wearing pink today when you know that lavendar is much more your color is that a tattoo near the left side of your d colletage cookie replied shabby that is a breast plate what is that on your face
3215817 shared parenting would mean that when both parents want custody there will be a presumption that day to day care will be shared unless there are good reasons why it should not be
3215818 but its put a massive onus on us guys who have been here a bit longer to step up
3215819 i think thats been the hardest bit for me being able to voice my opinion and not just be there and wait for someone else to say something
3215820 we just have to get out there and step up again like we did against the australians
3215821 it was a massive learning curve for us being beaten by so much in sydney and having been under a lot of pressure
3215822 obviously you have to do your homework and things like that and then you have to be on edge
3215823 its always easy to get up when youve got your backs against the wall that extra bit of excitement comes from being against the wall
3215824 ive been there a long time now its a great place for equestrian sports

3215826 i felt before we started i needed to make the most of the cross country day we needed a head start going into the showjumping something hes not great at
3215827 andrew was very unlucky we knew there were risks involved taking the direct route he made the decision to do so and if it comes off hes right in contention for the individual gold
3215828 the chance was there we gave it our best shot and it hasnt come off
3215829 everyone just has to go out and do the best they can
3215830 its a shame about andrew you cant help things like that happening shit happens doesnt it
3215831 youve got to have a go sometimes you just canter around for fun but thats not what were about
3215832 while in africa i met people from whom i could not be more outwardly alienated by color race language economics religion or geography
3215833 when i can use my training to help ease a suffering or prevent illness it makes everything that might separate me from the person i can help become irrelevant human suffering is universal any ability i have to reduce it allows me to strengthen the bond of humanity even a tiny fractional bit that should exist between all people
3215834 i tell you the key is to teach em tricks just like a puppy

3215840 meeting erica was a party by itself theres nothing like a meeting of the minds sometimes you feel more at home with someone youve never seen before than with people who have been in the background for years

3215847 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
3215848 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really

3215853 one of the sweetest most intelligent and perceptive ladies i have never met
3215854 erica has cornered the market on crap blogging in a highly disgusting but yet entertaining way
3215855 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
3215856 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
3215857 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
3215858 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
3215859 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol

3215864 frivolous shopping is off the agenda as most customers concentrate on value and durability and there are few signs the slowdown has yet bottomed out
3215865 some are shopping more locally for example or buying in season
3215866 the mixtape format is increasingly popular as a way of generating hype for hip hop artists hip hop mixtapes are usually sold on the street or through independent record dealers or mail order mainly relying on word of mouth to increase the artists street credibility an unsigned artist might release several mixtapes to generate buzz leading to interest from record labels while a signed artist may release a mixtape to promote a future studio album
3215867 bummer wish we could continue to support your artists but i guess we cant best of luck
3215868 hey sorry man my kids have to eat if youre never going to advertise with us i cant justify the cost of covering your releases
3215869 one of warner musics biggest mistakes last year was an album released by socialite paris hilton it sold just 13 000 copies a disaster made worse by the money spent on the heiress and her entourage she brought 14 people with her to the uk a weeks accommodation at the exclusive metropolitan hotel on londons park lane came to around 160 000
3215870 we should not be doing this job alone with cooperation from isps we could make huge strides in tackling internet piracy globally
3215871 employees of any internet provider who fail to store that information face fines and prison terms of up to one year the bill says the u s justice department could order the companies to store those records forever
3215872 in contrast to most portrayals as a lone renegade this one shows a more accurate scenario even though other label heads arent acting so tough theyre more than happy to let morris do their dirty work
3215873 speculation in the industry is that hell seek a slice of ipod sales apple declined comment
3215874 toronto police and councillor shelley carroll announced that people would be allowed to go back within several hours that is in fact what happened

3215876 i used to sing jazz while i was in high school
3215877 ive always loved jazz but i was told by people at record companies that i didnt want to do jazz for commercial reasons i sat in with cyrus chestnut one night at the blue note in new york we had fun and we decided to do something together
3215878 hes got a flavor of gospel in his music and hes very tasty he knows when to play and what to play i was mesmerized by him the first time i saw him he knows how to raise you up and back you up hes like an octopus on the piano
3215879 well be doing mostly standards ive always loved the standards
3215880 im attracted by all of the components that go into the songs the music the melody the changes the lyrics the subject matter i love the sophistication of cole porters writing i love the wonderful blues tunes like joe williams used to do and i love the old show tunes that jazz artists took and turned around
3215881 i would say if someone asked that im an entertainer
3215882 im a person that loves life and i try to get the best out of it i try to make a positive impression and help somebody along the way ive been blessed over the years i want to give something back i believe you have to
3215883 i eventually built a school in ghana literacy is the underpinning of success the school is teaching computer literacy health awareness aids prevention
3215884 im fortunate to be an entertainer and be able to make a lot of money and really not have to work that hard im not a one man army or a one man band but maybe other people will see what im doing and get involved in their own ways
3215885 i grew up in my grandmothers kitchen i decided to try my hand at cooking it didnt go too well at first

3215914 these deaths should not be considered an inevitable part of the teen experience

3215916 you have a responsibility to make sure your child isnt going to drive into someone else head on because hes busy chatting on his cell phone and nobodys told him hang up the phone and drive the car
3215917 we need to ease teens into a lifelong habit of good driving

3215939 gao is well known in the west a highly admired person and if anything else happens to him i think that it will contribute significantly to establishing the 2008 games in the minds of people as being the second berlin games of 1936

3215945 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia these actions would be inconsistent with assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring the status quo in south ossetia that existed before fighting began on august 6th

3215951 there are six long months of work in this research
3215952 some will be against this and some will be for it
3215953 this is the first time that such a widespread and critical attack has been demonstrated against nokias series 40 devices
3215954 we have proved that these devices can be hacked and infected with malware in a very similar way pc computers are
3215955 but in time people will be able to judge on their own whether we got it right
3215956 a cyber warfare campaign by russia is seriously disrupting many georgian websites including that of the ministry of foreign affairs

3216025 if the bottom line of parenting is grace then that should affect how you develop goals for your children how you handle discipline how you process their fears how you deal with their quirks and idiosyncrasies and how you respond to their fads grace keeps you from clamping down on their spirits when they move through awkward transitions and walk through the valley of the shadow of adolescence the reason grace makes the most sense as a bottom line for parenting is because of graces eternal appeal to the human heart
3216026 its hard bringing out the best in children when they seem committed to bringing out the worst in us
3216027 what is it about jesus that inclines us to cast our lot with a simple carpenter from an obscure ancient village its because of his grace grace he has shown us by first purchasing us from the depths of our lost condition its his grace that loves us when were being foolish or stubborn or selfish or mean spirited
3216028 grace can also help you know what matters and what doesnt it helps you give kids a lot of freedom to simply be kids and keeps you from living in a reactive mode as they go through certain stages without grace you can turn high standards and strong moral convictions into knives that cut deeply into the inner recesses of your childrens hearts

3216041 question obamas authenticity as an american she rejected that strategy
3216042 there are indications that john mccain may be adopting it now

3216062 not at the level expected from a silicon valley startup
3216063 only very large enterprises could afford it and it was hard to justify paying those prices for a product that simply automated what developers could already do for themselves with free tools
3216064 when i go into sites i would love to turn them on to the benefits of the testng test framework
3216065 but most organizations do so little unit testing if any that i stick with the simple well known xunit tools so as not to create confusion most organizations are just not ready to learn anything more than basic unit testing if that
3216066 the problem with unit testing is that it increases the cost of development before you know whether what you developed is what you needed afterwards when you have a working solution theres little interest in writing unit tests as what you have works and your management wants you to move on
3216067 many developers and managers mistakenly think that by cutting testing they well get feature x out faster what they dont realize is that you are robbing peter to pay paul
3216068 unit testing is likely to remain a niche solution found at organizations that really understand its value and progressively adopted by sites that can no longer stand the long debug cycles
3216069 the part that gets aggravating to me is that we went through an exhaustive search and tied up about four months to get down to two and then didnt take any action on the two that the council selected

3216084 in some moral matters the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
3216085 the morality of such questions lies not in what is done the moral object but in the motive and circumstances
3216086 a correct conscience recognizes that there are some choices that always involve doing evil and which can never be done even as a means to a good end
3216087 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
3216088 in light of the above it is a correct judgment of conscience that we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
3216089 what are we do do though when there is no such alternative because we have a moral obligation to vote deciding not to vote at all is not ordinarily an acceptable solution to this dilemma
3216090 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
3216091 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity
3216092 in some moral matters the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments

3216105 the bombs that are falling on us they have an inscription on them this is for nato this is for the u s
3216106 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3216107 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3216108 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed ten ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection

3216110 we believed that ultimately the third party chipset market would disappear
3216111 it leaves other third party chip manufacturers like sis with some tough questions to ask themselves
3216112 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
3216113 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
3216114 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
3216115 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3216116 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3216117 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses
3216118 so were getting to the sharp end of the development of the national registration system to be up and running by the middle of the 2010
3216119 it was agreed that queensland would be the host state which im particularly proud of

3216134 overall we found outdoor workers perceptions of their workplaces support for sun protection and other health related behaviours strongly influenced their personal protective behaviour
3216135 to foster a supportive safety climate skin cancer control programmes should also be developed alongside other workplace health and safety interventions
3216136 focusing on the damage that sun exposure causes to the skin and the eyes might help increase outdoor workers understanding of their personal risk
3216137 supervisors and forepersons also need to promote and support their use and set an example by their own practices

3216154 ketika ribuan umat islam bangkit mempertikaikan tindakan majlis peguam menteri yang kononnya mahir dalam bidang undang undang hilang entah ke mana ini amat mengecewakan seluruh ahli umno dan orang melayu
3216155 di mana zaid yang kononnya menjaga hal ehwal undang undang apabila majlis peguam secara terbuka cuba mencampuri urusan dan kepentingan umat islam di negara ini mengapa tiba tiba membisu
3216156 how a trail affects property values of course depends greatly on circumstances building a new off road trail in the city would increase property values as in part it is a recreational amenity but additional trails in the suburbs are detrimental to property values for example people who live in the suburbs would pay a premium not to be too close to a trail which might bring with it more people passing your house and is generally considered undesirable this should not be used to construe whether new trails are overall positive or negative just that they may have locally negative effects for adjacent and nearby property owners being farther from the trail increases property value so being nearer reduces property values all in all i suspect this is a relatively minor effect especially compared to the effect on property value of adding a bathroom for instance although some people may be dissuaded from buying property backing onto an off road trail
3216157 i continuously have clients that are looking for houses that are next to trails there are just a few subdivisions that back up to the mkt trail right now and i have a few clients waiting for these houses to go on sale
3216158 people like the trails for convenience being able to just hop on it to bike to work or just to get out and walk for exercise a lot of people who work at the university like to get on it and bike to work it just makes it easier for them to have that option to travel especially with gas prices so high its always been a real positive thing here but i guess i would assume some people might not want it because they think it might not be private but even houses in my neighborhood around the trails they achieve their privacy with trees and vegetation
3216159 communities that might be anxious at first usually find that trails bring a sense of community and security because they connect them as neighbors
3216160 youre watching to see the regular activity out on the trail what youre really doing is gathering up your neighborhood and offering a sense of community they really make the trail their own and owning everything that happens out on the trail people form trail watch programs with designated rangers or a friends group with people in the neighborhood who watch out for the trail and clean it
3216161 the wildlife in columbia are probably already accustomed to urbanization for the most part they are going to learn when people are on the trails and when people are not on the trails when people get a chance to be in the natural world so to speak the animals will adapt
3216162 animals are already familiar with human interference and theyve been able to maintain their habitats if i were living near wildlife i wouldnt be concerned about not hearing the wildlife once a trail is put in the local wildlife becomes so accustomed that they go about their normal business and its not a threatening situation for them maybe theyll go through a transition period with people coming through the forest but theyll learn it pretty quickly
3216163 we try to avoid removing as many trees as we possibly can when we put the trails in to reduce the impact on a particular site
3216164 we basically prioritize the stand when choosing which trees to take out youre not creating much of an impact as far as removal on any one particular species when you remove them you kind of weigh out which trees are more desirable and which we would sacrifice we will always try to minimize the environmental impact in an area thereby saving the more desirable species and we accomplish this by a slight shifting of the trail
3216165 its not only drinking its idealized drinking which is a very very bad message for the kids

3216214 we didnt call the police because there was a fight we called police because we just knew that it was different we were being cautious
3216215 we have almost no trouble at sturgis the people are so happy that you just learn to recognize when things seem a little different
3216216 there were probably 30 officers outside when it happened so the response was instantaneous
3216217 its difficult but people have to wait for all of the evidence to come in and the investigation is done and it will be obvious that he was defending himself
3216218 i didnt know until after the fact that their numbers are made up of police and firefighters
3216219 they were happy go lucky guys theyd been in there throughout the rally and just seemed like normal guys that ride motorcycles and were having a couple of beers and hanging out we didnt view them as any kind of outlaw motorcycle group we had not had any trouble with them whatsoever

3216228 pay no attention to those biblical glorifications of merciless slaughter and destruction behind the curtain the great and powerful i am not right up there in the bible interpretation bit
3216229 that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it
3216230 i came home in 1958 full of idealism and activism to discover that very little was being done
3216231 students were not taken seriously here before the civil rights movement and private money receded at the mention of a communist youth festival
3216232 far from being shocked by this involvement i was happy to find some liberals in government in those days who were far sighted and cared enough to get americans of all political views to the festival
3216233 i was never asked to report on other americans or assess foreign nationals i had met
3216234 the c i a s big mistake was not supplanting itself with private funds fast enough
3216235 to compete more effectively with this obviously successful communist apparatus
3216236 this is the first time commies have held one of these shindigs on our side of the iron curtain and what goes on how it goes on and what the follow up will be is i think extremely important
3216237 full of idealism and activism to discover that very little was being done
3216238 far from being shocked by this involvement i was happy to find some liberals in government in those days who were far sighted and cared enough to get americans of all political views to the festival

3216242 theres a kind of victimization with not knowing which way to go how you are supposed to be what to do in a relationship were in a double bind
3216243 i have tried to give women what they say they want but they always want something else women think that what they want is for the man to really talk and to be at home with the kids but she doesnt want that for long she wants a strong man
3216244 we end up relating to women in a way that is more like woman to woman not man to woman we are feminized in our relationships and they dont last
3216245 sex positive means that women get orgasms and men get to watch
3216246 unless we act quickly the gap between the haves and the have nots will grow uncontrollably exacerbating existing inequalities and condemning millions more people to poverty
3216247 now it is clearer than ever that the only way to end the gross inequalities that have condemned more than a billion people to linger in poverty is through a massive redistribution of power assets and opportunities
3216248 i think they should hear georgia will never surrender georgia will never surrender
3216249 the majority of georgias territory is occupied accused russia of a premeditated attack
3216250 once i had a chat with god but it was not really all that odd i said hey he said good day in a classic way
3216251 im here to pay tribute to such a great man and a great priest he was a man i have always admired over many years
3216252 was a great supporter of the timor leste in 1999 during the worst violence caused by militia gangs
3216253 we dont leave the philippines without paying respect and pray for him and to seek for his blessing
3216254 pray for us and to offer his outspoken support and he did
3216255 and songs about how he needs new toilet paper that doesnt cut up his ass so much but he we have what seems to be an ample follow up on our hands
3216256 but with me thats not the deal girl i say how i feel when i see something i like im gonna keep it real for instance you look like food i wanna put you on my plate sop you up with some biscuits and go on and eat you babe i can tell you make it rain grab my ears and pull my face tonight ill be givin you brain
3216257 we wanted to take a look at both of them on the defensive side of the ball and see if they would flash out at us and show us something
3216258 chandler did and matt didnt look like a defensive explosion type player
3216259 hes as strong as any freshman ive been around in a long long time
3216260 not at all because i want to get the ball back chandler burdens one of those guys that can help you get the ball back hes an explosive young guy already the strongest guy on the team he doesnt always know whats going on but hes always going full speed and somebodys going to get hit in the mouth while hes out there too
3216261 i feel like im pretty fast for how big i am
3216262 i might be a good offensive lineman but i think id use my assets better on the defensive line ive always been good at getting under people and getting them to stand up
3216263 the best move he has right now is running down the middle and taking the guy and putting him right back in the quarterbacks lap
3216264 if i got a chance to go back id go back to defense
3216265 but it really doesnt bother me that im over here now
3216266 why but i understand what theyre doing and ive got to help the team any way i can so now im just focusing on the offensive side
3216267 you move smith over to the other side and hes one of the better athletes there
3216268 thats where weve gotten better the last two or three years on the offensive line weve got more athletic ability at the positions
3216269 he hasnt knock on wood put the ball on the ground
3216270 thats the most important thing that the center has to do and some of the other ones have put the ball on the ground he really doesnt know what hes doing yet but at least hes executing the center quarterback exchange
3216271 our defense is playing really fast and thats a good thing for us
3216272 thats one of the things that were going to see in our league week in and week out
3216273 theyre timing up and disguising their blitzes really well and weve got to do things to change the snap count to try and help ourselves
3216274 those guys are running around flying to the football and having fun its only making us better were young and inexperienced and right now theyre bloodying our nose no question about that

3216300 a major financial player like j p morgan with the breadth and depth of its activities across the financial service sector will need to be active in washington
3216301 its going to be a very very busy year we might as well brace ourselves for it
3216302 it doesnt matter which one is president there is going to be a tremendous need for lobbying
3216303 theres a lot of talk about change in this election you have to get ready
3216304 we anticipate a much much greater level of activity than weve had in the last few years

3216311 they can call him easily and say you know we have a client interested in that congressional white paper on greenhouse gas emissions
3216312 wynn who declined to be interviewed for this column plans to begin work for dickstein shapiro in june
3216313 we are highly confident that wynn will conduct himself in the interim with the highest personal and political integrity
3216314 might advise him to stop voting altogether which would leave his constituents without a vote in congress
3216315 hes supposed to be representing the interests of his district
3216316 this is another example of the democratic majoritys disturbing unwillingness to live up to the ethical standards they campaigned on

3216322 we thought it best to withdraw from the account as the dramatic changes in pakistan impeded our effectiveness on their behalf
3216323 the contract for one year was still at the trial phase when during the course of the first month of association both the embassy of pakistan and cassidy amp associates came to the conclusion that the latter could not effectively implement the contract as lobbyist
3216324 as a result cassidy amp associates asked for withdrawal from the contract that the embassy has accepted
3216325 there was never any concern about our work expressed by the embassy
3216326 we work with the embassy to address legitimate concerns that have been raised in congress and recent actions by the government of pakistan
3216327 are shedding their reluctance and saying thats what i want to do to make a living

3216399 its inevitable that terrorists will infest america for generations to come its also inevitable that an anti gun president will occupy the white house and anti gun forces will control the u s house and senate

3216417 recent scholarship and jurisprudence have given welcome attention to the particular experience of black women in the workplace and have proposed remedies to address their specific concerns
3216418 the legal system has failed to provide parallel protection against the special features of discrimination against black men

3216424 many black men although certainly not all are more verbally direct expressive and assertive than white men

3216530 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the south ossetian zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3216531 there is evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3216532 the assurances we have received from russia that its objectives were limited to restoring status quo in south ossetia that existed before the fighting began on august 6
3216533 it now appears that an effort may be underway to depose georgias duly elected government russia has invaded the sovereign neighboring state and threatens the democratic government elected by its people
3216534 russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step towards resolving this conflict

3216560 nor do i seek to understand that i may believe but i believe that i may understand for this too i believe that unless i first believe i shall not understand
3216561 this is primarily due to the following factors income taxes go down after retirement social security taxes end completely social security benefits are partially or fully tax free and saving for retirement is no longer needed that said our 2008 replacement ratio study truly illustrates the importance of saving and the overwhelming challenges that lie ahead for those who dont save adequately
3216562 an employee with a typical 401k for example has to bear all equity interest rate inflation and longevity risk that employers used to bear so the bottom line is save
3216563 if youre saving now make sure its an appropriate amount based on all factors if youre not saving start doing so today its never too late to start saving but the later you start the more you will need to save to make up for years of not doing so

3216586 i would say it sometimes takes a bit of a crazy person to join the army or to want to be in the army
3216587 he was always willing to try something at least once whether it was a good thing or a bad thing
3216588 hed been in contact before with the enemy so he knows what to expect
3216589 he knows how to get through it and that sort of experience is very valuable for young ncos
3216590 unfortunately he seemed to scare more kids than he cheered up but hes a great guy hes got a real sense of humour

3216600 we expect the storm will exacerbate food price inflation which hit 45 percent in july and drove headline inflation to 27 percent
3216601 unlike the rest of the region where we forecast cpi inflation peaking in the current quarter we expect vietnams inflation to continue to accelerate
3216602 o allah i would like you to give me a bottle of raki

3216608 what is clear is that the extremes have been strengthened
3216609 were in the same position as before the referendum but more polarized and with more profound differences
3216610 the national polarization has never been as clearly demarcated as now
3216611 that is the question that will define the immediate future
3216612 it is time to deepen in a democratic way the transformation of the nation
3216613 engadget reports apple has readied a blacklisting system which allows the company to remotely disable applications on your device it seems the new 2 x firmware contains a url which points to a page containing a list of unauthorized apps a move which suggests that the device makes occasional contact with apples servers to see if anything is amiss on your phone jonathan zdziarski the man who discovered this explains this suggests that the iphone calls home once in a while to find out what applications it should turn off at the moment no apps have been blacklisted but by all appearances this has been added to disable applications that the user has already downloaded and paid for if apple so chooses to shut them down i discovered this doing a forensic examination of an iphone 3g it appears to be tucked away in a configuration file deep inside corelocation
3216614 we dont usually post about problems like this on our blog but we wanted to make an exception in this case since so many people were impacted
3216615 in mexico investigators have provided some tremendous leads to weapons trafficking organizations
3216616 we are still a very long ways off before we could create something to harness that type of energy
3216617 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then can peace come
3216618 on the face of it the government has made great strides they the tigers are really hemmed in this time
3216619 im just not sure the military progress can be translated into political progress
3216620 my wife is on edge from the moment i leave home until the moment i return
3216621 all these things need to be stopped the government needs to take action against the perpetrators
3216622 people are giving them the benefit of the doubt for now
3216623 the worry is that what seems like a passing phase might become a way of life
3216624 that could be very exciting im already planning an extra big turkey and more people coming over the crew and actors to hopefully watch it on television
3216625 deze vrouwen stierven doordat hun lichaam afwijkend reageerde op het prostaatvocht dat met het sperma meekomt ze kregen astma achtige aandoeningen raakten in shock en stierven

3216628 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3216629 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3216630 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3216631 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3216632 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3216633 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3216634 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3216635 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3216636 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3216637 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3216638 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3216639 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3216640 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3216641 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3216642 before john mccains tour of duty in vietnam he married carol shepp a model from philadelphia on his 23rd bombing mission over north vietnam in 1967 mccain was shot down and captured
3216643 left her 4 inches shorter and on crutches and she had gained a good deal of weight
3216644 in 1979 at a military reception in honolulu mccain met cindy hensley an attractive 25 year old woman from a very wealthy politically connected arizona family cindys father jim founded the hensley and company the nations third largest anheuser busch distributor
3216645 she was lovely intelligent and charming 17 years my junior but poised and confident i monopolized her attention the entire time taking care to prevent anyone else from intruding on our conversation when it came time to leave the party i persuaded her to join me for drinks at the royal hawaiian hotel by the evenings end i was in love
3216646 hillary clinton should take on obama in denver on the convention floor whats she got to lose nada
3216647 a sudden feeling of fear or anxiety that comes on suddenly is overwhelming appears to be uncontrollable and may seem to be unfounded
3216648 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
3216649 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3216650 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3216651 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3216652 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3216653 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3216654 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3216655 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3216656 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3216657 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3216658 treason fled before us for resistance was in vain while we were marching through georgia
3216659 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3216660 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3216661 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3216662 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3216663 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3216664 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3216665 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3216666 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3216667 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3216668 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3216669 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3216670 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3216671 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3216672 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3216673 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3216674 we must hang together gentlemen else we shall most assuredly hang separately
3216675 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3216676 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3216677 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3216678 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3216679 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3216680 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3216681 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3216682 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3216683 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3216684 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3216685 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3216686 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3216687 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
3216688 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
3216689 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
3216690 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
3216691 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course
3216692 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
3216693 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
3216694 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
3216695 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
3216696 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
3216697 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
3216698 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
3216699 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
3216700 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
3216701 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
3216702 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
3216703 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3216704 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3216705 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3216706 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3216707 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
3216708 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3216709 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3216710 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3216711 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3216712 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3216713 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3216714 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3216715 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3216716 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3216717 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3216718 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3216719 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3216720 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3216721 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3216722 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3216723 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3216724 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus
3216725 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3216726 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3216727 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3216728 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3216729 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3216730 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3216731 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3216732 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3216733 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3216734 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3216735 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3216736 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3216737 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3216738 just so you all know we did set a record
3216739 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3216740 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3216741 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3216742 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3216743 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3216744 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3216745 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3216746 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3216747 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3216748 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3216749 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3216750 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3216751 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3216752 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3216753 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3216754 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3216755 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3216756 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3216757 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3216758 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3216759 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3216760 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3216761 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3216762 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3216763 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3216764 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3216765 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3216766 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3216767 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3216768 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3216769 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3216770 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3216771 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3216772 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3216773 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3216774 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3216775 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3216776 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3216777 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3216778 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3216779 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3216780 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3216781 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3216782 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3216783 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3216784 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3216785 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3216786 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3216787 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3216788 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3216789 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3216790 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3216791 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3216792 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3216793 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3216794 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3216795 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3216796 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3216797 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3216798 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3216799 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3216800 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3216801 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3216802 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3216803 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3216804 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3216805 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3216806 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3216807 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3216808 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3216809 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3216810 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3216811 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3216812 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3216813 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3216814 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3216815 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3216816 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3216817 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3216818 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3216819 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3216820 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3216821 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3216822 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3216823 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3216824 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3216825 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3216826 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3216827 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3216828 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3216829 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3216830 if you dont take someones life your life would be taken
3216831 only through forgiveness could we understand what happened to us
3216832 i believe that each human life is valuable the way you live your life may be different but that life is still the same as yours
3216833 empire of debt the rise of an epic financial crisis
3216834 the honest truth is that we have too many people in washington living for today rather than saving for tomorrow
3216835 give americans a good talking to about the countrys sloppy debt habits
3216836 the american people are a lot smarter than people give them credit for

3216838 if a wall streeter is selling you dont want to be buying end of story
3216839 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3216840 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3216841 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3216842 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3216843 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3216844 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
3216845 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
3216846 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
3216847 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
3216848 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
3216849 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
3216850 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
3216851 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
3216852 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
3216853 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
3216854 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3216855 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3216856 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
3216857 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
3216858 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
3216859 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
3216860 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
3216861 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
3216862 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
3216863 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
3216864 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
3216865 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
3216866 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
3216867 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3216868 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3216869 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3216870 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
3216871 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
3216872 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3216873 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3216874 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3216875 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3216876 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3216877 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3216878 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3216879 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3216880 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3216881 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3216882 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3216883 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3216884 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
3216885 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
3216886 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
3216887 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3216888 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3216889 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3216890 kirkland the seahawks injury situation has gone from aggravating to roster altering because leading receiver bobby engram will miss six to eight weeks with a cracked bone in his shoulder and the contract of defensive tackle marcus tubbs was terminated after he failed yet another physical because of his troublesome right knee
3216891 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3216892 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3216893 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3216894 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3216895 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3216896 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3216897 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3216898 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3216899 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3216900 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3216901 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3216902 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3216903 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3216904 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3216905 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3216906 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3216907 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3216908 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3216909 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3216910 deliver exceptional asian dining experiences by building an organization where people are inspired to better their lives
3216911 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3216912 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3216913 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3216914 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3216915 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3216916 administrative office assistant 14 50 to 17 50 per hour
3216917 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3216918 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3216919 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3216920 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3216921 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3216922 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3216923 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3216924 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3216925 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3216926 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3216927 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3216928 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3216929 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3216930 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3216931 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3216932 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3216933 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3216934 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3216935 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3216936 the dancers are doing really well the men themselves are picking it up rather quickly theres going to be some really good competition this year
3216937 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3216938 oh my shes dumber than a bag of cat hair bless her heart

3216941 thou shalt not name a democrats party unless it helps you facilitate an attack on a republican
3216942 seems that there are more than a couple of folks taking notice of your postings tom excellent job i believe cleveland is better off because of the job you did
3216943 tom blumer at bizzyblog brings actual facts about coal miner fatalities to light and gives the bdsers a reality check
3216944 the best blogger in the state and a more talented natural economist than any of those pointy headed keynesian halfwits
3216945 tom blumer is doing stuff that msnbc and ap should have done before providing the teenager farris hassan a national international forum and 15 minutes of fame
3216946 guys like tom blumer cover what really matters and theyre independent enough to tell the truth without fear of aggravating corporate media owners
3216947 bizzyblog made my point with numbers and facts and stuff
3216948 this is why i read bizzy blog he catches the stuff that i manage to miss
3216949 i was talking with him gerrard this morning and he will go with us to belgium
3216950 he is progressing really well but we will check after training
3216951 i will speak with the doctor and with steven and then decide
3216952 people may say its a kind draw for us but we will treat them with respect
3216953 they have not played in the group stages of the champions league before so they will be keen to change that also they will have the confidence of champions after winning their title
3216954 liverpool is a massive club and were expected to beat teams so im looking forward to the challenge
3216955 i certainly am ready ask any player and theyll tell you that pre season is just about getting fitness now the real business starts
3216956 whenever liverpool were playing in the champions league or in a game which had no effect on tottenham id be cheering them on league is part of why i wanted to come here this is my opportunity now
3216957 for us its a milestone and opens a window to the past

3216969 ceasefire agreement is signed by two sides when they meet
3216970 georgian people will never surrender freedom and democracy because democracy is stronger than any of their tanks any of their bombings any of their brutal equipment
3216971 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3216972 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3216973 a war is underway and our colleagues need to listen before consulting with their capitals and making decisions they need to listen to each party

3216982 rusia ha encontrado en la ofensiva georgiana sobre osetia la excusa perfecta para actuar en defensa de los separatismos georgianos ante la condena internacional mosc puede alegar que occidente permiti igualmente la independencia de kosovo al igual que las regiones de osetia y abjazia quieren salir de georgia e integrarse en rusia
3216983 a ltima vez que eu enterrei 5 bolas em um jogo tinha 17 anos
3216984 i am confident about my squad and i am happy that we have the best squad since i arrived at anfield
3216985 the key is not to say we will win the title because the premier league is now the best and most difficult in europe
3216986 manchester united chelsea and arsenal are the best in europe but my belief is unshakeable that we can compete with them
3216987 i am convinced the frustration we got by not winning it last season will come out for good
3216988 it will strengthen our resolve to do it this time we have kept the basis of the team this season
3216989 okay we have lost gilberto who was very experienced and very important in the dressing room also we lost mathieu flamini and alex hleb but we brought in samir nasri and also we have many young players who are one year older and have learned a lot
3216990 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and now we want to continue we were a short way from winning the league and the champions league that is why we want to continue with the way we play and keep the belief
3216991 it is not possible to draw a direct causal link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts affecting species such as polar bears
3216992 we need a regulatory framework that is consistent with the esa and will address new challenges such as climate change
3216993 focusing the consultation process on those federal actions where potential impacts can be linked to the action and the risks are reasonably certain to occur
3216994 we are not being good stewards of our resources when we pursue consultation in situations where the potential effects to a species are either unlikely incapable of being meaningfully evaluated or pose only a remote risk of causing jeopardy to the species or its habitat
3216995 this operation pre dates project wickenby but it is another example of how the afp in concert with its project wickenby partners continues to focus on arrangements involving offshore secrecy havens and money laundering to ensure those involved pay their fair share of tax
3216996 i have large boobs and a sizable a so i guess the title comes with the territory but i just play tennis i always try to look my best even though its hard to look your best when youre sweating grunting and making faces i never look my best when playing
3216997 recalls variously the invasion of afghanistan the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and even the soviet invasion of georgia in 1922
3216998 this kind of brutal attack has happened before against georgia and against other countries that the russians want to dominate
3216999 russia has the right to intervene anywhere in the former soviet union
3217000 probably the best relations that have been there for quite some time
3217001 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3217002 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
3217003 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3217004 georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the combat zone
3217005 a lot of the commodity funds seem to be unwinding positions and us us dollars are getting bought at the same time as they are selling aussie
3217006 thats not provided a positive read for the economy that may have added an additional part of selling
3217007 do not compare me to jose mourinho i am not him
3217008 mourinho says he will win 10 championships but i am more modest than that
3217009 but i do want to make chelsea loved around the world like barcelona and manchester united its a surprise for me that people say chelsea are unpopular because when we went to china they loved us
3217010 there is no reason if all goes well that we cannot win every competition we enter
3217011 there are a number of people in custody and some are asking what am i doing here
3217012 i need to tell them something at the end of the day
3217013 for us its a milestone and opens a window to the past

3217015 we have to wrap up the question of qualification to the group stage at home
3217016 artmedia are a team that score a lot but we are solid at the back and im not worried

3217018 mencari teman dikala senang sangatlah gampang tetapi mencari teman dikala susah adalah sesuatu yang sulit
3217019 a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup i have got to be confident this team can defend their title
3217020 in a lot of instances we have this picture of private security as blackwater types ex navy seals but a lot of the contracts in afghanistan as i understand them are with local afghan companies
3217021 what youre really concerned about here is whos got guns and where they are
3217022 dnd should have a single point to co ordinate all of the dnd let contracts and it should probably be the same person who is co ordinating all government of canada let contracts in afghanistan
3217023 private security contractors are used for defensive roles primarily such as perimeter security at designated sites
3217024 clearly state that any use of force must be in accordance with applicable law

3217031 i dont expect it to be a dreadfully long time but i cant say when that will be completed
3217032 the problem with asbestos is that when its disturbed and becomes airborne it becomes dangerous to people
3217033 police are asking anyone who sees something that resembles asbestos or anything connected to the explosion to contact authorities rather than handle it themselves
3217034 7 12 6 in heavily populated or congested areas the authority having jurisdiction may determine restrictions of individual tank capacity total storage and parking of tank trailers or cargo liners distance to line of adjoining property and other requirements
3217035 last year we were in a very acute buyers market where there was really an extraordinary demand and a lack of supply causing prices to begin to go up that continued on for the rest of 2007 and the first part of 2008
3217036 it goes back to our economic situation here where our demand levels have grown were seeing newcomers and ex patriots moving back here because of job opportunities and looking for quality of life they may not get in larger centres so thats caused increased demand for housing
3217037 the situation were on right now weve seen a extraordinary amount of supply come on the market since about the middle of april its slowed the market down
3217038 we may see some fluctuation in the price but were not going to see at least in our estimation any retraction in prices
3217039 builders are facing much more competition from the resale market in regina active listings were up 85 per cent
3217040 in saskatoon the resale supply has more than doubled in one year last year we were looking at just over 800 resale homes instead now we have more than 2 000 listed so buyers have much more choice and instead of waiting to buy a new home they will turn to that market
3217041 the economic interests are very strong in saskatchewan we have positive job creation lots of job growth and the unemployment rate is still very low
3217042 we have to wrap up the question of qualification to the group stage at home

3217049 do you want me to tell you something really subversive love is everything its cracked up to be thats why people are so cynical about it it really is worth fighting for being brave for risking everything for and the trouble is if you dont risk anything you risk even more
3217050 what do you think about our next child coming from ethiopia

3217052 the ssl server credentials private key has the following properties
3217053 this result validates the prospect for economic production of pha polymer in switchgrass and demonstrates for the first time an important tool for enhancing switchgrass for value added performance as a bioenergy crop
3217054 simply stated the prototype devices were unable to consistently identify operating wireless microphones or distinguish occupied from unoccupied tv channels
3217055 more troubling the devices failed to detect the presence of wireless microphones when switched on an occurrence that takes place multiple times during any nfl game
3217056 theres no question that the geolocation technology that was tested is reliable
3217057 but on the sensing side it didnt always detect usable and unusable channels in different areas these results reflected what we saw in the lab under certain conditions
3217058 taken together these protection mechanisms remain technically unimpeachable whether or not the commissions current testing process produces adequate data to validate a spectrum sensing only approach
3217059 moreover no wsd white space device will or should come to market unless the fcc can verify that the device does not interfere with tv or wireless microphone signals

3217067 we are committed to tackling knife crime and getting knives off our streets we have introduced tough laws including increasing the minimum age at which someone can be sold a knife from 16 to 18 and penalties for shopkeepers who do beak the law
3217068 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
3217069 for some time police forces have been working closely with trading standards to address the illegal sale of knives to young people
3217070 police forces are determined to make inroads into stamping out knife crime and getting weapons off our streets but this cannot be down to police alone retailers must take responsibility for their actions too
3217071 operations such as this are considered good practice in tackling unscrupulous and irresponsible shop keepers who are willing to sell knives to young people with the full knowledge that these may then go on to be used as weapons
3217072 council trading standards teams are already taking a tough stance on shops selling knives to children and carry out regular checks to make sure retailers arent breaking the law
3217073 the legal age for buying a knife was raised from 16 to 18 last year and its important that retailers understand the implications of breaking the law councils arent trying to hoodwink retailers and will only use volunteers who look under 18 there is simply no excuse for selling knives to children and retailers must accept their share of responsibility if we are to keep our streets and our young people safe and free of knives
3217074 hello this is the operator please do not pick up the phone within the next 5 minutes or else it will emit an electric shock thank you
3217075 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3217076 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3217077 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3217078 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3217079 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3217080 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3217081 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
3217082 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3217083 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
3217084 you can never have a christian mind without reading the scriptures regularly because you cannot be profoundly influenced by that which you do not know
3217085 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3217086 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3217087 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3217088 its very clear that eliminating this protein has cardiovascular benefits
3217089 rna based drugs might provide a course of treatment for people whose cholesterol levels are resistant to current drugs or they might be combined with current drugs
3217090 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
3217091 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
3217092 the american academy of pediatrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run

3217096 my companys culture doesnt encourage the use of web 2 0 technologies
3217097 my company doesnt understand the potential financial return from the use of web 2 0 tools techniques
3217098 the it department finds and tests new technologies and then brings them to the business units
3217099 then he just grew up and decided i can do this
3217100 his father rick charlson said friday his voice swelled by pride and heartbreak
3217101 so he stuck it out i think now towards the end its just what you do he was very responsible
3217102 the morning he left he called at 7 05 or so in the morning he said what was going to happen he was excited hed never been in a helicopter before so he was really looking forward too that
3217103 we said all our i love yous that was the end of every conversation
3217104 he enjoyed being in the woods looking at stuff that was growing wildlife panoramas
3217105 he didnt talk very much about things like that he was really very private
3217106 he was always the kind of guy who could make you laugh even if something real serious was happening
3217107 he had had a knowledge for sports he really could have done something with it he would predict that somebody would get traded or this was going to happen who was going to be drafted first he would always know
3217108 i never knew him to read a book in the 25 years ive known him and here he is a journalism major he loved sports so much he knew who was on every team what trades were going i think he would have made a great sports analyst his goal was to write for espn or sports illustrated or something like that
3217109 so he worked in forestry because he could earn the most amount of money in one summer to pay for that
3217110 he had to borrow all the money for his own schooling we couldnt help him with anything
3217111 what a great honor for alicia as she continues to put oregon lacrosse on the map now at an international level

3217114 only sports widely practiced by men in at least seventy five countries and on four continents and by women in at least forty countries and on three continents may be included in the programme of the games of the olympiad
3217115 to be included in the programme of the olympic games events must have a recognized international standing both numerically and geographically and have been included at least twice in world or continental championships
3217116 only sports that apply the olympic movement anti doping code and in particular perform out of competition testing in accordance with the rules of the world anti doping agency will be included in the programme of the olympic games
3217117 sports disciplines or events in which performance depends essentially on mechanical propulsion are not acceptable
3217118 these guys have now committed to helping us but we dont know exactly how much yet
3217119 there is still another vendor interested in this and i would hope they would give us a better deal

3217138 american specialty health companies celebrated its 14th straight year of growth in 2001 the san diego based health services organization
3217139 with a little over 18 months left in his administration warner has appointed nearly twice as many hispanics to state boards and commissions than the previous two governors combined for the first time the latino community really does have a seat at the table and a chance to contribute to the direction of virginia the efforts made by governor warner to include latinos and other underrepresented ethnic and racial minorities in his government and in the political and policy decision making will no doubt be one of his legacies when he leaves office in 2006
3217140 g iven that clear legislative intent and given my support for legislation that punishes violent acts against women especially any violent act that results in harm to or death of a pregnant woman or her fetus i have signed these bills into law
3217141 governor mark r warner signed eight bills that significantly strengthen virginia s ability to protect its environment and to conserve its natural resources this legislation provides funding for the restoration of the chesapeake bay strengthens enforcement of environmental laws and rewards companies and local governments that have outstanding environmental protection records
3217142 i am heartened by todays rulings i come from the business world and i think most business people will tell you that they want to recruit employees who were educated in an environment where they were exposed to diverse people and ideas the court was clearly persuaded by the overwhelming number of briefs in support of diversity filed by business military and civic leaders
3217143 a s i have said many times in the past i believe race should continue to be considered as one factor among many and i continue to be opposed to the use of quotas
3217144 there wasnt a cohesive structure and one of the issues from the users point of view was youd have to log in to those sites from different ids there was no consistency with these all being a part of the ten brand
3217145 although we have used a reddot partner to initially implement it my idea was that we would eventually bring it in house
3217146 we can deliver these sites a lot quicker so we are down to for a largish site 3 4 weeks for that build test deploy phase
3217147 so where we have got a news item on a specific story and we have got video content we have actually been able to hook that all together in the cms and publish that out

3217186 we think fuel is expensive but for what you get the price that you pay at the pump is so insignificant to whats really going on
3217187 about 140 billion gallons of gasoline per year are used for transportation in the united states
3217188 and we can save about a third of that if we maximize our use of biofuels

3217213 this election is very crucial for the direction of the country because we still have differences of opinion

3217228 we have to take kashmir towards a solution there are two vital national interests of pakistan the kashmir and pakistans nuclear missile programme anyone who sells out either of these is a traitor
3217229 trust me let the talks begin and i will do my best
3217230 i am not deceiving you i will do my best to find a solution and if i cannot do something i will leave
3217231 there cannot be a solution which is not acceptable to all sides
3217232 only by standing united could we move towards achieving a solution
3217233 we have failed to achieve success and progress because of our failure to understand realities we need to face the facts and try to move towards a solution
3217234 whether we have made some progress on composite dialogue or not will be clear this year
3217235 we need progress in talks otherwise all efforts will go waste
3217236 the entire world accepts this fact and here in lies our success
3217237 my presence here reflects this commitment that we will not let their sacrifices go waste
3217238 we are at a stage where the sacrifices of 80 000 martyrs can bear fruit
3217239 we will have to leave our stated positions both pakistan and india will have to show flexibility only then we can reach a solution
3217240 if we stick to our stated positions we will not move forward
3217241 i have told the world leaders clearly that these have to be together and if not then we will go back to square one

3217253 reach will have a far reaching effect on any company that buys sells or uses chemicals

3217264 as the days got long there was always one thing that would brighten my day seeing the american flag

3217266 i understand this is your birthday weve come to celebrate
3217267 how much different will things be for iraq as a result of today
3217268 will the insurgents have a less receptive hiding place will ieds become less frequent will the children of this town be more likely to have a future with less hatred
3217269 somewhere out there in that chaos of darkness and light of science and protons of gods and stars and death somewhere theres an answer
3217270 it would not surprise me at all if this were to occur
3217271 yes we have no experience with athletes here but the treatment is safe and we can help you
3217272 it strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs it takes two weeks i recommend four intravenous injections 40 million stem cells or double that the more the better we also use human growth hormones but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list
3217273 i dont know how it was arranged or what level of hospital this was but it supports the idea that the world of athletics is very aware of gene doping and already pursuing it
3217274 there are interesting preliminary results but i cant expand on that
3217275 but were all encouraged by the results and wada very much wants to be ahead of the curve on this and has funded a dozen or more labs on gene doping
3217276 this is all very subjective but the hope is that it will be a fair process that will allow the athlete who has had gene therapy for legitimate reasons to state his or her purpose for it
3217277 the sporting authorities can then either accept or reject it
3217278 if gene doping is happening already as we suspect its being done unethically and with immature
3217279 so we will never again be faced with the situation where one state fails to pass on information to another and a doctor who is not practising well or who is practising beyond his or her level of accreditation will be pulled up very very quickly and wont be able to be employed in another jurisdiction
3217280 before the end of the year queensland will introduce the first piece of legislation which all other states and territories will sign on to as the first step to establish a national registration scheme for doctors and other allied health professionals including nurses

3217285 to make humanized animals really creepy youd have to do several things you increase the ratio of human to animal dna youd transplant human cells that spread throughout the body youd do it early in embryonic development so the human cells would shape the animals architecture not just blend in youd grow the embryo to maturity and youd start messing with the brain were doing all of these things
3217286 if you want permanent restrictions your best bet is the senator who tried to impose them two years ago hes the same presidential candidate now leading the charge against evolution sam brownback a kansas republican he thinks were separate from other animals unique in the created order too bad this wasnt true in the past and it wont be true in the future
3217287 were not doing these things because they are creepy were doing them because they are logical the more you humanize animals the better they serve their purposes as lab models of humanity thats whats scary about species mixing its not some crazy frankenstein project its the future of medicine
3217288 when stanford first head of the proposal for humanized mice brains they were grossed out but after thinking it over they tentatively endorsed the idea and decided that it may not be had to endow mice with some aspects of human consciousness or some human cognitive abilities
3217289 imagine that a hominid brain network you can treat like a lab animal because it is a lab animal
3217290 if something were half human and half animal what would our moral responsibilities be it might be immoral to kill such a creature its wrong to create creatures whose moral stature we are perplexed about

3217341 the one race we all do at the same pace is aging but where we can be an olympian in life is to make sure you stay active and enjoy your longevity more
3217342 i enjoy the running because it allows me the ability to enjoy the fresh air clear my head and feel better physically emotionally and mentally
3217343 what i am saying is that you are never too old and you are never too sick to start running
3217344 even for those with couch potato status now you too can become an athlete if you approach it with intelligence

3217383 i am confident about my squad and i am happy that we have the best squad since i arrived at anfield
3217384 the key is not to say we will win the title because the premier league is now the best and most difficult in europe
3217385 manchester united chelsea and arsenal are the best in europe but my belief is unshakeable that we can compete with them
3217386 i am convinced the frustration we got by not winning it last season will come out for good
3217387 it will strengthen our resolve to do it this time we have kept the basis of the team this season
3217388 okay we have lost gilberto who was very experienced and very important in the dressing room also we lost mathieu flamini and alex hleb but we brought in samir nasri and also we have many young players who are one year older and have learned a lot
3217389 we have made a big improvement from two years ago to last year and now we want to continue we were a short way from winning the league and the champions league that is why we want to continue with the way we play and keep the belief

3217395 our voters and edwards voters were the same people they were older pro union not all but maybe two thirds of them would have been for us and we would have barely beaten obama
3217396 at the end of the day you can play the what if game endlessly and you can play both ways you know if senator clinton hadnt gotten teary eyed in new hampshire i think senator obama would have won new hampshire and he would have been the nominee in january so there are a thousand different ways you can play the what if game but i do believe that the result would have been different had this become public a year ago

3217401 could he possibly be here for closing ceremonies i cant comment on that i dont know

3217407 it will provide the resources to connect the light rail system in a meaningful way throughout maricopa county

3217444 there were days when we got promising news and days when we got not so encouraging news
3217445 but we decided to stick it out until the end and it paid off
3217446 our motto was lets just go until they tell us to stop
3217447 there were moments where you were just being watched very closely
3217448 we still did what we wanted to do but i was hurrying it up saying come on come on lets go it was a subconscious thing

3217460 there is no question that georgia started this conflict with an offensive against the separatists of south ossetia because its entry to nato required a resolution to the problem but the disproportiate and continuing military attacks by russia appears to have united the european union and the u s in a call for the removal of russian troops
3217461 the fighting has now created a major refugee crisis that is spilling over to regional states
3217462 and a political crisis with fears that russia is trying to overthrow the democratically elected pro western government of georgia
3217463 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3217464 of course saddam hussein ought to have been hanged for destroying several shiite villages
3217465 and the incumbent georgian leaders who razed 10 ossetian villages at once who ran elderly people and children with tanks who burned civilian alive in their sheds these leaders must be taken under protection
3217466 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3217467 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century we have no doubts about it this is a deliberate attempt to destroy an entire country and change the regime
3217468 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis
3217469 we urge restraint on all sides that violence would be curtailed and that direct dialogue could ensue in order to help resolve their differences
3217470 the vice president praised president saakashvili for his governments restraint offers of cease fire and disengagement of georgian forces from the zone of conflict in the south ossetian region of the country
3217471 i appealed to their patriotism thats why i ran you want people who are running for the right reason
3217472 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
3217473 as you may know if a candidate fails to get at least 15 at a precinct caucus their supporters can switch and choose to caucus with those backing other candidates or declare themselves uncommitted
3217474 if the presidential caucus in iowa were held today please tell me which of the following people would be your second choice

3217479 theres a church in every village in the world the potential sits there like a sleeping giant
3217480 the new testament says the church is the body of christ but for the last 100 years the hands and feet have been amputated and the church has just been a mouth and mostly its been known for what its against
3217481 im so tired of christians being known for what theyre against
3217482 one of my goals is to take evangelicals back a century to the 19th century
3217483 that was a time of muscular christianity that cared about every aspect of life
3217484 im worried that evangelicals be identified too much with one party or the other when that happens you lose your prophetic role of speaking truth to power
3217485 and you have to defend stupid things that leaders do
3217486 politics is always downstream from culture i place less confidence in it than a lot of folks i dont think thats the answer politics is not the right tool to change the culture
3217487 what the church is for rather than what it is against
3217488 drive the issue of abortion like a wedge into the soul of the nation
3217489 its part of the fabric of cumbria and on those grounds alone it ought to be preserved
3217490 we have enough net licences this year for all the guys who were fishing last year
3217491 weve reduced the amount of time they can fish a bit so that we can let more fish escape to spawn
3217492 its very natural for them to get upset and annoyed if you try and put them out of business
3217493 i think the river eden owners association should meet the haaf netters and get an agreed policy and put that to government
3217494 we need to be cautious with what were allowing someone to do and at what point in their recovery theyre allowed to do it
3217495 to keep the brain stimulated but not enough to push it into overdrive
3217496 whether its pop warner football or soccer or high school teams

3217501 well the porch isnt useful anymore because its not safe so we have to change it but dont worry were building another porch and you can help hold that porch up
3217502 but weve always had this porch im not leaving this board
3217503 well you can stay with this board and be thrown into the junk pile and taken to the dump or you can stay around and be useful in the new porch
3217504 i dont want to be a part of another porch i gave the best years of my life to this porch i remember when this porch was new and i remember the storm of 98 and without this porch this patio would be a mess
3217505 look we know we still need a porch we just need to change it to make it work better
3217506 i cant change im a part of this board and thats just how i am
3217507 people with higher incomes devote relatively more of their time to work shopping childcare and other obligatory activities spending less time on passive leisure activities such as socializing or watching television which the respondents viewed as more enjoyable
3217508 when youve got people that are 30 year plus incumbents its smarter to sit on the fence than pick a horse that doesnt win
3217509 the big problem with don is that he used the money he was given for legal fees thats not why people contributed to him so that created incredible uproar amongst the money group

3217772 the research has identified however that victim safety may be compromised by some processes at these courts
3217773 these may be conveying the impression that family violence is not serious replacing charges with ones which are less serious may also risk creating the wrong impression
3217774 on the basis of one year reconviction rates the introduction of the waitakere fvc has not had any significant effect on family violence reconvictions the overall family violence reconviction rate rose by 4 percentage points after the fvc was established in manukau
3217775 the waitakere fvc has not been entirely successful in its aim to fast track delays were reduced initially at manukau but this had not been sustained
3217776 the evaluation indicates that progress is being made with courts that are dedicated to dealing with problems involving family violence while acknowledging the courts effectiveness can be increased by further appropriate resources and support programmes
3217777 the family violence courts are working well but it should not be assumed that a court process alone will ever solve a significant problem involving crime

3217797 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3217798 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3217799 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3217800 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3217801 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3217802 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3217803 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3218226 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3218227 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3218228 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3218229 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3218230 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3218231 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3218232 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

3218237 the use of diploma mills is exploding as the internet makes buying bogus degrees easier than ever before
3218238 more workers are buying these degrees because they are looking for an edge in the competitive job market
3218239 the accomplishments of the needleworker are evident in the pieces we have on display but it is even more fascinating to learn what these women endured and accomplished in their everyday lives
3218240 the focus of this exhibition gives us the opportunity to highlight womens craftsmanship while also admiring their personal role in the many changes taking place during the 19th century

3218245 it just gets said every week and you sort of get a bit sick of it in the end
3218246 theyre going to try to pressure us on our ball and going to try to get into me like angle in on me and the same happens on their ball
3218247 people dont want to see scrums becoming nothing do they they still want to see a bit of the good old stuff where two teams are trying to get at each other i dont think its cheating its just two teams going at it
3218248 di no a las drogas di s a la vida
3218249 its good for nothing except finding out that your boyfriends been cheating on your behind your back on manhunt
3218250 but its put a massive onus on us guys who have been here a bit longer to step up
3218251 i think thats been the hardest bit for me being able to voice my opinion and not just be there and wait for someone else to say something
3218252 we just have to get out there and step up again like we did against the australians
3218253 it was a massive learning curve for us being beaten by so much in sydney and having been under a lot of pressure
3218254 obviously you have to do your homework and things like that and then you have to be on edge
3218255 its always easy to get up when youve got your backs against the wall that extra bit of excitement comes from being against the wall
3218256 were going to have to win a lot of games

3218261 masyarakat indonesia mengkonsumsi susu rata rata sembilan liter setiap tahun per kapita tertinggal jauh dibanding malaysia 25 4 liter singapura 32 liter bahkan vietman 10 7 liter dan filipina 11 3 liter ini karena skala prioritas masyarakat rendah
3218262 we take a slight diversion from the normal big brother 10 chatter and delve a bit deeper into the world of bb with someone who has been doing this since season 1
3218263 we were tracking it earlier in that week and we knew that things were escalating
3218264 i can tell you it moved quicker than we anticipated that first day
3218265 we have an obligation to work diligently to minimize the impact on the academic program
3218266 when the state government says theyre gonna cut back they are fundamentally going to shift that expense downstream to us

3218268 free hugs see strangers can be nice to each other
3218269 there are four questions of value in life what is sacred of what is the spirit made what is worth living for and what is worth dying for the answer to each is the same only love
3218270 will she drop her dated look for a chance at love or remain dateless
3218271 it upsets me that we live right there and cant walk around a place we normally feel safe
3218272 we want a neighborhood that is as crime free as we can possibly make it
3218273 we all grew up in this part of town walked around the lake hundreds of times and this was too much for us to bear
3218274 under the circumstances its an increase thats pretty modest and fair
3218275 many people had believed that the seas were big enough to cope with any pollution caused by human activity
3218276 our view is he would not get a substantial increase to his sentence if any we are prosecuting all of these cases in the context of limited resources in the criminal justice system
3218277 while we understand the concern of the individual victims and we are concerned for the victims its a question of balancing all of the considerations
3218278 i lived there with ridsdale and there was not even a whisper it was a different age it was never mentioned
3218279 i was never chaplain to st alipius boys school or worked there

3218283 we worked to do it in five years and did it in four
3218284 the sustained increase in nih funding at musc during the last three years is particularly noteworthy because of the flat or declining budget at the federal level and serves as a solid indicator of the quality of programs as all nih research proposals are peer reviewed and rigorously evaluated
3218285 these achievements reflect the sustained effort of many talented faculty fellows and students and also musc leadership state support increasing program connectivity across the region and the many dedicated people in our research support units
3218286 serves as another platform for the areas growth in life sciences as new companies and licensing agreements spring forth from musc technology and research
3218287 an important mechanism for continued research growth at musc is the states centers of economic excellence program coee and the south carolina research infrastructure act that allows the university to recruit the best scientists to south carolina and create university based research centers in areas that will help grow south carolinas economy and create jobs
3218288 going beyond the ability to extrude these materials into high precision tubular geometries zeus is also able to perform full polymer characterization to provide our customers the necessary data to meet regulatory requirements
3218289 our team of scientists and engineers continue to excel in quintessential polymer developments our biomaterials platform is a keystone technology targeted for the development of a wide variety of medical products for both preventive care and the treatment of disease
3218290 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3218291 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3218292 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3218293 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3218294 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3218295 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3218296 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3218297 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3218298 on a great trajectory at least on the internet side
3218299 it shows that pagans who were a minority prayed in the center of the city and lived in harmony with the jewish majority

3218303 its a crazy way to make a living what we do
3218304 so many people think its like the life of a rock star but its not if you get into pro wrestling and dont honestly love it for what it is youll never last
3218305 because youll never be able to hack all the driving being away from your family and friends and the lack of pretty much doing anything else if professional wrestling is not your mistress and your passion you have no place being in it
3218306 is that how it is for you eric do you love it as much as all that
3218307 a wrestler was the only thing i ever wanted to be
3218308 the first time i ever saw pro wrestling i was eight years old and sitting in my living room in dodson new jersey i was completely blown away those men were gladiators superheroes and acrobats all rolled into one ive been hooked on it from that moment and there has never been a greater love in my life when im too old or beat up to compete anymore ill get a job in the business doing something or other just to be around it its the only thing that makes me truly and completely happy
3218309 in case anyone was curious yes i like the disco biscuits see i bought a hoody i wear it everyday
3218310 dude this crystal really works i was up all night last night drinking whisky and swallowing kolonopins but i got out of bed no problem this morning
3218311 aber der strand ist viele viele kilometer lang und tausende seesterne liegen hier
3218312 was macht es also f r einen unterschied wenn du dich abm hst
3218313 im extremely honored to be chosen for this spot i know i have a lot to live up to and i promise all the fans that i will respect and carry on the wetwerks tradition
3218314 i was such a huge fan of the band that to be an integral part of its success is now going to be very personal to me i truly cant wait to stand in front of everyone and show them what we are made of
3218315 i plan to work closely with the rest of the group of the next few weeks to bring myself up to speed with the workflow and overall process since i would literally play the recordings over and over learning the material is really not an issue at this point i want to get working a s a p im ready to go
3218316 the deteriorating economic condition is putting new stress on europe which seems to be even weaker now than the u s
3218317 some pessimists even talk now about the euro area breaking apart i would not go that far but we do know the honeymoon is over and this is the first real test of the marriage that we have seen
3218318 every two to three weeks the prices are going up we are buying less just like everybody else
3218319 we know this isnt going to be easy to bounce back from
3218320 our problem is that we adopted an american model of growth looking to services and construction and quick returns
3218321 it made us more like the united states and less like germany now we see that was a huge mistake
3218322 will provide clarity and certainty to the consultation process under the endangered species act
3218323 i am deeply troubled by this proposed rule which gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3218324 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government this is not the type of legacy this interior department should be leaving for future generations
3218325 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
3218326 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions
3218327 what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
3218328 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
3218329 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
3218330 because it is not possible to link the emissions to impacts on specific listed species such as polar bears
3218331 so we dont inadvertently have the endangered species act seen as a back door to climate change policy that was never ever intended
3218332 clarity on an issue that if it was left broad and ambiguous could be a serious problem for the home building industry here in california
3218333 for home builders clarity in the rules is always always helpful
3218334 encouragement from both sides of the aisle to see if we couldnt bring about steps that would make the endangered species act more effective

3218352 that this historic decision was based first as much on political expediency as on faulty reasoning of philosophy is shown by the part played by constantine the pagan emperor of rome who presided over nicea the growing communities of christians were a force whose opposition he had no wish for who weakened his empire and whose support would be invaluable in strengthening it by remodeling christianity he hoped to gain the churchs support and at the same time end the confusion which had arisen within it which was the source of yet more conflict within his empire
3218353 the church made religion not only independent of the scriptures but also independent of jesus so that the man jesus became confused with a mythological christ belief in jesus however does not necessarily mean belief in a resurrected christ whereas the immediate followers of jesus had based their lives on his example pauline christianity was based on a belief in christ after his supposed crucifixion and the life and teachings of jesus while he was alive was no longer important
3218354 they do blaspheme who say god is christ the son of mary but said christ 0 children of israel
3218355 christ the son of mary was no more than an apostle many were the apostles that passed away before him
3218356 they said that if he constantine did penance in their church his sins would be forgiven constantine made full use of this facility having salved his conscience with his confession the life to come ceased to worry him and he turned his attention to the affairs of the empire he saw the possibilities of using the church to his own ends provided that he could win its loyalty to him so he gave the church his full support
3218357 frame to thyself the form of a cross after the example of the sign which appeared unto thee and bear the same against thy enemies as a fit banner a token of victory
3218358 constantine the emperor fixing his whole mind upon such things as set forth the glory of god behaved himself in all things as becometh a christian erecting chruches from the ground and adorning them with godly and gorgeous consecrated ornaments
3218359 this same constantine who with his soldiers environed the bishops at the first council of nice a d 325 and dictated terms of the deliberations applied for initiation into the mysteries and was told by the officiating priest that no purgation could free him from the crime of putting his wife to death or from his many perjuries and murders

3218368 centralizing our critical departments and assets in combination with keeping up to date with improved security measures to protect our employees and clients data was the driving force in making this move

3218375 the americans were going to smash them thats what we came here for
3218376 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3218377 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3218378 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3218379 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3218380 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3218381 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3218382 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

3218384 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3218385 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3218386 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3218387 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3218388 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3218389 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3218390 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3218391 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3218392 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3218393 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3218394 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3218395 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3218396 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3218397 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3218398 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3218399 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3218400 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3218401 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3218402 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3218403 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3218404 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3218405 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3218406 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3218407 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3218408 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3218409 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3218410 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3218411 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3218412 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3218413 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3218414 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3218415 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3218416 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3218417 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3218418 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3218419 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3218420 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3218421 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3218422 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3218423 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3218424 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3218425 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3218426 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3218427 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3218428 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3218429 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3218430 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3218431 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3218432 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3218433 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3218434 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3218435 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3218436 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3218437 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3218438 who are open to doing something on the production side
3218439 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3218440 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3218441 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3218442 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3218443 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3218444 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3218445 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3218446 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3218447 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3218448 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3218449 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3218450 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3218451 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3218452 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3218453 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3218454 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3218455 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3218456 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3218457 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3218458 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3218459 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3218461 september 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the orion

3218463 having some number of months of schedule flexibility to meet our commitment in addition to having some number of months of cost dollars flexibility is key to keeping ourselves in a healthy posture
3218464 as we looked at the plan we had for september 2013 against the available dollars it became clear to us that we needed to adjust our schedules

3218476 an unmarried man can spend his time doing the lords work and thinking how to please him but a married man cant do that so well he has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife his interests are divided
3218477 the time that remains is very short so husbands should not let marriage be their major concern happiness or sadness or wealth should not keep anyone from doing gods work those in frequent contact with the things of the world should make good use of them without becoming attached to them for this world and all it contains will pass away in everything you do i want you to be free from the concerns of this life

3218480 seneca writes that women were married to be divorced and divorced to be married in rome the romans did not commonly date their years by numbers they called them by the names of their husbands martial the roman poet tells of a woman who had ten husbands juvenal tells us of one who had had eight husbands in five years jerome declares it to be true that in rome there was a woman who was married to her twenty third husband and she herself was his twenty first wife we find even a roman emperor augustus demanding that her husband should divorce the lady livia when she was with child that he might himself marry her we find even cicero in his old age putting away his wife terentia that he might marry a young heiress whose trustee he was that he might enter into her estate in order to pay his debts
3218481 some were not content to live their lives by their husbands side they carried on a totally separate life unto themselves
3218482 what modesty can you expect in a woman who wears a helmet hates her own sex and delights in feats of strength
3218483 she lords it over her husband before long she vacates her home flits from one house to another wearing out her bridal veil
3218484 while paul recognizes that some are gifted for marriage and some are gifted for the unmarried state no one is
3218485 for it is better to marry than to burn with passion
3218486 sanctified in this context does not mean that the unbelieving spouse is saved just by being married to a christian it simply means that they are set apart for a special working in their lives by the holy spirit by virtue of being so close to someone who is a christian
3218487 forgive me because today i did this xxxxxx and i know i shouldnt because xxxxxx
3218488 burning desire by marriage is good but there will be other problems life will not be a utopia just because you get married the distractions of the problems of marriage may hinder your service to the lord
3218489 paul will affirm celibacy but not because sex itself is evil as some of the corinthian christians were thinking instead the unmarried state can be superior because it offers a person if they are so gifted more opportunity to serve god
3218490 for the lord god of israel says that he hates divorce for it covers ones garment with violence
3218491 therefore take heed to your spirit that you do not deal treacherously
3218492 everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the lord and he delights in them
3218493 moses because of the hardness of your hearts permitted you to divorce your wives but from the beginning it was not so 9 and i say to you whoever divorces his wife except for sexual immorality or fornication and marries another commits adultery and whoever marries her who is divorced commits adultery

3218504 its notable that twenty years after putting its first pixels on the screen renderman remains the benchmark for all rendering technology
3218505 the fact that rendermans reyes architecture can now take full advantage of the performance offered by 64 bit windows vista and windows hpc server 2008 means that extremely large datasets impossibly large for 32 bit systems can be rendered this makes it possible to create images with incredible complexity and raises the bar once again for cinematic imagery and visual effects
3218506 rendermans widespread use among facilities whose reputation depends on creating consistently excellent imagery is telling
3218507 rendermans extreme flexibility quality robustness and scalability has made it the gold standard for film production

3218519 almost half the people who develop these tumours die from them and those who survive often suffer severe side effects from the treatment
3218520 improved treatments are urgently required but in order to develop these we need a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular origins of medulloblastomas
3218521 there was good evidence that either cell type could be the origin of medulloblastomas but no one considered that both sets of evidence could be correct and that these tumours could actually begin in two different cell types
3218522 identifying the normal cell that gives rise to a tumour is important because it allows direct comparisons between tumour cells and their normal counterparts so that key differences and vulnerabilities in the tumour can be identified
3218523 also recent studies suggest that cells resembling the original cell may persist in mature tumours and can be critical in ensuring its survival if so these cells would be an excellent target for treatment
3218524 it has always been thought that cells had to mutate several times before becoming a tumour
3218525 in this study we found that some stem cells only needed to mutate once
3218526 they would not turn cancerous immediately but once they had been given an instruction to turn into a more specialised cell the mutation would take hold and they would instead turn into a tumour

3218559 drilling in anwr would have little discernible impact on actual global oil supplies as its advocates well know the argument that it could nonetheless bring down oil prices is based not on hard economics but on market psychoanalysis drilling would send a message to the oil traders that more oil is on the way which would cause them to start betting down the price
3218560 such an effort should be comparable to americas concerted and internationally cooperative effort to defeat the axis powers during world war ii

3218772 but in recent years notebooks have matched most desktops and its becoming much easier to find a desktop replacement from every major vendor that easily outpaces all but the more advanced towers just three years ago the concept of a desktop replacement was a pipe dream back then the super hot components running desktops were incapable of running in notebooks while the industry was failing to address battery issues that plagued them and made them less than ideal desktop replacements but with the availability of intels core duo and core 2 duo chips all that changed power conservation became a key element in the newest generation of processor technology and that shrank the difference between desktop and laptop processors now the key differentiator between laptops and desktops is the number of cores and for most uses that doesnt have a big impact on performance unless more software is made that leverages multiple processing cores desktops will lose the major advantage they have relied upon to stay relevant

3218776 why isnt barack obama doing better why after all that has happened does he have only a slim two or three point lead over john mccain according to an average of the recent polls why is he basically tied with his opponent when his party is so far ahead
3218777 his age probably has something to do with it so does his race but the polls and focus groups suggest that people arent dismissive of obama or hostile to him instead theyre wary and uncertain
3218778 and the root of it is probably this obama has been a sojourner
3218779 for we are strangers before thee and sojourners as were all our fathers
3218780 this ability to stand apart accounts for his fantastic powers of observation and his skills as a writer and thinker it means that people on almost all sides of any issue can see parts of themselves reflected in obamas eyes but it does make him hard to place when were judging candidates or friends we dont just judge the individuals but the milieus that produced them we judge them by the connections that exist beyond choice and the ground where they will go home to be laid to rest andrew jackson was a backwoodsman john kennedy had his clan ronald reagan was forever associated with the small town virtues of dixon and jimmy carter with plains

3218990 they woke up this weekend and figured out that that ad resonated and they needed to do something about it
3218991 if the celebrity issue were not hurting them they would have ignored it
3218992 the details of mr obamas january fund raising illustrate just how much his campaign has been able to chart a new path for the presidential race he brought in 28 million online with 90 percent of those transactions coming from people who donated 100 or less and 40 percent from donors who gave 25 or less suggesting that these contributors could be tapped for more
3218993 if we can reach our goal of one million donors by march 4th we can send a powerful message that the washington establishment and big money interests cannot ignore
3218994 as one million people with one voice we can tell them that their days of dominating washington are coming to an end the old politics are crumbling and a new voice is breaking through

3218999 mr obamas fund raising dominance especially his announcement on jan 31 that he had raised 32 million has sent jitters through mrs clintons donor base
3219000 he obama reported donations from 100 000 individuals double the 50 000 people who gave to the former first lady more than half of those donors largely giving in small increments sent money over the internet the fact that many obama donors contributed relatively small amounts also means that he will be able to appeal to those donors for contributions later in the campaign
3219001 clintons campaign often solicited the 4 600 donations while obamas campaign focused on recruiting small dollar donors once again reinforcing the impact of frequent smaller donations
3219002 if you think you are too small to be effective you have never been in bed with a mosquito
3219003 raising money for a cause these days has become much like trying to walk up a
3219004 the problem is not that charities are not getting new money the problem is that theyre losing an enormous amount of money
3219005 of the donors who withdrew support 47 percent did so because they felt uninformed or unappreciated
3219006 if you think you are too small to be effective you have never been in bed with a mosquito
3219007 if you think you are too small to be effective you have never been in bed with a mosquito
3219008 they are looking for somebody who understands the struggle in the middle class who is championing the calls of small business

3219013 i dont know if anyone predicted that the entire voip industry would end up with business models dependent on traditional telecom revenues but it seems hard to deny with skype jajah ribbit and a long list of others chasing per minute revenues

3219018 let me just say that my office has received information of the airport trying to avoid the oversight by this committee but this committee and myself will not be detoured from exposing the alleged illegal activities as well as all the other alleged abuses that are happening at the airport

3219030 as an olympian myself i know firsthand that an athletes vision and visual skills are critical tools both on and off the field
3219031 vision is a critical component of overall physical health that makes a large contribution to overall performance after having worked with a number of elite athletes i am surprised how many are not seeing as well as they could at this level of competition an athlete should not be squinting to focus on a ball a hurdle or a teammate on the field if you are not seeing well your reaction time is slower and that may impact your overall performance
3219032 when you are training an elite athlete every aspect of their health and physical skills should be assessed and if possible improved it is natural to think of nutrition and weight training but traditional training is not enough anymore
3219033 scientific developments like the achievevision tm program developed by the vision care institute tm offer new techniques to help our athletes perform at their peak and allow coaches athletes and trainers to ensure vision is helping not hindering their performance
3219034 were honored to be entrusted with the vision care for the olympic athletes and team staff while they are in beijing
3219035 through the olympic village polyclinic johnson amp johnson vision care will provide the athletes access to best in class vision care services and products to help them maintain visual health during competition for some athletes who have limited access to vision care services this may be their first opportunity to receive eye care and diagnostic services which can have a significant impact on their everyday lives
3219036 i think manufacturers who make money should do all they can to make their products safe
3219037 this is just one step it ought to be banned for everything
3219038 it could lead to a blanket ban on some canned foods since their containers often have bisphenol a in their linings and parents might blend the contents to feed infants
3219039 many common everyday products could disappear from grocery stores all across california
3219040 we should definitely take steps to limit our exposure to the substance
3219041 anything we can do to reduce bisphenol a could potentially have big payoffs to protecting human health
3219042 im tense about it because ill be lying awake worrying about it all night ill be very tired by the morning

3219089 let your heart not be troubled neither let it be afraid
3219090 if you can hold off selling right now that makes sense
3219091 when i looked at this stuff a year back there was not a lot of pain in the upper price points
3219092 it is a little concerning seeing this spread of foreclosure into the higher price bands
3219093 the 575 000 home in castle rock sold for about 850 000 two years ago
3219094 if you try to low ball the bank it usually doesnt work
3219095 i think i should buy while prices are still low and start to build some equity

3219097 chfa views this as a positive sign that neighborhoods previously suffering from foreclosures are beginning to be re stabilized through homeownership
3219098 at least one buyer with a home due for completion and closing this fall was offered a refund of his earnest money deposit apparently as a courtesy since the neighborhood would not be completed by centex
3219099 the buyer was assured that centex would stand behind all warranties via its subcontractors

3219102 recalls variously the invasion of afghanistan the invasion of czechoslovakia in 1968 and even the soviet invasion of georgia in 1922
3219103 this kind of brutal attack has happened before against georgia and against other countries that the russians want to dominate
3219104 russia has the right to intervene anywhere in the former soviet union
3219105 probably the best relations that have been there for quite some time
3219106 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3219107 they of course had to hang saddam hussein for destroying several shiite villages
3219108 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3219109 georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the combat zone
3219110 russian aggression against georgia is both a matter of urgent moral and strategic importance to the united states of america
3219111 russian actions in clear violation of international law have no place in 21st century europe
3219112 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe
3219113 i condemn russias aggressive actions and reiterate my call for an immediate cease fire russia must stop its bombing campaign cease flights of russian aircraft in georgian airspace and withdraw its ground forces from georgia georgias territorial integrity must be respected
3219114 diplomats at the highest levels from the united states the european union and the united nations must become directly involved in mediating this military conflict and beginning a process to resolve the political disputes over the territories of south ossetia and abkhazia a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
3219115 september 2014 is when we are saying we will launch the first crew on the orion
3219116 its the unknown unknowns that we have to hedge against
3219117 having some number of months of schedule flexibility to meet our commitment in addition to having some number of months of cost dollars flexibility is key to keeping ourselves in a healthy posture
3219118 as we looked at the plan we had for september 2013 against the available dollars it became clear to us that we needed to adjust our schedules
3219119 all i can do is be me whoever that is
3219120 rebuild fiji into a non racial culturally vibrant and united well governed truly democratic nation
3219121 im very happy to be staying at the club for an additional two years

3219123 to get a further two years to work with the squad that weve got and the young players coming through i couldnt be more pleased

3219125 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3219126 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3219127 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3219128 pera dr health todo mundo t careca de saber como que usa
3219129 uma vez em s o paulo fui s compras com a m e dele e mais tarde vim a saber que enquanto isso ele estava com a minha namorada
3219130 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3219131 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3219132 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3219133 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3219134 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3219135 i dont know what i did but its been rough
3219136 it kind of hooked my right leg went up and then my left leg and i thought i cleared it
3219137 then bam it smashed right on the top of my foot
3219138 hopefully in four weeks ill be able to be running and doing everything
3219139 ill have a little bit of time to help in some type of capacity at least i hope so
3219140 i dont think anyone wants to play more than michael cuddyer its been a tough year and this injury is just another one of those things
3219141 every time im on the field and someone is hurt you hope they stay around because were a team
3219142 were a family and if your brother or sister gets sick you dont leave them you hang around thats the way i look at it
3219143 were in a pennant race having fun so its good for me to be here
3219144 other than obviously being around my family my wife and son its kind of therapeutic as well
3219145 what really means the most is the relationships with people like john smoltz and tom glavine
3219146 i wouldnt trade those memories for anything i met some wonderful people some of whom are in the hall of fame some of whom never made it to the major leagues but all quality people and its been a tremendous amount of fun
3219147 instead of saying goodbye ill say thanks for letting us be a part of your life
3219148 there wasnt anybody like skip he didnt sugarcoat anything he just told it like it was he truly brought the game into your living room
3219149 he liked cocktails and dinner cocktails and dinner and cocktails and dinner

3219154 its up to them if they dont call down they dont call down but im ready
3219155 before the all star game it was feeling like i had a tiny bit of tendinitis if i wouldve just thrown regular at the all star game like a normal up and in inning it probably would have gone away because i had the other three days off over the break i dont want to say the all star game caused it to be bad but obviously it didnt help
3219156 35 000 50 000 a show when tori found out her former co stars were getting paid way more than she was she got pissed and demanded equal pay but the network suits have refused

3219159 has been giving obama advice on things such as presentation public speaking and body language

3219165 athletes have to use every tool at their disposal to be the best they can be thats exactly what i was doing when i was an athlete
3219166 many athletes are surprised that one of the tools they rely on the most their vision is not 100 percent effective and they find they needs lenses or corrective surgery to make the most out of their skills
3219167 sports vision training and testing are very important to performance and can help athletes improve other skills as well the faster they can process the information the better they are able to use it on the field of play
3219168 if i can improve these skills i can worry about something else i can control
3219169 its going to help me train better and be more skillful
3219170 its her opinion that she is throwing the javelin farther and she clips hurdles less often because she can better judge the spaces
3219171 we think were getting an advantage over the other countries and thats great
3219172 if i can get that split second advantage on my opponent because my eyes work so well i can get that 200 mph smash back
3219173 seven hundred athletes have gone through the program with 50 of them fitted for contact lenses
3219174 in 2006 they again floated the idea across the negotiating table but we did not comment
3219175 unless the milf renegades will comply to leave peacefully we shall continue with our clearing operations amid our intensified operations we will not compromise the lives of the civilians residing in the affected areas
3219176 it is very clear our operations are focused in north cotabato it is not widespread and simultaneous ops against all other base commands of the milf that has been made clear
3219177 we have to again urge the milf forces to rein in their forces control so that peace will reign in those areas not only in north cotabato but the rest of mindanao
3219178 we need to focus our efforts where they will do the most good
3219179 it is important to use our time and resources to protect the most vulnerable species it is not possible to draw a link between greenhouse gas emissions and distant observations of impacts on species
3219180 this proposed rule gives federal agencies an unacceptable degree of discretion to decide whether or not to comply with the endangered species act
3219181 eleventh hour rulemakings rarely if ever lead to good government
3219182 if adopted these changes would seriously weaken the safety net of habitat protections that we have relied upon to protect and recover endangered fish wildlife and plants for the past 35 years
3219183 we believe federal action agencies will err on the side of caution in making these determinations
3219184 where we know we dont have a negative effect on the species but where the agency is vulnerable if we dont complete a consultation
3219185 we will not do anything that leaves the public out of this process
3219186 some of the most valuable and powerful tools to conserve listed species
3219187 we have always had concerns with respect to the need for streamlining and making it a more efficient process
3219188 this proposed regulation is another in a continuing stream of proposals to repeal our landmark environmental laws through the back door
3219189 if this proposed regulation had been in place it would have undermined our ability to protect the bald eagle the grizzly bear and the gray whale
3219190 there is no way they can rubber stamp everything because they will end up in court for every decision
3219191 this is the fox guarding the hen house the interests of agencies will outweigh species protection interests
3219192 what they are talking about doing is eviscerating the endangered species act
3219193 it shows that pagans who were a minority prayed in the center of the city and lived in harmony with the jewish majority

3219195 we are much ahead of schedule and the runway will be operational a good eight months before its deadline
3219196 cisf has earmarked places where it would like 11 towers it will be taking over the security of the area very soon last saturday senior officials of the directorate general of civil aviation and airports authority of india came down for a surprise check and were satisfied with the preparations
3219197 while this may not have a direct impact on flights we are expecting visibility to start decreasing on the runway by end september when it would have stopped raining and pollution levels in the city would go up
3219198 at present a connecting taxiway between the main and new runways has been built towards the dwarka side another one towards vasant kunj is being planned for later years

3219218 i was so in awe of everything very nervous and like my brother deacons felt the holy spirit upon me
3219219 i felt a special closeness with the holy spirit during the moment of ordination when in silence bishop edward k braxton placed his hands on my head it is a moment that i will always remember i live in hope that this closeness will always be with me
3219220 during the rite of ordination bishop braxton placed his hands on the head of each man
3219221 imposed his hands on my head i could feel the holy spirit infusing me flooding me with a warm loving soulful embrace i knew at that moment that all the training prayer and preparation had led me to accept willingly this blessed moment
3219222 one of the most moving parts of the ceremony was the laying on of hands
3219223 nudging me forward this journey to the diaconate has been a happy one the tasks the time the struggles have all led to an inner peace closeness to god i know that god has called me and now i can better appreciate and understand the words from scripture that says lord you have given me a task that is easy a burden that is light it was a wonderful experience laying there as if alone in the presence of god
3219224 as i lay prostrate i allowed myself to be with the entire community of the saints where i felt a love and an acceptance it was a moving experience for me
3219225 i felt all the anxiety and fear float away and this calm came over me hearing their names was like each saint speaking to me and blessing me
3219226 as i reflect on the ordination celebration i am so grateful to god for the encouragement prayers and support of all our family members friends and parishioners who continue to share in our ministry and faith journey we are truly blessed
3219227 the grace of god flowed on everyone there not just those of us becoming deacons
3219228 each year for the past three years members from the community have gathered together to host this end of summer event aimed at spreading unity and connecting los angeles black same gender loving community
3219229 while this event will raise funds for and honor members of l a s black gay community all are invited to attend in the name of unity in our community
3219230 with proposition 8 on the ballot in november and outsiders coming into our community in an effort to turn us against each other its more important than ever that we stand as one united community against discrimination of any kind

3219235 the spirit of 8 8 88 must never be allowed to die
3219236 we felt that there was no justice or freedom so we decided we had to bring about an uprising that would end single party rule
3219237 we called for democracy but none of us knew what it meant at the time
3219238 we had to look it up in the dictionary but we knew we wanted freedom and an end to military repression
3219239 many bodies were quietly cremated so that there was no evidence of the massacre
3219240 what is certain is that change will only come from within the country
3219241 we were on the brink of giving into the protesters
3219242 if the demonstrations had gone on for another two weeks we would have been forced to give up and withdraw back to the barracks
3219243 you can expect spontaneous demonstrations against the military but the problem is that you have to be organised
3219244 my concern is whether it can lead to a genuine political change
3219245 it is in times of uncertainty that protest and change seem to happen in burma
3219246 the next two years are likely to be volatile with more protests led by the monks and the students are almost certain
3219247 i feel like nancy pelosi as the democratic leader has failed our country miserably funding for more war

3219298 i got good pitches to hit and took advantage of mistakes
3219299 verlander usually owns me but tonight he got his pitches up
3219300 the last outing the 130 pitches no doubt in my mind led to tonight
3219301 theres no doubt in my mind he just didnt have it it was kind of a dead arm night for him and it was certainly related to the 130 pitch outing thats why i got him out real early just to freshen him up for his next start
3219302 we pitched well got the key hit when we needed it and played solid defense
3219303 this was the kind of game you want to play about 95 times a year
3219304 finding six talented actors who can portray supernaturally beautiful talented vampires of the sort stephenie meyer has created and her fans have come to know and love was not an easy task but we are happy to say we have found our perfect cullen family
3219305 director catherine hardwicke is keen to find the right teenager for the role of jacob
3219306 besides being an authentic native american he needs to have charm and charisma at this point catherine is more concerned about finding someone with the right looks and personality than she is about prior acting experience and he needs to be available for sequels this will be an amazing opportunity for one lucky teenager
3219307 it is always a challenge to find the right actor for a part that has lived so vividly in the imaginations of readers but we took the responsibility seriously and are confident with rob pattinson that we have found the perfect edward for our bella in twilight
3219308 we at summit are truly excited about the franchise potential of this remarkable romeo and juliet story of course you are only as good as your juliet and kristen stewart has that magical combination of being a great actress deeply appealing and perfect for the part
3219309 with drug costs escalating high above the rate of inflation for the last decade i think it only makes sense to look at different ways that we can control drug costs without sacrificing patient care

3219314 having dated a number of russian women and become intimately familiar with their naturally scheming ways i can speak with a degree of expertise on geopolitical matters that involve russia as a central player first understand mother russia theyre a country of thugs smart conniving thugs always looking for an edge but thugs nonetheless that is why they easily succumb to the siren song of communism controls their worst instincts and that is why their women 1 are so fatalistic and 2 respond so well to male dominance and abusive relationships
3219315 shippie you are somewhat right hemisphere dominant and have a strong visual preference a blend of characteristics which typically apply to persons with an
3219316 to be moved by a trait in another person you must have that quality inside of you as a possibility
3219317 but really you would laugh if you knew my dentist
3219318 if i put a quote of someone elses thoughts am i not in essence conforming
3219319 i have a mustard seed and im not afraid to use it
3219320 no i think i am right about this and i will not listen to authority

3219324 the second was the thought wow it was even worse than id imagined the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men surprisingly clinton herself when pressed was her own shrewdest strategist a role that had never been her strong suit in the white house but her advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution major decisions would be put off for weeks until suddenly she would erupt driving her staff to panic and misfire
3219325 above all this irony emerges clinton ran on the basis of managerial competence on her capacity as she liked to put it to
3219326 now when we play it is really crowded with people doing different things
3219327 we dont have space to do what we want like train or practice for baseball
3219328 if teams dont have space we will try to accommodate them we just opened two new fields in ps 29 in melrose which doesnt have too many permitted teams
3219329 the main issue is taking away parkland but since the elected officials gave it away the people have no say
3219330 ive seen really good players turn bad and go down the other road when we had our space so that can happen to kids who are not doing anything
3219331 thats the only skate park i know in the bronx i dont want to go really far away to go to another skate park

3219360 all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia
3219361 in the middle of an international crisis in which people are getting killed the best obamas campaign comes up with is to cast aspersions on a mccain staffer
3219362 we need somebody like senator mccain who will take a stronger view a more experienced view when it comes to international security and protecting americas interests

3219372 its entertainment thats set up by people who are high minded enough to not be racist or offensive
3219373 the whole film is based on the idea that what we actors do at some level is offensive and who we are at some level is despicable and pathetic which is the truth and not the truth but the part of it that is the truth is entertaining
3219374 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3219375 the size and discount of that type of deal isnt the norm yet
3219376 the critical mass of bulk reo is in well capitalized institutions that dont need to sell yet in bulk at a deep discount because they are better off not taking substantial hits to the capital just to get the assets off their books
3219377 this type of bulk buy would make an impact on the market they are in a unique position because they have a long time horizon to invest and a cheap cost of capital its actually a perfect time for them to acquire these reo assets
3219378 i told you to wait til in the morning i told you not to go back to jackson tonight thank god shes ok

3219381 we are asking people not to go to the movie and hope to bring a consciousness to people about using derogatory words about this population
3219382 we will continue to be vocal about the destructive effect of this film

3219385 if you re not a teenage girl than chances are that you probably have no idea what twilight is
3219386 omg this movie is the best movie evar u have 2 go see it
3219387 if your not a teenage girl then the chances are that you have probably no idea what twilight is
3219388 oh and twilight is not the new harry potter twilight is for more of an older crowd
3219389 oh i like the twilight books theyre good harmless fun with overbearing fluffiness we cant get enough of but its cliched has an over used plotline teenage angst with no complex material similar to harry potter
3219390 let me just point out real fast that everyone who says they love the book has read it and everyone who has said otherwise has not i dont know about you but that tells me something id like to see someone who has read it and doesnt like it but im not sure they exist
3219391 speaking of twilightmoms com i m guessing these moms are the same ones that like to dress like their kids and buy them all of the latest hot outfits you know the ones who throw parties for their little angels and have myspace accounts and have all of their daughter s friends numbers on speed dial
3219392 how can you compare cherry pie to filet mignon they are too different
3219393 this is one of the most amazing pieces of literature i have ever read
3219394 it sounds more like the covenant than romeo and juliet
3219395 will the twilight film be just as popular as harry potter
3219396 oh no the audiance of this book is primarily young teenagers blah blah blahhh
3219397 wow that was an awesome movie i wonder where they got the idea to do something like that
3219398 if you re not a teenage girl or a mother than chances are that you probably have no idea what twilight is
3219399 wow there are a lot of comments on this page
3219400 this book is targeted towards young hormonal female brats and older women who have no life
3219401 but i still stand by the fact that most twilight fans fall into the teenage female demographic
3219402 omg omg omg i love this book sooo much it makes me want to cry
3219403 i luvvvv edward cullin hes so hot and so romentic
3219404 why didnt anyone die come on now i have to wait through the whole book

3219412 at 13 youre not old enough to grasp this story dont get mad when i was 13 i thought i knew everything too
3219413 id like to see you write a story thats so much better
3219414 im 23 and have been a bookworm all my life and have been reading tons of books since you were in utero
3219415 she puts you in bellas mind makes you feel for her cry with her she is an amazing writer a phenomenal talent and you are a little girl
3219416 of course word of mouth has helped with its popularity
3219417 that refutes your statement of how poorly written it is
3219418 readers have spread the word to read this book b c they love it and want everyone to experience the world sm created and sucked us into
3219419 i know some teens may be like omg edward is so hot read this but thats not all of it
3219420 i got swept up in this story i lived and breathed it after i read it and if you didnt feel that way im sorry honey
3219421 and have at least gotten through high school english lit
3219422 reread it and i hope you love it like most everyone that has read it
3219423 i love twilight and all but harry potter is un believeablely good harry potter is my one eathly love no boy will every be that good to replace that series
3219424 i know 3 things first edward is a vampire second one of his sides would die to drink my blood and thirtd im totally and really inlove with him
3219425 if you are a teenage girl you probably dont know what twilight is
3219426 will this be the next big thing in the entertainment world
3219427 larry kings usa today column a weekly offering studded with plugs superlatives and dropped names all usually in close proximity to one another will cease publication at the end of this month
3219428 for my money theres no better movie out now than raiders of the lost ark
3219429 frank sinatra and the rat pack were some of the best entertainers to grace the stage

3219432 but you have to give him credit he is very very good at what he does

3219435 seeing how it worked out it was still a bit too bright compared to the actual fireworks
3219436 but most of the audience thought it was filmed live
3219437 a recycling of the rubbish of fake classical culture tradition a sacrilegious visual garbage dump and an insult to the spirit of liberty low class sound play thats just noise pollution
3219438 a showcase of the reincarnation of the marxist imperialism the ultimate paragon of an all embracing culture of fascist totalitarianism an encyclopaedia that encompasses total defeat in intellectual spirit
3219439 lindsay and sam sat down with friends and ordered dinner when someone who looked like the chef or owner came up
3219440 remember it was the democrat party that opposed the abolition of slavery
3219441 he tweaked it a little bit in the game did something
3219442 i suppose theres a chance but we havent even talked about it yet
3219443 now look it if you ask matt hell give you the history of his back since he was 11
3219444 bobby is a very important part of what we do offensively
3219445 the young uns have to step up and play weve said that already and now they just have to do it for a while
3219446 no way did he think he was going to be in this position six months ago and now here you are
3219447 who knows he might be the starting center on opening day
3219448 now even if i wanted to go a different way you cant mess around because we will have two receivers who are going to be on the roster who will not be playing
3219449 yeah ive got a lot of questions first of all how dare you
3219450 when georgians gathered here 16 years ago this square had a different name
3219451 the soviet army crushed that day of protest but they could not crush the spirit of the georgian people
3219452 its particularly a moment where john mccain can claim to have been prescient
3219453 appears to have been ahead of the curve in his assessment that moscow was the bad actor here
3219454 its not just this part of the world but senator mccain has been to so many exotic places like waziristan and south ossetia and hes very comfortable with these issues he knows what he thinks
3219455 certainly their initial responses they were as you say different mr obamas initial response was to say that both should show restraint the invader and the invaded thats not whats going on here
3219456 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
3219457 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
3219458 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
3219459 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
3219460 this is the great moral test of our generation are we actually going to leave this planet and america better for our children than we found it
3219461 why have we not addressed the issue of climate change and global warming
3219462 ill tell you why no question about it oil companies gas companies power companies and the lobbyists in washington d c we have to have a president who will stand up to these people
3219463 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
3219464 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
3219465 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
3219466 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because
3219467 coach from men to a real man this is for you
3219468 i expect not to know what to expect and how its going to be like
3219469 i know ill get the jitters a little bit when i go out there because this is my first experience
3219470 this advice on demos is almost a verbatim lift from a piece i wrote over 10 years ago
3219471 our original tips were in a slightly different order the first tip was the same we put the taboo about powerpoint in at 2 etc but we covered every one of these points in the written piece which was on the demo web site for three years in our coaching sessions for demo demonstrators and in articles published in a range of magazines of the 2 200 or so words you included in your blog 1 893 were directly lifted from our piece
3219472 her comment here represents her own opinion and claims not that of demo
3219473 the accusations were made in demos name from a former partner of the event at the very least release the document in question
3219474 yes lets see a side by side comparison asap im a life long journalist and everything i write is 100 percent from my brain or attributed this piece i wrote while doing 200 or so interview s for the techcrunch50 event
3219475 the ukrainian government which has been enthusiastically arming georgian troops from top to bottom was in fact encouraging georgia to attack and carry out ethnic cleansing in south ossetia
3219476 i dont have nothing to prove ive already done my job you can check my numbers with all the third baseman in baseball right now and you can see for yourself
3219477 i dont care what people say people talking about that can kiss my butt thats what i say people dont say that i was going to hit 20 home runs people didnt say kevin millar was going to hit 20 homers they didnt say aubrey huff was going to hit 300 what are they going to say now
3219478 its the same thing ive been doing from the beginning
3219479 the only thing is they havent been catching my ball thats it when i was hitting in the 090s i was doing the same thing when i hit 340 in 2004 i was doing the same thing i havent changed a thing i knew i could do better if my body feels good

3219486 grave mistake in appointing such a polarizing controversial figure to the highest ranking position in the school department
3219487 it was peter who first promoted mario cirillo to principal and then to assistant superintendent of schools
3219488 peter calls mario an outstanding educator a real leader and says mario works hard peter says he has tremendous respect for mario and that hed be terrific in east providence
3219489 first the responsibility for hiring superintendents of schools rests with the school committee which evaluated candidates and chose dr cirillo as the interim sen mouras letter prompted me to inquire into dr cirillos background i find that his record is one of excellence beginning with his graduation magna cum laude from springfield college
3219490 found a politically charged atmosphere and a teachers union whose senior officials were used to getting their own way child centered personnel decisions such as reassigning a teacher to a school with increased enrollment were met with militant opposition
3219491 they soon began urging his ouster and recruited a few school committee and town council members to their cause dr cirillo continued to push for change and succeeded in much despite the union hostility as for charges of overspending the record shows surpluses and the lower test scores they improved or remained constant and administrative salary increases were standard and limited to 2 percent per year
3219492 yes he has a right to his opinion but lets get the conflicts of interest out on the table school superintendents who have the temerity to stand up to the teachers unions are not popular with the labor union movement no surprise there
3219493 a leader who puts the kids first and a manager who can attain standards of excellence at a cost our city can afford
3219494 when i used to play against him you just couldnt throw the ball in the middle of the field because
3219495 coach from men to a real man this is for you
3219496 i expect not to know what to expect and how its going to be like
3219497 i know ill get the jitters a little bit when i go out there because this is my first experience
3219498 las ballenas jorobadas y las ballenas francas australes eubalaena australis est n volviendo a buena parte de su rea de repartici n principalmente porque

3219500 una gran cantidad de peque os cet ceos costeros como el delf n de irrawaddy orcaella brevirostris la marsopa negra phocoena spinipinnis y el delf n de plata pontoporia blainvillei son v ctimas de capturas accidentales durante la pesca considerada la peor amenaza para estas especies
3219501 las zonas de h bitats de importancia cr tica deben ser cerradas a determinados tipos de pesca por lo menos de forma estacional para garantizar la supervivencia de algunas especies

3219504 below the sanctuary in the fellowship hall a banner for slavery reparations proclaimed they owe us fliers recounted herbert daughtrys arrest a few weeks earlier as he led marchers protesting the not guilty verdict in the police killing of sean bell an unarmed black man his ministry has always combined consuming spirituality with black liberation theology the theology jeremiah wright invoked this spring to defend his controversial sermons and zealous political activism leah holds these forces within her
3219505 while the media hounded wright for his anti american rants and while presidential hopeful sen barack hussein obama divorced him as his personal pastor obamas head will be crowned by leah daughtry who ardently believes in the same marcist black liberation theology preached by wright
3219506 we are thrilled to have leah daughtry leading our 2008 democratic convention team
3219507 i am honored to be a part of this exciting endeavor
3219508 like wright daughtry is in your face about her activism thats why i work in politics my family were activists she described herself to thehill com in may 2007
3219509 have you been to our conventions music and waving and happiness its perfect
3219510 some would say with marxist momma in the top job its little wonder why barack obama is the dncs golden boy coming to denver with mainstream media garnered rock star status
3219511 is leading the democratic partys new mission to make religious believers particular ardent christian believers view the party and its candidates as receptive to and often impelled by the dictates of faith
3219512 daughtrys mission directed from within democratic headquarters in washington and the convention offices in denver is essential to transforming the partys reputation so e terri lavelle an evangelical who said within a few minutes of our sitting down to talk on the last saturday in february 1973 i accepted the lord jesus christ as my savior has traveled to evangelical events around the country seeking to strike up relationships with leaders like the megachurch pastors rick warren and joel hunter and hoping that at the very least the partys new attention and respect its desire to listen and engaged with evangelical issues including abortion is recognized
3219513 god allows us to choose in the biggest matter whether to accept him in our lives how then can we take away choice on other profound issues
3219514 she didnt put any distance between herself and the book a black theology of liberation
3219515 at the basis of black liberation theology is the understanding that god has a special place in his heart for those at the bottom of the ladder
3219516 were going to have to win a lot of games
3219517 theres some atmosphere out there we woke up and there were clear skies it feels really good its really pleasant out there
3219518 its great to come here at 9 in the morning and everybodys fired up
3219519 i think everybody had their morning coffee the fans were wonderful
3219520 we played better volleyball today and the conditions were nicer
3219521 we dont care though it could be sweltering it could be freezing we want to play good volleyball and it felt way better today we cut down on our unforced errors and i felt like they had to fight tooth and nail for every single point
3219522 were used to playing three matches a day and getting it over before one oclock
3219523 hell yeah boys they keep trying to play these mind games well just keep on winning think about this for a week boys
3219524 they just havent shown what they were earlier in the season if i had to put my chips on the table you have got jimmie and carl edwards that seem like the guys to beat i would put kyle next
3219525 he was almost leading all three of nascars national series so if its a question of pressure thats been answered
3219526 it feels good to go in on top but its a lot of work to stay there
3219527 we have to wrap up the question of qualification to the group stage at home
3219528 artmedia are a team that score a lot but we are solid at the back and im not worried
3219529 i just wanted to be out on my own which i had done by the 100 metres mark that was my goal
3219530 i was out in open water and i was in the middle which makes it difficult for the other guys to see me
3219531 line up here and well come get you when its time to leave
3219532 russia has invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
3219533 russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty the russian government must reverse the course it appears to be on and accept this peace agreement as a first step toward resolving this conflict
3219534 russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region these actions have substantially damaged russias standing in the world and these actions jeopardize russias relations with the united states and europe
3219535 it now appears that an effort may be under way to depose georgias duly elected government
3219536 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi theres evidence that russian forces may soon begin bombing the civilian airport in the capital city
3219537 these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia
3219538 it is time for russia to be true to its word and to act to end this crisis
3219539 the president thanks you for your untiring fight your strong fight to restore constitutional order
3219540 were there to listen to understand what happened on sunday night and to avoid these kinds of situations
3219541 we have to do better than what weve been doing
3219542 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
3219543 there is no justification for continued russian military action in georgia which threatens the stability of the entire region and risks a humanitarian catastrophe
3219544 the georgians were naive to think that the international system could protect them there will be a lot of blame to go around for this we have failed a young democracy
3219545 the georgians made a big mistake now georgia will have to take the toll most probably disproportionately severe
3219546 i believe the georgians were suckered into this and paid a very heavy price if you embark on a war as the georgians did you have to work out what the consequences will be it was inevitable that the russians would react very heavily
3219547 this makes nato expansion much less likely the last thing the united states needs now is another front thats exactly what russia is taking advantage of
3219548 this war has pushed georgia farther away not just from europe but also complicates the nato council in december
3219549 this result validates the prospect for economic production of pha polymer in switchgrass and demonstrates for the first time an important tool for enhancing switchgrass for value added performance as a bioenergy crop
3219550 the awakening joseph m martin mp3 and i read over where that is written its old non updated content
3219551 do not be slothful in zeal be fervent in spirit serve the lord
3219552 a zealous man feels that like a lamp he is made to burn and if consumed in burning he has but done the work for which god appointed him such a one will always find a sphere for his zeal if he cannot preach and work and give money he will cry and sigh and pray
3219553 if you believe what you like in the gospels and reject what you dont like it is not the gospel you believe but yourself
3219554 wherever we find the word of god surely preached and heard and the sacraments administered according to the institution of christ there it is not to be doubted is a church of god
3219555 and let us with caution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without religion whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined education on minds reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle
3219556 the ultimate determinant in the struggle now going on for the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills and ideas a trial of spiritual resolve the values we hold the beliefs we cherish and the ideals to which we are dedicated
3219557 were going to have to win a lot of games
3219558 that looks exactly the same as every other pitching motion ive ever seen
3219559 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

3219563 good politicians like good scientists draw conclusions from facts bad politicians like bad scientists draw facts from conclusions

3219568 we have not inherited the earth from our parents we have borrowed it from our children
3219569 your publicly stated explanation did not give us confidence the department of health and human services hhs is drafting a rule that would ensure these services
3219570 i am deeply concerned by the pentagons inadequate response to sexual assaults on our troops and the administrations unwillingness to answer questions about these important issues
3219571 service members who brave so many dangers while defending our nation deserve better
3219572 for too many students the skyrocketing cost of attending college has become a barrier to following their dreams
3219573 i am proud that both chambers today have taken the critical step that will ensure more low and middle income students have the opportunity to obtain a college degrees
3219574 it is unconscionable that this administration would even consider putting womens health and prevention in jeopardy
3219575 what would it take for fans to turn on ramirez if punching a teammate and pushing a sixty year old man to the ground didnt
3219576 it comes at a good time with a lot of talk being on alternative transportation
3219577 especially this year with high gas prices the commuter aspect helped
3219578 people kept telling me that women in wisconsin are not ready for something like this
3219579 but it seemed ladies want to get out be active and be sexy its a gym with the additional elements of self esteem building and empowerment
3219580 miss pole is dedicated to providing a safe comfortable confidential and exciting environment for women to incorporate sensuality and fun into an aerobic exercise class while building self confidence therefore criticism to any student self criticism included is not tolerated
3219581 many of the places id taken classes were lights low and candles i dont do that here
3219582 its a bright open environment we have pictures of powerful women icons like marilyn monroe and diana ross on the walls
3219583 30 something married women with kids who want out of the house

3219588 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things
3219589 the set was very crowded that day and im not sure everyone had a reason to be there
3219590 on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron

3219608 abraham was a great man indeed but in the account of his interview with melchizedek it is melchizedek who appears as the greater of the two and if melchizedek was greater than abraham his priesthood must be greater than a priesthood which traces its descent from abraham
3219609 god you first bless me and then i will tithe to you
3219610 a tithe of everything from the land whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees belongs to the lord it is holy to the lord
3219611 the lord said to aaron you will have no inheritance in their land nor will you have any share among them i am your share and your inheritance among the israelites
3219612 do you not know that those who perform sacred services in the temple eat the food of the temple and those who attend regularly to the altar of sacrifice in the temple have their share with the altar
3219613 so also the lord directed those who proclaim the gospel to get their living from the gospel
3219614 let the one who is taught the word share all good things with him who teaches

3219624 when he did leave anything over the middle we did some damage
3219625 to have a big homestand and get beaten by two teams we feel we should play better than is tough to take
3219626 he wasnt able to throw quality strikes on either edge of the plate those balls were hit hard
3219627 i left a lot of pitches over the top of the plate im better than that i know that
3219628 from what we understand there is a gang of hoons aged in their twenties from the kallangur area that are behind this
3219629 these are really vicious cases that are deliberately calculated and cruel
3219630 when you look at the case of the crow someone has actually held this bird down and sawed off its wings its just sick and disturbing
3219631 when you look at animal cruelty its one of the key profiling tools used by police to indicate the potential for further criminal activity

3219638 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3219639 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that
3219640 we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3219641 it gives iphone a justifiable claim to being a viable gaming platform
3219642 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3219643 while america considers georgia its strongest ally in the bloc of former soviet countries washington needs russia too much on big issues like iran to risk it all to defend georgia
3219644 you should have a base of 20 miles a week for six months before starting
3219645 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3219646 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3219647 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3219648 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3219649 so is it better with this one or with this one
3219650 rusia ha invadido a un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr ticamente elegido por sus ciudadanos una acci n as es inaceptable en el siglo xx
3219651 el gobierno ruso tiene que respetar la integridad territorial y la soberan a de georgia el gobierno ruso tiene que revertir el curso en el que parece que est y aceptar este acuerdo de paz como primer paso hacia la resoluci n del conflicto
3219652 acciones de rusia esta semana han generado serias dudas sobre sus intenciones en georgia y la regi n estas acciones han da ado sustancialmente la posici n de rusia en el mundo
3219653 esas acciones ponen en riesgo las relaciones de rusia con eeuu y europa es hora de que rusia cumpla con su palabra y actuar para poner fin a la crisis
3219654 hay evidencia de que las fuerzas rusas podr an comenzar pronto a bombardear el aeropuerto civil en la capital
3219655 si estas informaciones son ciertas estas acciones rusas representar an una dram tica y brutal escalada del conflicto en georgia

3219693 eu citizens of roma or gypsy origin must be treated equally to others in italy
3219694 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3219695 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3219696 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3219697 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3219698 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3219699 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3219700 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3219701 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3219702 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3219703 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3219704 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3219705 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3219706 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3219707 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3219708 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3219709 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3219710 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3219711 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3219712 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3219713 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3219714 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3219715 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3219716 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3219717 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

3219726 the residents here have applied to the authorities to turn the two wooden blocks into a community hall it was a bit of a culture shock when i first came here in 2006 but i have since adapted this is very noble to the situation
3219727 intense stifling why would i give away all my magic secrets
3219728 people are always asking me if these are boxing boots but no i got them from a magic retailer now put up your rocket launchers
3219729 we just blew the back out this kick drum were rocking so damn hard

3219736 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3219737 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3219738 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3219739 break the rules to help people who give them a lot of money
3219740 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3219741 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3219742 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3219743 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3219744 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3219745 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3219746 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3219747 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3219748 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3219749 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3219750 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3219751 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3219752 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3219753 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3219754 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3219755 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3219757 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3219758 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3219759 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3219760 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3219761 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

3219768 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3219769 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3219770 please stay alive long enough for me to die i dont want to see my friend die

3219777 were going to see an extended period of sideways movement in the yuan
3219778 chinas ability to fend off a big slowdown should not be underestimated
3219779 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3219780 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3219781 this would be so much better if i could just do it right with this tool or that gadget

3219784 the united nations estimates that at least 14 million people in the horn of africa are in urgent need of food aid due to conflict dramatic rises in food costs and severe drought two countries most threatened by this crisis are somalia and ethiopia where 2 6 million and 4 6 million people respectively face severe food shortages somalia is already in the grip of the worlds worst humanitarian crisis it has been without an effective government for nearly two decades but since 2007 the situation has declined sharply conflict failed rains and hyperinflation have made staple foods such as rice and corn unaffordable for many
3219785 this is a story about a man named eddie and it begins at the end with eddie dying in the sun it might seem strange to start a story with an ending all endings are also beginnings we just dont know it at the time
3219786 the delay gives us time to focus on restoring momentum in our core business and for consumers in general to regain their footing and their confidence
3219787 we hope to resume construction in three to four quarters assuming credit market conditions and the overall outlook for the economy improve

3219789 the 6 6 percent decline is about on pace with casinos year to date decline the decline might have been less were it not for the decline in table games which contributed more than usual for the month

3219797 it is not our strategic intent for you to understand
3219798 are using overblown imprecise confusing gobbledygook to try to sound big and important
3219799 its a definite business advantage and strategic advantage to communicate with clarity and coherence
3219800 all the audiences of these big companies are crying for clarity
3219801 a lot of corporations really dont know who they are
3219802 being able to describe a complex concept clearly and succinctly is really an indication of how well you know that subject
3219803 a lot of these guys they want to throw in the kitchen sink obfuscate with jargon
3219804 to get them off of that it takes a major war
3219805 we do not see these conditions abating in the near term
3219806 i do agree an innocent life should not ever carry the burden of its impure beginnings and a man must be careful of how harshly one judges himself
3219807 we still have our daily communication from the ships that seek our young queen and as far as making an enemy it has always been the rialtan policy to view unknown cultures as enemies until proven otherwise
3219808 daekartha our love could never be but i gave you all that i could when you so desperately needed it the security of one who would never betray you and the words of the things to come that you could not see we are to be no longer you have a destiny a child to bear and you will have a son that will be all to you please go love sophy and raise that child together within the confines of a solid love full of commitment please milord chandalar does not bear the responsibility of producing an heir to the throne as you do he chooses to live a life without the love of a child to share my life it is a sacrifice that you cannot afford to make
3219809 but i can take you and have you at my convenience either way you will never have a child but my way you will have me and i will have you
3219810 please daekartha it will influence the life of the child that sophy bears there can be no joy for her if she never owns your heart and milord until you let me go and move on she will never own your heart
3219811 perhaps she will never own my heart amrita i chose her for the influence that she brings to my fledgling empire for the strong families that she unites among many different voices and the voices all cry out for different things
3219812 in time my high king in time she will come to own your heart and you shall own hers
3219813 milord you do own sophys heart and she owns yours you did come to know joy in time did you not
3219814 yes i have known great joy in my sophys arms and in her heart amrita my oldest ally and confidante why do your eyes tell of immeasurable sadness
3219815 my good mate i have been a fool for so many years what of my old friend chandalar i miss him i long to ask for his forgiveness and his understanding how dare i have stood in the way of their happiness
3219816 olpc had asked intel to end our support for non olpc platforms including the classmate pc and to focus on the olpc platform exclusively at the end of the day we decided we couldnt accommodate that request
3219817 my expectation was that theres lots of room for cooperation particularly on software but i couldnt get intel interested in helping me with any of those problems the only thing they intel marketing people were interested in was helping them make marketing statements about how intels approach to learning was different from olpcs approach to learning they werent interested in how we can learn together and make something better for kids
3219818 why me why was my life like this why was i never to have two parents who loved me and saw to my needs why was there never a mother for me who did not fester a horrible sickness in her mind
3219819 why was i even born if not to bring pain into the lives of so many what did any of them ever do to deserve the sadness i have wrought
3219820 giver above i am sorry for the things that i have done i would give my life to take back all of the pain it could not have been because it was meant to have been is there absolution and will it ever be mine
3219821 the soul is a lens to see life through that night as he lay down to sleep beside an open fire out under the heavens above he kissed the closed hand that rose up from his heart and then he reached out his fingers stretching them skyward
3219822 give me the answer and give me a chance to make my heart believe again
3219823 abraxum i cannot imagine where he has gone off to without so much as a hint left behind perhaps he is already on cyndonne and since rialt has heard no news from that world if he is already there it has not gone well and maybe he is already dead
3219824 my young king he has little means to move about except to move as a poor beggar he would be viewed as a refugee thus he would be treated as a refugee and the best place for him to find concealment and remain concealed is to live and to move amongst refugees
3219825 eden it is eden you think that gives him a warm dry bed and a full belly
3219826 it would be a good place to search at least to stop in and ask a few questions milord

3219828 little risstian you have to slow down you are impetuous just like your mommee giver above i pray that you have better editing skills than she does
3219829 soon my little man she will hold you and i will hold her and your brother gavin and our lives will be complete
3219830 cuy milord what is the word from beyond the rim has dhurstan been heard from or burmandar any of them
3219831 no word yet but i believe that they are all fine amrita told me so and i have no reason to doubt what she says and to tell you another thing i do believe that it will be soon that we find earth and with it we find my riss and i will
3219832 never let her go i will hold her for all time and we will share all days we will know the joy of raising our children together and ruling the rialtan empire hand in hand
3219833 milord it will be the best day of all days when she is returned to us you know even if she does not know us initially she has a basic goodness within that will have her be kind to us and wanting to recall the life that she shared with us she is a good friend to me perhaps the best friend that i ever had
3219834 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
3219835 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3219836 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
3219837 its very clear that eliminating this protein has cardiovascular benefits
3219838 rna based drugs might provide a course of treatment for people whose cholesterol levels are resistant to current drugs or they might be combined with current drugs
3219839 we found that the vast majority of parents were taking their children to a retail clinic as a substitute for regular care either at a doctors office emergency department or urgent care clinic
3219840 about half of the parents said they wanted to take care of their childrens problems more quickly which suggests to us that doctors offices may not be meeting expectations of parents in terms of providing timely care
3219841 the american academy of pediatrics is concerned that retail clinics interrupt the care that kids otherwise would receive from their regular doctors when those interruptions occur in care information about childrens health problems which their doctors need to know about can slip through the cracks and that can lead to worse health care for kids in the long run
3219842 our results make it much more clear that all men and women concerned about their overall health should more closely monitor their blood levels of vitamin d and make sure they have enough
3219843 we think we have additional evidence to consider adding vitamin d deficiency as a distinct and separate risk factor for death from cardiovascular disease putting it alongside much better known and understood risk factors such as age gender family history smoking high blood cholesterol levels high blood pressure lack of exercise obesity and diabetes
3219844 now that we know vitamin d deficiency is a risk factor we can better assess how aggressively to treat people at risk of heart disease or those who are already ill and undergoing treatment
3219845 one of the big problems weve had is its moving faster than we thought
3219846 its not a very nice survey thats essentially the short answer

3219849 bill is a non conformist hes a maverick hes a very provocative teacher
3219850 what seems to be the provacateur for all of this
3219851 is the idea that debaters are allowed to strike two judges and in this case there were 5 judges and the fort hays state university team struck two judges who had given them low scores in the past one of them happened to be a black female and that set the thing off
3219852 and were sure that theres probably some facts and information thats just not available
3219853 i mean you see a lot on the video but we need to make sure everything is revealed before we take any action
3219854 i wish everyone would recognize the importance of these issues and stop to think about the consequences theyre having on real people
3219855 the court confirmed the commissions view that reducing monopoly profits through lower prices is an obvious and significant benefit to gas consumers
3219856 gas consumers have been receiving such benefits since october 2005 when the commission required powerco and vector to lower their average gas pipeline prices by 9 percent and 9 5 percent respectively
3219857 i think i should know what im doing by now
3219858 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
3219859 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
3219860 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
3219861 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
3219862 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
3219863 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
3219864 brain waves comprised of neuron impulses seem to flow along the neurons and down the spinal cord in a spiral pattern
3219865 we see spiral forms omnipresent throughout the visible and invisible universe in galaxies accretion disks around black holes coalescing interstellar clouds excitable media and many other forms of matter and energy
3219866 we found that only a few distinct archetypal forms and patterns of behavior characterize the interaction of matter energy and field forces at ten distinct quantum defined scales of natural evolution

3219886 most reporters are trying to help barack obama win the election this year
3219887 since the second world war and the beginning of the atomic age the consciousness of the creative writer however detached has been confronted with the specter of the totalitarian state the growing poverty and helplessness of western europe and the threat of an inconceivably destructive war which may annihilate civilization and mankind itself clearly when the future of civilization is no longer assured a criticism if american life in terms of a contrast between avowed ideals and present actuality cannot be a primary preoccupation and source of inspiration for america not europe is now the sanctuary of culture civilizations very existence depends upon america upon the actuality of american life and not the ideals of the american dream to criticize the actuality upon which all hope depends thus becomes a criticism of hope itself
3219888 ive got nothing to do and im doing it tomorrow
3219889 obviously if you are reading this then i have died in iraq i kind of predicted this that is why im writing this in november a third time just seemed like im pushing my chances i dont regret going everybody dies but few get to do it for something as important as freedom it may seem confusing why we are in iraq its not to me im here helping these people so that they can live the way we live not have to worry about tyrants or vicious dictators to do what they want with their lives to me that is why i died others have died for my freedom now this is my mark
3219890 nobody is interested in solutions if they dont think theres a problem given that starting point i believe it is appropriate to have an over representation of factual presentations on how dangerous it is as a predicate for opening up the audience to listen to what the solutions are and how hopeful it is that we are going to solve this crisis
3219891 there is unmistakable evidence that saddam hussein is working aggressively to develop nuclear weapons and will likely have nuclear weapons within the next five years
3219892 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
3219893 there is no doubt that saddam hussein has invigorated his weapons programs in addition saddam continues to redefine delivery systems and is doubtless using the cover of a licit missile program to develop longer range missiles that will threaten the united states and our allies
3219894 how close is the peril of iraqi wmd today or at most within a few months iraq could launch missile attacks with chemical or biological weapons against its neighbors albeit attacks that would be ragged inaccurate and limited in size within four or five years it could have the capability to threaten most of the middle east and parts of europe with missiles armed with nuclear weapons containing fissile material produced indigenously and to threaten u s territory with such weapons delivered by nonconventional means such as commercial shipping containers if it managed to get its hands on sufficient quantities of already produced fissile material these threats could arrive much sooner
3219895 iraq is automatically an imminent threat to the countries that surround it because of the possession of these weapons
3219896 i agree with president bush he has said that saddam hussein is evil and he is hussein is a vicious dictator and a documented deceiver he has invaded his neighbors used chemical arms and failed to account for all the chemical and biological weapons he had before the gulf war he has murdered dissidents and refused to comply with his obligations under un security council resolutions and he has tried to build a nuclear bomb anyone who believes in the importance of limiting the spread of weapons of mass killing the value of democracy and the centrality of human rights must agree that saddam hussein is a menace the world would be a better place if he were in a different place other than the seat of power in baghdad or any other country
3219897 theres no question that saddam hussein is a threat yes he has chemical and biological weapons he is as far as we know actively pursuing nuclear capabilities though he doesnt have nuclear warheads yet if he were to acquire nuclear weapons i think our friends in the region would face greatly increased risks as would we
3219898 i t is incontestable that on the day i left office there were unaccounted for stocks of biological and chemical weapons we might have destroyed them in 98 we tried to but we sure as heck didnt know it because we never got to go back there
3219899 other countries possess weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missiles
3219900 when former president bill clinton was here recently he told me was absolutely convinced given his years in the white house and the access to privileged information which he had that iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction until the end of the saddam regime
3219901 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has 10 times since 1983
3219902 iraq is a long way from here but what happens there matters a great deal here for the risks that the leaders of a rogue state will use nuclear chemical or biological weapons against us or our allies is the greatest security threat we face
