7100112 the attempt made by the dmk to demean the cpi m leaders is nothing but political indecency tamil nadu was able to get an unprecedented number of berths in the union cabinet since the left decided to stay away from joining the government
7100113 on the other hand it is the congress and the bjp that always joined together to pull down non congress governments at the centre
7100114 the whole attempt is to see that the text of the waiver is so drafted that will allow the indian government to claim that it has virtually got a clean waiver

7100124 i felt we played well but we didnt score this game is all about scoring goals
7100125 it is almost impossible to pump diesel fuel into a petrol car because the larger diameter of the pump nozzle prevents it being inserted into the smaller filler neck of a vehicle designed for petrol
7100126 caparo rightfuel which replaces the vehicles filler cap uses the difference in nozzle diameters to protect diesel vehicles if the correct diesel nozzle has been presented rightfuels patented mechanism disengages its prevention flap allowing fuel to be pumped into the tank
7100127 specialists at the caparo innovation centre at the university of wolverhampton helped refine and validate the design it was presented to caparos ceo angad paul who immediately saw the potential and agreed to back it through to production

7100140 section 498 a was added to the indian penal code in the backdrop of the growing menace of dowry related cases in which the women were subjected to cruelty and harassment and were forced to commit suicide this section lays down that if the husband or his relative subjects a woman to cruelty then he she is liable to be punished with imprisonment for three years and a fine
7100141 section 498 a has a wider spectrum and it covers all cases in which the wife is subjected to cruelty by her husband or his relative which may result in suicide or grave injury or danger to life limb or health whether mental of physical or even harassment caused with a view to coercing the woman or any person related to her to meet the unlawful demand for dowry of property or valuable security
7100142 an accused can be convicted of dowry offence with which he may not have been specifically charged and that an error omission or irregularity in the framing of charge by itself is not sufficient for upsetting the conviction
7100143 a reading of sections 221 1 and 2 of the cr pc shows that if a single act or series of acts constitutes several offences and the prosecution is not certain about the particular offence then the accused can be charged with having committed all some or any of the offences in such a case the accused can be convicted of the offence with which he may not have been specifically charged but in which evidence produced by the prosecution proves that such an offence has in fact been committed

7100154 we have a lot of confidence that we can secure a fifth title this year and we know a big weekend in indy would go a long ways towards that goal
7100155 first we want to make sure we have the best starting position in the countdown to 1 secondly you want to be peaking at the right time indy is very important to us in both regards
7100156 everyone associated with the sport of drag racing knows the history of this event and what it means to win indy
7100157 its the history of the race the legends that have won there in the past the huge attendance by the fans all the industry players that come to town its just a huge deal all the way around
7100158 weve very pleased with the performance of the jegs com chevrolet cobalt at the moment and were excited by the prospect of improving even more our team owner victor cagnazzi has his staff very focused on the upcoming countdown to 1 and having the strength of three team cars in the countdown field will help us all compete at the level its going to take to win it all
7100159 the 10 teams in the countdown have worked hard to get there and now the points are reshuffled and we all have a great chance to show our stuff
7100160 it will be a lot easier for the fans and the members of the media that cover our sport to keep up with the system plus i firmly believe the best man will win it all were ready to get started
7100161 we had been on the look out for this vehicle since yesterday evening based on the report of a drunken driver at the wheel
7100162 we didnt find it until the crash was reported this morning

7100168 where youre in a denial you go back to help you front the post then you deny on the other side then youre back to help then a guy comes down the lane and you step in and take a charge and close out the intensity of it was unbelievable
7100169 and our guys saw it they just looked at it and said were going to get
7100170 all this coaxing this being coy and planning to the nth degree is going to invite the most detailed critical scrutiny that youve ever seen
7100171 in spite of the fact that the rumored choices are all wonderful people none of them is jesus and none of them is moses even their friends can point out shortcomings
7100172 this is about the realisation were all gonna be eaten by the worms so youve got to live as much as you can cause itll all be gone soon
7100173 i need to pee maybe i will feel a little less desperate once ive relieved this pressure
7100174 yeah i have a pretty bright kid and im proud of him
7100175 i just wanted to apologize for dumping all my stuff on you
7100176 were going ring shopping i think i may have thrown up but im not sure it was a blur
7100177 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world
7100178 i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run
7100179 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time
7100180 felipes going to be hard to beat but well certainly push for it
7100181 i am understandably disappointed with the qualifying session because i had other hopes
7100182 the race will therefore be more difficult but as were on a street course anything is possible in the race
7100183 this was a very good qualifying for the team and me
7100184 after some unlucky races lately the pace of the car here in valencia is not that bad however there is a small gap to ferrari and mclaren

7100187 every speech should contain the line you were born in the middle of america
7100188 the deeply american values you grew up with learned as a child and that drive you today
7100189 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
7100190 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
7100191 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men

7100194 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
7100195 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
7100196 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
7100197 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
7100198 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
7100199 you work for years to built that invincibility knowing that at some point its going to break the mirror is going to break
7100200 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared to the greatest
7100201 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
7100202 its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
7100203 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
7100204 i look forward to the u s open i still have really this and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now try to save my season
7100205 the last years i did very well too i was very happy being the no 2 so finally im no 1
7100206 i dont have time to celebrate so probably after new york after davis cup im going to have a good time
7100207 i feel like im playing really solid and much better than i have been all year to be honest i really look forward to it
7100208 of 532 children who lost both parents in the earthquake 240 were under the age of 14 most of them had their grandparents or other relatives as guardians only 88 orphans currently need care
7100209 its going a little farther than i think the horses optimum distance is but hes really in top form right now i couldnt be any happier with him and i really wouldnt want to trade with anybody right now
7100210 i would welcome participating in a paternity test be happy to participate in one happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
7100211 by what power or by what name do you do this
7100212 there is no other name under heaven given among mortals by which we must be saved
7100213 he who did not spare his own son but gave him up for us all how will he not also along with him graciously give us all things
7100214 where your treasure is there your heart will be also
7100215 remember this whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly and whoever sows generously will also reap generously each man should give what he has decided in his heart to give not reluctantly or under compulsion for god loves a cheerful giver
7100216 we have gifts that differ according to the grace given to us prophecy in proportion to faith ministry in ministering the teacher in teaching the exhorter in exhortation the giver in generosity the leader in diligence the compassionate in cheerfulness
7100217 like good stewards of the manifold grace of god serve one another with whatever gift each of you has received
7100218 if a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food and one of you says to them go in peace keep warm and eat your fill and yet you do not supply their bodily needs what is the good of that
7100219 could it be as some have suggested that mothers who use cell phones frequently are simply not very attentive parents sure but those children who were only exposed in utero had significant increases in behavior problems too which suggests there may be something deeper going on
7100220 electromagnetic radiation from cell phones poses a unique hazard to a developing fetus
7100221 t hese radio waves are literally everywhere transmitting signals to wireless computers cordless phones cell phone base stations and countless other wireless technologies
7100222 the word of god is found in the bible alone
7100223 and all drank the same spiritual drink for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and the rock was christ
7100224 as jannes and jambres opposed moses so these people of corrupt mind and counterfeit faith also oppose the truth
7100225 in all this i have given you an example that by such work we must support the weak remembering the words of the lord jesus for he himself said
7100226 but there are also many other things that jesus did if every one of them were written down i suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written
7100227 all scripture is inspired by god and is useful for teaching for reproof for correction and for training in righteousness so that everyone who belongs to god may be proficient equipped for every good work
7100228 they devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and fellowship to the breaking of bread and the prayers
7100229 so then brothers and sisters stand firm and hold fast to the traditions that you were taught by us either by word of mouth or by our letter
7100230 i urge you brothers and sisters to keep an eye on those who cause dissensions and offences in opposition to the teaching that you have learned avoid them
7100231 how can i understand scripture unless someone explains it to me
7100232 he answered them and why do you break the commandment of god for the sake of your tradition
7100233 so for the sake of your tradition you make void the word of god
7100234 whoever speaks evil of father or mother must surely die
7100235 the scribes and the pharisees sit on moses seat therefore do whatever they teach you and follow it but do not do as they do for they do not practice what they teach
7100236 i commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions just as i handed them on to you
7100237 if i am delayed you may know how one ought to behave in the household of god which is the church of the living god the pillar and bulwark of the truth

7100246 credit to tottenham they deservedly got their equaliser but we showed good character after they scored with cisse coming on i thought that if we got one or two half chances wed take them

7100256 karlsruhe made it very difficult for us and therefore we didnt have many goal scoring chances
7100257 our approach play was simply too slow and we lacked creativity in midfield we should therefore be happy with the fact that we managed to pick up three points
7100258 well have to wrangle with this defeat for a long time we didnt allow them many chances and created one or two for ourselves

7100263 weve probably done as much for our own downfall as newcastle have done to gain three points i thought we were as every bit as good if not better than newcastle united today
7100264 weve had the penalty which kevin has missed that happens that gave them a huge boost not just the players but the fans as well once that settled down i still thought we were the better team they had more possession than we had but in areas that didnt hurt us

7100268 were all about building people up we re all about helping people reach their full potential we dont push some kind of religion all we push is joy and peace and victory through jesus christ our message every single week is through faith in god you can live an overcoming life of victory i believe thats the message this generation needs to hear weve heard a lot about the judgment of god and what we cant do and whats going to keep us out of heaven but its time people start hearing about the goodness of god about a god that loves them a god that believes in them a god that wants to help them thats our message here at lakewood
7100269 forget the fire and brimstone popular preacher joel osteen offers his listeners a simple upbeat message

7100279 so start believing according to gods word then begin making

7100281 kenyons view all sickness is essentially from satan and we can with the power of faith command satan and demand our healing
7100282 i command the author of sickness to leave my body

7100295 when a guy lets a week pass before he contacts you its his way of forcing casualness in the relationship
7100296 its an unspoken signal that he doesnt want to pursue you seriously either because the timing is off or he just didnt click with you

7100311 theyre offering you a chance to carry on helping people prue
7100312 a situation is developing even as we speak one that could give us huge problems latter on
7100313 theres a chaos mage in a small town called sunnydale hes going to turn everyone into their costumes for halloween
7100314 that mage will turn someone into his costume and in the process bring about possibly the end of days
7100315 not quite were talking about the end of space and time as we know it that mage doesnt even realize what hes doing
7100316 there are two other things you need to know about that town hopefully this will help me get this cleared up one its on a hellmouth a mystical convergence a weak barrier between this dimension and the one known as hell
7100317 thats the least of it theres a slayer down there protecting the hellmouth its not due to be opened for several years yet at which time well they arent sure what will happen but because of the hellmouth and the chaos mages spell an independent entity is about to be created
7100318 right now hes just turned 18 though he thinks hes 17
7100319 hes adopted though he doesnt know it yet as sometimes happens another birth certificate was issued with the wrong date in fact the fact hes adopted is what makes this so complicated
7100320 because he is descended from one of the oldest romany houses one that hales all the way back to transylvania
7100321 hes a born witch though there is a seal on his lines magical abilities
7100322 you will i dont know what they were but you saved my life in my book thats worthy of reward

7100329 and this is the guy you want me to watch out for
7100330 no this is the guy we want you to guide and work with
7100331 it is but this is an unusual situation after tonight hell see straight through you so there is little point in trying to hide
7100332 no as i said he could go either way if he stays on the side of the angels he could be a great help to the cause
7100333 the entity he becomes is masked from us the future from 8pm tonight is totally blind where he is concerned
7100334 ill answer that later right now we have a lot to get through and very little time to do it

7100356 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7100357 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7100358 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions

7100368 when a guest from tomsk siberia shows a slide show of a kulimela event in siberia at a kulimela event in belgium to an audience of organizers from kulimelas in america everyone sees the power of srila prabhupada
7100369 for me the film festival with madis cymbals and ishans kiss of the lark was also a major highlight
7100370 the goal of kuli mela is first to share then to serve then to be inspired and then to act
7100371 the formula allows for each person to experience the spiritual and material connections on their own terms and in their own ways but always with a gentle push towards the highest level of happiness the congregational chanting of the holy name
7100372 we gave out t shirts to all volunteers who did service for more than three hours and we ran out
7100373 we started with 300 t shirts which means that over 75 of the delegates served it created an amazing atmosphere
7100374 new crews keep coming forward to do events an australian event is lined up for 2010 teams in italy france and amazingly kazakhstan have stepped forward to organize their own melas a european bus tour may be on the cards and the mega mela in la in 2009 should really take the whole project to an even higher level
7100375 they exhibited all vaishnava qualities and gave us a great example of how to be in management

7100388 el gobierno merece un comentario positivo por su apoyo al aumento de los recursos destinados a proyectos de colaboraci n mundial para el incremento del acceso a los tratamientos pero la tragedia es que ese mismo legado positivo ha estado ligado al conservadurismo moral de un modo contraproducente y muy poco cient fico en lo que se refiere a las pol ticas de prevenci n
7100389 por el nfasis en la abstinencia en la reducci n de parejas sexuales y en el impulso a la monogamia enfoques todos que a lo largo de 25 a os han demostrado total ineficacia y que han sido adoptados en el contexto de la prevenci n de la epidemia como una forma de legitimaci n moralista
7100390 muchos gobiernos latinoamericanos incluso los m s conservadores han mostrado que el sermoneo moral no es la mejor respuesta a los retos que presenta la epidemia y han promovido sin mayor restricci n la entrega masiva de preservativos y el acceso universal a los tratamientos este legado es importante y particularmente s lido ya que no proviene de una d diva oficial sino de larga tradici n de activismo social y pol tico en defensa de los derechos civiles de las personas afectadas por la epidemia y de los programas que satisfacen sus necesidades

7100392 because it engulfs so many people so much of the time hours and hours of time are wasted while we sit idly in front of the tv as our minds stew aimlessly and our bodies increasingly get weak and fat i agree
7100393 we have had a very good fall camp up to this point
7100394 he was more productive and gave us more of a physical presence
7100395 we are using trey in two different capacities it is nice to have someone who has played as much football as he has and it is nice to have someone who can play versatile positions
7100396 we do so many different things with our formation and personnel groups i think danny is a little more ahead of myles i think both of them will play a lot of football for us danny is a guy who has excellent hands and isnt afraid of making a mistake
7100397 they will both fit in that position i think briggs more ready than gibson where and how much is still to be determined obviously you want depth at that position so you want guys playing early as much as they can
7100398 clancy can do so many different things he can catch the ball well in the back field if we use him as a halfback he is a guy obviously who runs the ball well he had a very good fall camp and he is a senior and it is important to him
7100399 it will go as far as our team will take it which includes our managers our trainers our doctors and our sports information director

7100429 the killers decided to shoot another video this one for the song
7100430 we were just kicking around ideas for the bones video and we thought wouldnt it be great if tim burton could shoot this we reached out to his people and he came back and said he wanted to work with us which was amazing
7100431 weve shot all our parts and now the video is being worked on its going to have computer graphics and models were not really sure how its going to turn out usually we go over the treatment with a fine toothed comb and have a lot of influence but this time we just let tim do his thing
7100432 a lot of the models and sets are based on historic las vegas on things that arent there anymore like the glass pool inn this really cool place that was torn down a few years ago that was down at the south end of the strip
7100433 but like mark said we dont really know 100 percent what its going to be like we put our faith in tim

7100436 mom and dad both like beer my mom gets funny when she drinks it and takes her top off at parties but dad doesnt think this is very funny
7100437 my mom and dad talk funny when they drink beer and the more they drink the more they give kisses to each other which is a good thing
7100438 my dad gets funny on beer he is funny he also wets his pants sometimes so he shouldnt have too much
7100439 my dad loves beer the more he drinks the better he dances one time he danced right into the pool
7100440 i dont like beer very much every time dad drinks it he burns the sausages on the barbecue and they taste disgusting
7100441 i give dads beer to the dog and he goes to sleep silly things and picks on my father whenever she drinks beer she yells at dad and tells him to go bury his bone down the street again but that doesnt make any sense

7100478 hoi hoe gaat het alleen vanavond blijf je thuis ja dan kom ik nog even langs dan ben je niet zo alleen
7100479 uw vader in de hemel weet al wat je nodig hebt
7100480 tu nas ni de titres ni de grades mais tu dis tu quand tu parles dieu
7100481 bent u ook aan het inhuizen ik bedoel aan het inhuizen voor uw zoon
7100482 er is geen sprake van dat die kruisbeelden zouden moeten verdwijnen
7100483 ik woon en werk tussen jonge mensen die mij zeggen dat ze de ruimte niet zouden binnenkomen wanneer daar een kruisbeeld zou hangen een kruisbeeld schrikt hen af de jongeren van vandaag zijn veel minder christelijk religieus ook al komen ze uit katholieke scholen omdat wij de ruimte voor verstilling openstellen voor alle studenten en personeelsleden en dus ook voor mensen van andere gezindten hebben wij gezocht naar een oplossing
7100484 het is een duidelijke verwijzing naar het christelijk verhaal en het toont aan dat wij proberen dat verhaal op ons leven te leggen
7100485 veel van het gedachtengoed dat wij nu progressief noemen is daar ontstaan je weet vroeger was vlaanderen zwaar katholiek een beetje achterlijk zelfs dat we op ethisch vlak momenteel aan de absolute wereldtop staan daar heeft humo een erg grote rol in gespeeld
7100486 ja maar je moet toch ook eens aan jezelf denken
7100487 het was vroeger toch beter toen werkten we samen nu werken we vooral met de ellebogen want anders duwen anderen ons weg
7100488 the laity in the history of the church in new york
7100489 we showed a little bit of growth in the hard market from 2004 2006 but now you see our premiums coming down and from 2006 where we wrote 1 3 billion weve now declined to 1 1 billion which is about a 15 decline thats the front edge of our soft market strategy
7100490 we are not going to write under priced business and we are not very focused on the top line we are really focused on your bottom line and if we need to get smaller to maintain our returns we are going to do that and well return the capital we are not using to wtm and it will be put to good use elsewhere most of the shrink in premiums is coming from the north american market where prices are declining more rapidly than europe and elsewhere the european market tends to be more stable
7100491 we had a fairly calm first half of the year so far and if we include a full catastrophe load in second half results which is the long term average catastrophe experience we can report a combined ratio of less than 100 for the year
7100492 the casualty business is the one that is actually shrinking probably most rapidly that was a 350 million business in the hard market and it is heading down to just north of a 100 million business next year
7100493 sirius has in its u s gaap books a 400 million deferred tax liability we dont ever expect to pay that deferred tax liability not a penny of it the swedish regulators dont require recordation of that liability in fact they count that money as capital and the ratings agencies count that money as capital but its not in our gaap net worth but when we look at sirius business however we think of that as quasi equity thats really a cheap source of leverage in that business
7100494 in accordance with provisions of swedish law sirius international is permitted to transfer up to the full amount of its pre tax income subject to certain limitations into an untaxed reserve referred to as a safety reserve which equaled 1 4 billion at december 31 2007 under gaap an amount equal to the safety reserve net of the related deferred tax liability established at the swedish tax rate of 28 is classified as shareholders equity generally this deferred tax liability is only required to be paid by sirius international if it fails to maintain predetermined levels of premium writings and loss reserves in future years as a result of the indefinite deferral of these taxes swedish regulatory authorities do not apply any taxes to the safety reserve when calculating solvency capital under swedish insurance regulations accordingly under local statutory requirements an amount equal to the deferred tax liability on sirius internationals safety reserve 398 million at december 31 2007 is included in solvency capital access to the safety reserve is restricted to coverage of aggregate losses and requires the approval of swedish regulatory authorities
7100495 weve got players coming in from all over the place into our business whether they are hedge funds or private equity using all different types of securities cat bonds sidecars we have used a couple of sidecars in the past ourselves many of these sources of capital have a lower cost of capital for the risk they are taking on than we do on our own balance sheet
7100496 thats a tough equation to win and rather than trying to compete with that in our present format we will have to become more and more competitive in those markets and use those tools
7100497 isolate politically one of the parties to the conflict through an attempt to throw the weight of the council behind the other party
7100498 fox news has learned that some american terrorist investigators fear certain suspects in the sept 11 attacks may have managed to stay ahead of them by knowing who and when investigators are calling on the telephone
7100499 it is virtually impossible to make a call on normal phones without generating an amdocs record of it
7100500 the super secret national security agency headquartered in northern maryland issued whats called a top secret sensitive compartmentalized information report ts sci warning that records of calls in the united states were getting into foreign hands in israel in particular
7100501 probing an explosive foreign espionage operation that could dwarf the other spy scandals plaguing the u s government insight has learned that fbi counterintelligence is tracking a daring operation to spy on high level us officials by hacking into supposedly secure telephone networks the espionage was facilitated federal officials say by lax telephone security procedures at the white house state department and other high level government offices and by a justice department unwillingness to seek an indictment against a suspect
7100502 were not even sure we know the extent of it
7100503 all i can tell you is that we think we know how it was done that alone is serious enough but its the unknown that has such deep consequences
7100504 came up in the select intelligence committee on capitol hill today
7100505 they intend to look into what we reported last night
7100506 it has been a whistle stop tour of medieval treasures
7100507 why would the celebrities pay to move someone whom we all know had been documented by the federal government of the united states of america repeatedly committing crimes against the sun more than 500 miles into the suns neighborhood to resume stalking the sun which we all know damn good and well they did
7100508 why hasnt the united states federal government whom we all know damn good and well has repeatedly documented the womans criminal history against the sun stopped or apprehended the woman yet

7100512 my god did you get a look at her joel osteens wife she look like a real mean bitch
7100513 i dont know if it would have been worth the 400 thousand dollars she was suing for but i believe the airline steward was telling the truth and the osteen wife was lying through her teeth regarding the wife i think shes guilty
7100514 but then it made a turn as if the wing dropped abruptly

7100539 at 1 week after transplantation the fish oil diet had induced 7 fold more metastases in terms of number and size than had the low fat diet whereas the safflower oil diet had not affected the number and total volume of metastases
7100540 at 3 weeks after tumor transplantation the fish oil diet and the safflower oil diet had induced respectively 10 and 4 fold more metastases number and over 1000 and 500 fold more metastases size than were found in the livers of rats on the low fat diet
7100541 the effects of omega 3 pufas on the proliferation of colon cancer cells and on the growth of metastases in the liver are stronger than the effects of omega 6 pufas
7100542 revealed that the immune system in the liver kupffer cells pit cells t cells newly recruited macrophages and the activation state of macrophages did not play a significant role in this diet dependent outgrowth of tumors
7100543 the enormous effect of omega 3 pufa on colon cancer metastasis in the liver is not mediated via alterations of the immune system

7100579 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7100580 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7100581 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7100582 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7100583 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7100584 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7100585 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7100586 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7100587 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7100595 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7100596 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7100597 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7100598 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7100599 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7100600 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7100601 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7100602 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio

7100604 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura

7100607 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7100608 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7100609 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7100610 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7100611 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables

7100615 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7100616 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7100617 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7100618 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7100619 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7100620 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso

7100624 todo el trabajo del gobierno en este momento est volcado en acabar cuanto antes
7100625 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7100626 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7100627 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7100628 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7100629 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible

7100632 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7100633 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7100634 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7100635 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7100636 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7100639 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7100642 they want to identify their loved ones soon so they can go home people are anxious to begin the grieving process
7100643 we would have gotten the same information had it been a janitor speaking to us
7100644 we understand the frustration and we share it because we lost nine crew members in this flight but there are things which only the investigating team can determine
7100645 i believe that in the end we will know what happened
7100646 we owe this to the victims and passengers the md is a type of plane which is flying at the moment and as such it is of interest to global aviation to know exactly what happened
7100647 no spanair flight operates unless the pilot is fully confident and sure that the plane is in adequate shape to fly
7100648 we are very confident of the information that we have because we physically went into that compound and identified the people
7100649 seventy six people all civilians and most of them women and children were martyred
7100650 19 women seven men and the rest children all under 15 years of age

7100652 allegations of breach of international humanitarian law and excessive use of force

7100654 by each passing day security is getting worse and we dont know who is responsible for it
7100655 it was a fantastic finish its always important to win but to win in this way with the passion and commitment of the players is much better
7100656 last season we were drawing these games this season we havent played really well but weve won two games and have six points
7100657 its good to look over my shoulder and see a scoring option like cisse on the bench

7100659 this is a great victory in breaking the siege and the beginning of what we hope will be more and more boats

7100661 we came to help the palestinian people in gaza to lift the siege
7100662 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through

7100671 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7100672 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7100673 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

7100685 a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7100686 somebody with 34 years of bad experience isnt perfectly qualified to be president someone with 34 years of good experience that makes a big difference so again i know its kindo of difficult to master its kind of difficult to feel sure footed in a lot of areas that you havent spent a long of time dealing with
7100687 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in and end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience

7100691 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7100692 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7100693 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7100694 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7100695 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7100696 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

7100704 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7100705 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7100706 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7100707 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7100708 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7100709 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7100710 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7100711 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7100712 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7100713 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7100714 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7100715 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7100716 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7100717 right now for most of these games when the player saves the princess and he starts walking away from the tower if he looks back hes going to see the princess at the top of the tower again
7100718 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7100719 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7100720 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7100721 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7100722 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7100723 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7100724 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7100725 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7100726 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7100727 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7100728 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7100729 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7100730 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7100731 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7100732 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7100733 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7100734 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7100735 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7100736 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7100737 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7100738 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7100739 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7100740 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7100741 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7100742 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7100743 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7100744 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7100745 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7100746 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7100747 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7100748 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7100749 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7100750 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7100751 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7100752 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7100753 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7100754 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7100755 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7100756 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7100757 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7100758 i can get him information that i believe is better than what he would get as president
7100759 i dont expect anybody to let me meet him in person
7100760 open secrecy free hearings on the ufo extraterrestrial presence on and around earth
7100761 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7100762 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7100763 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7100764 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7100765 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7100766 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7100767 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7100768 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7100769 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7100770 couldnt bear the idea of only being thought of as a journalist journalists are either two things either people who steal photographs off peoples mantelpieces when their child has been murdered or very brave people who go out to fantatic places and do something or other
7100771 irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
7100772 it has to be serious but it also has to be entertaining and relevant to peoples lives weve got to connect to what theyre interested in as opposed to following our own pet agendas
7100773 its lazy to say that by shortening the length youre just telling more simple stories newsnight tells impactful stories in 12 to 15 minutes
7100774 its important that students know how to manage it interpret it validate it and how to act on it
7100775 we have to emphasize communication skills the ability to work in teams and with people from different cultures
7100776 era con il suo compagno sono contento che siano morti lerba cattiva bisogna estirparla
7100777 i didnt have time to react i wasnt even able to hit my brakes or anything what stopped the forward motion of the car is that i ran into a big bear
7100778 you cant reject your bronze medal youre stripped of it
7100779 we knew that up front nigeria from midfield up front had very good players so we tried to make sure that we did not get up tight and just play our own game we wanted to play intelligently move the ball around we didnt want to run as much we wanted the ball to do the work
7100780 im guessing most players did not actually perform to their level because of the heat and you got tired in a little bit of time but we didnt make the rules they decided to play the game at 12 oclock which i dont think was a good idea
7100781 el rival supo como marcar a nuestros mejores jugadores hac a mucho calor y no tuvimos un buen partido desde el punto de vista t ctico pero esta era una final y hab a que ganarla
7100782 creo que merecimos ganar porque jugamos mejor f tbol argentina estuvo bien organizada hoy y supo aprovechar la oportunidad de ganar
7100783 por supuesto que estoy desilusionado hemos jugado bien pero lo que decide es quien anota el gol creo que nuestros muchachos han hecho un muy buen trabajo en este torneo ol mpico
7100784 we went up in a cable car and a toboggan down so that was really good fun
7100785 sometimes you see all these people walking around and its like oh my god i just walked past an olympic gold medalist
7100786 everything i imagined the olympics to be imagine that times 10 and thats how it feels to be in the olympics
7100787 are becoming apparent in the form of softening economic activity and rising unemployment
7100788 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
7100789 i have requested a six month waiver of the residence requirement
7100790 growing up bar coding was dinner conversation so i was familiar with it
7100791 and then one night while out to dinner i asked could we barcode sushi louisa and i love sushi and we thought why not apply the bar coding technology to see what food were eating
7100792 its not the fishermen and it might not even be the restaurants
7100793 most likely the mislabeling is occurring somewhere at the distribution level
7100794 many people are working on miniaturizing it bring the cost down and the speed to process up
7100795 sequencing is a chemical process there is no reason why we cant check the food on our plate and send the signal out to a database electronically gps used to be as big as refrigerators and only used by the government now its a common application in a phone
7100796 it didnt feel like a chore it wasnt time consuming at all
7100797 im hoping to get more public interest so it can become cheaper and more common
7100798 ive eaten it like 50 times since so i dont think so
7100799 we couldnt and we havent found any identification showing they are taliban
7100800 the coalition forces have made mistakes so many times and killed so many civilians we are asking president karzai to come here
7100801 on such a serious allegation as this one we have to look into it
7100802 were just trying to get to the bottom of this
7100803 if not reversed these developments together with a pace of growth that is likely to fall short of potential for a time should lead inflation to moderate later this year and next
7100804 at times of extraordinary volatility and dramatic risk re pricing maintaining price stability could be the best contribution that monetary policy could give to the return to financial stability
7100805 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7100806 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7100807 im excited about hitting the campaign trail with joe but the two of us cant do this alone we need your help to keep building this movement for change
7100808 sen obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7100809 sen biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help sen obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7100810 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7100811 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7100812 who among us is going to be able on day one to step in and end the war who among us understands what to do about pakistan who among us is going to pick up the phone and immediately interface with putin and tell him to lay off georgia because saakashvili is in real trouble who among us knows what theyre doing i have 35 years of experience
7100813 but 20 years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7100814 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7100815 mallika plays pareshs wife and an aspiring actress from a small town
7100816 she is from haryana her diction is so clear it helps a lot in bringing the best on screen
7100817 actresses generally take a lot of time in make up and outfit changes which delays the entire shooting many times mallika never created any such situation she even took immense interest in styling her look and clothes for the film

7100863 18 12 2 high exlosives the effects produced by diffuse phase i e fuel air explosions and solid explosives are very different in a diffuse phase explosion usually deflagration structural damage will tend to be uniform and omnidirectional and there will be relatively widespread evidence of burning scorching and blistering in contrast the rate of combustion of a solid explosive is extremely fast in comparison to the speed of sound therefore pressure does not equalize through the explosion volume and extremely high pressures are generated near the explosion at the location of the explosion there should be evidence of crushing splintering and shattering effects produced by the higher pressures away from the source of the explosion there is usually very little evidence of intense burning or scorching except where hot shrapnel or firebrands have landed on combustible materials
7100864 i cannot believe it it is more than i could ever hope for
7100865 i felt like it was my day because these conditions usually fit my surfing so well and there was all the potential to surf at my best i was so amped i got those two big scores straight away and just felt like i was free surfing with jihad khodr
7100866 it has been a tough time for me since i got back on the wqs
7100867 i was injured last year and with very few sponsorship so it has been a struggle but i am already looking forward to competing against the asp top 45 next year so stoked i cannot believe i have won it
7100868 it was davos day and there was not much i could do in the final
7100869 i am stoked to get this second place and i had a great time in france had a lot of fun competing in the good conditions today so it is all good for me
7100870 it has been tough this year learning against the worlds best surfers
7100871 i am trying to improve on every part of my surfing and it seems like i found some answers in this event it is a great confidence boost for the upcoming events and i hope i can keep the good roll going
7100872 i never expected i could make a semifinal here in such a big event with a prime status
7100873 i am not really into ratings and points but i was hoping for a 9th at least and i end up with a 3rd so i am really stoked
7100874 it has been a crazy year for europeans with so many of us reaching finals at most main events
7100875 miky picon tiago pires aritz aranburu and jeremy flores have been a great motivation for us all and it seems like things are paying off
7100876 i had a lot of fun today but i am still bumped with that 3rd the second one in two weeks
7100877 i will have to work on that last heat and victory because i want to win i have had several finals including one here three years ago but i want to win
7100878 i believe that professional surfing has really gone the right way and i am stoked to see that kind of moves rewarded
7100879 i usually paddle out with no plan except going for the best wave and then i just surf it the way i see it
7100880 i am happy i made it this far but it is disappointing to be so close and miss the final
7100881 it would have been great to win here twenty minutes from home in such a major event you want to win when you get that far so i am pretty bumped
7100882 there is a good feeling inbetween us europeans and it is good for our region to see that many guys at the top level
7100883 but when it comes to competing you are out there for yourself and you have to get the waves i have had some good results in ericeira so i am looking forward to the next event

7100888 op sy knie van die verhoog af daar voor almal
7100889 maar die konfrontasies wat deur al die ander vrouens in sy lewe geskep is het my laat besef dit is nie iets wat hy bedoel nie
7100890 ek het n nagmerrie gehad van hoe hy seks met n ander vrou het
7100891 toe ek hom daaroor uitvra het hy my nagmerrie bevestig dit was laas dinsdag
7100892 hy het my meer as een keer verneuk n hand vol en n hand vol kom neer op n klap in die gesig

7100906 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7100907 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7100908 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7100909 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7100910 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7100911 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7100912 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7100913 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7100914 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7100915 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7100916 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7100917 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually

7100922 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

7100930 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7100931 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7100932 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7100933 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7100934 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7100935 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7100936 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7100937 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7100938 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7100939 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7100940 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7100941 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7100942 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7100943 will look forward to it and dress up for it and remember it
7100944 freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction we didnt pass it to our children in the bloodstream it must be fought for protected and handed on for them to do the same or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our childrens children what it was once like in the united states where men were free
7100945 the battle for freedom and opportunity is never finally won in each generation those of us who believe in freedom in human potential in the idea that the strength of our society comes from the energy and industry and creativity of our people those of us who believe in these things must be ready to fight for them because the enemies of freedom are never finally vanquished they always live to fight another day today we can see the enemies of freedom preparing a renewed assault on our liberty they do not mean to harm us in fact they mean to help us but their ideas are out of date their methods have failed and their advance must be derailed
7100946 why david cameron is the heir to reagan amp thatcher
7100947 the defining challenge of the 21st century will be to face the reality that humanity shares a common fate on a crowded planet we have reached the beginning of the century with 6 6 billion people living in an interconnected global economy producing an astounding 60 trillion of output each year human beings fill every ecological niche on the planet from the icy tundra to the tropical rain forests to the deserts in some locations societies have outstripped the carrying capacity of the land resulting in chronic hunger environmental degradation and a large scale exodus of desperate populations we are in short in one anothers faces as never before crowded into an interconnected society of global trade migration ideas and yes risk of pandemic diseases terrorism refugee movements and conflict
7100948 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7100949 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7100950 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7100951 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7100952 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7100953 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7100954 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7100955 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7100956 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7100957 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7100958 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7100959 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7100960 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7100961 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7100962 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7100963 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7100964 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7100965 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7100966 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7100967 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7100968 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7100969 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7100970 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7100971 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7100972 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7100973 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7100974 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7100975 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7100976 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7100977 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7100978 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7100979 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7100980 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7100981 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7100982 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement
7100983 we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7100984 the german government expects russia to complete the withdrawal immediately in accordance with the six point plan also signed by russian president dmitry medvedev and pull back its troops to the lines held before the outbreak of hostilities as was agreed
7100985 according to our information russia has begun its withdrawal from georgia but not completed it
7100986 the german government expects the remaining russian troops also to pull back from the zone south of south ossetia and for them to be replaced by an international mechanism as quickly as possible in accordance with the agreements
7100987 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7100988 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7100989 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7100990 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7100991 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7100992 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7100993 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7100994 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7100995 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7100996 when i move on to my next job will i still be friends with
7100997 i tried to take my son to watch the live music but we realized it was only an ipod
7100998 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7100999 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7101000 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7101001 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7101002 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7101003 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7101004 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7101005 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7101006 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7101007 t he benefits of fda regulation relative to that in foreign countries could reasonably be put at some 5 000 casualties not lives per decade or 10 000 per decade for worst case scenarios in comparison it has been argued above that the cost of fda delay can be estimated at anywhere from 21 000 to 120 000 lives per decade given the uncertainties of the data these results must be interpreted with caution although it seems clear that the costs of regulation are substantial when compared to benefits
7101008 but drugs have larger effects on physical well being they are too important to be left to free enterprise

7101017 and in front of my parents luckily they didnt take it too seriously hahaha
7101018 my freshman and sophomore year i was really looking to play college basketball
7101019 i visited schools for basketball then and that was my goal the summer going into my junior year i started visiting schools for football and went to a few football camps i kind of made the decision that summer that football is what i wanted to do but i also wanted to finish my high school basketball career
7101020 i was a good high school basketball player and i enjoyed playing it but if i went to a college for basketball id be an undersized forward or maybe with a little bit of work an oversized guard
7101021 i didnt fit anywhere whereas my body type for a tight end was almost perfect plus there are things they can do with me in football football kind of chose me and chose my body type versus basketball
7101022 the kid is 255 but he has just grown into 255 he still looks skinny at 255 because hes so big he gets down the field in a hurry and he has great ball skills so anytime you have a tight end who can run that is at least an adequate blocker where he can sort of hold the point and not get his butt kicked at the line of scrimmage and that can vertically threaten all three levels of the field you know youve got something
7101023 whenever football ended i went straight to the hardwood and played that all the way through march and then played aau basketball in the summer so my time in the weight room wasnt really valuable time i was lifting but then my body never really got to recover because i was going right to basketball or i didnt get to lift because i had to go right to basketball practice this year after basketball i completely cut off basketball and really focused on just being in the weight room and concentrating on becoming bigger and stronger
7101024 i gave him my word that i would play on his team
7101025 i have improved my technique so much just since the beginning of camp this year there is still plenty to learn but i am so happy to be here at notre dame playing football again
7101026 when i was in the locker room the first day of practice i just kept telling myself that i have four years i have four years to play football i dont have to get everything accomplished in one day
7101027 playing high school football in texas is pretty intense it gets really intense sometimes but it isnt anything like it is right now in college here it seems like everybody can run a 4 5 the athleticism is amazing but i am starting to get used to it
7101028 coach mendoza is amazing he pushes us hard but he gets so much out of us and we love working for him he helped me put on a bunch of muscle since i got here and that has let me have at least a chance of holding my own
7101029 i need to work on my strength it is my biggest weakness
7101030 coach mendoza will get me up to speed soon though
7101031 i think that being here has really given me an advantage not so much over the other guys in this class but just for myself i have had more time to learn the playbook and now i can go out and play football without constantly worrying about if i am in the correct position and making the reads
7101032 there are so many great players and coaches to learn from that i will just keep working hard looking to improve every day
7101033 i was getting a little homesick at first but you have to grow up sometime and being here with the rest of this class is such a help we are really tight
7101034 i have been working hard and despite a few bumps and bruises my body feels pretty good and my technique is getting better i am excited that my teammates and i are all working hard to improve
7101035 i didnt even think about playing football after high school until before my senior season when my high school coach told me that he thought i could play d 1 then schools started to call but some days i look up at the stadium and the golden dome and i cant believe that it is actually happening to me
7101036 i love this poem for the way it departs from one convention of weddings there is a moment in most ceremonies that leaves me a little mournful the one when its pronounced that two amazing individuals each of whom i love separately have become one it makes it seem as if loves ultimate effect is to reduce by half the number of wonderful people in the world and im pretty sure that we cant spare them i prefer to think of it as a pooling of resources a collaboration that will allow each of you to better reach for destinies beyond what we have come to know today in my mind rather than melting rather than squeezing into one your vow is to forever amplify one anothers unique capacity to live well to engender beauty to nurture justice to generate love thinking of it this way allows me to celebrate without reserve this most inspiring and joyful council between equals my wish is that the destinies for which you together reach will enrich your own lives and spirits and immensely as they already do ours you beautiful two
7101037 we were wondering if you would be willing to speak for two minutes during our wedding ceremony matt and i want to have five of our favorite friends and family members say something its kind of like a quaker wedding except that were limiting the number of people and were asking you in advance there are very few parameters involved you could read a poem or a book excerpt tell a story about matt and me give wedding advice talk metaphorically pontificate about love kind of like a toast you could even go under two minutes if you want and perhaps a little over two minutes if someone else wants to go under well have to see how it goes i want you to feel free to say no if youd rather not speak if it makes you anxious youll dread the wedding and that would not be a good thing let me know what you think and if the answer is yes let me know if you want less than two minutes hoping you feel more honored than annoyed s

7101050 people simply should not take laptops on holiday with them they are taking their office with them and they just shouldnt do it
7101051 the rise in mobile phone and internet technology has already affected our weekends and now it is invading annual holidays sensible bosses and workers should insist that holidays are computer free
7101052 people worry about a backlog and that things will be missed while they are away they feel a need to be constantly online and checking their emails this insecurity is endemic to the service based industries
7101053 i can understand why people take mobile phones but they should only be used sparingly as a security blanket they should be kept switched off most of the time
7101054 sab amos que esto estaba pasando y a lo mejor se queda corto bitar y el atraso es mayor

7101056 una m s de las respuestas tard as del gobierno el problema no son los recursos es la mala gesti n en la implementaci n de los proyectos y mientras el gobierno no supere la burocracia y siga privilegiando designaciones de pol ticos y no de t cnicos van a pasar estas cosas que da an a la comunidad

7101069 if we maybe took some of our chances in the first half we would not have found ourselves in this situation
7101070 the fans have the right to be unhappy south africa are a proud nation they want to be winners and want to back a winning side we will never go out and lose a game on purpose
7101071 it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position
7101072 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7101073 im very happy with our performance although it was not error free
7101074 if you look at the intensity of the game we did what had to be done but we did it the hard way today i am pleased
7101075 and perhaps posterity will thank me for having shown it that the ancients did not know everything
7101076 i think one of the things wrong with my party is that we are too timid
7101077 as i have gone around the country the last couple of years if i had to do synthesize in one adjective what one national democrats think about the party the consensus on the word would be timidity
7101078 is america at this time in its history as focused as it is in its place in the world are they going to turn it over to a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate maybe
7101079 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7101080 whoever the next president is is going to have to know what he or she wants to do beyond a tactical move in other words there is a tactic and a strategy putting a cap on troops is a tactic cutting funding is a tactic making judgment about surging is a tactic but at the end of the day how are americas interests going to be preserved enhanced or diminished by whatever we leave behind
7101081 let me put it this way you didnt hear any one of them get in this debate at all till they announced for president i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic
7101082 and john says look if this is civil war we cant in good conscience keep our troops in the middle of it so examine johns rationale john says ok we got to go in there to solidify this give a chance for a political settlement so this civil war doesnt become a civil war but if it becomes a civil war we cant stay there johns said it would be immoral to keep american troops in the midst of that but when you ask john ok john you dont think its a civil war now but what happens if there is a full blown civil war and the iraqis are not helping us the government you say you cant keep the troops there ok john what do you do
7101083 one of the reasons that im running is i am not basing my confidence on being able to lead this country on foreign policy based upon merely an intuitive faith in my own judgment i am basing it on the things i recommended in bosnia kosovo iraq korea that have turned out to be true

7101092 it is harsh to lose the game but it is fair to say fulham played well
7101093 they were sharp and didnt allow us enough chances to win the game in the midfield we were dominated we werent sharp or quick enough and we suffered in there
7101094 jessica went from a size 8 to a size 4 pretty quickly
7101095 the baby always comes first but jessica definitely set goals for herself

7101235 if you look at the intensity of the game we did what had to be done but we did it the hard way today i am pleased

7101237 many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7101238 for the moment kaladze and maldini are back and im hopeful they are going to perform well as a consequence we dont need a new centre back
7101239 it was not nice being out there especially after i felt we had the firepower to win the game and the opportunities
7101240 if we maybe took some of our chances in the first half we would not have found ourselves in this situation
7101241 the fans have the right to be unhappy south africa are a proud nation they want to be winners and want to back a winning side we will never go out and lose a game on purpose

7101270 we only need to look back to the recent passage of the repeal of the hiv travel and immigration ban to see the type of leadership we can expect from sen biden on the issues important to our community
7101271 it was because of his determination and tenacity that we were able to see this relic of discrimination against people living with hiv aids torn down
7101272 if the support sen biden has proven on our issues is any indication of the type of vice president he will be than our community can be assured that sen obama has chosen a thoughtful and staunch advocate for equality as his closest adviser

7101280 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7101281 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7101282 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7101283 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7101284 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7101285 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7101286 in the case of bear stearns it is not clear from publicly available information how much contagion there would have been had it been allowed to fail
7101287 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7101288 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7101289 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7101290 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts
7101291 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7101292 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7101293 much of it is privately profitable but socially wasteful churning driven by regulatory arbitrage and tax efficiency considerations
7101294 one of the defining dynamics of 2008 has been the emerging wave of new young voters getting involved and storming the gates of the traditional political establishment
7101295 imagination was given to man to compensate him for what he is not a sense of humor to console him for what he is
7101296 if the world were merely seductive that would be easy if it were merely challenging that would be no problem but i arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world this makes it hard to plan the day
7101297 it is now evident that speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought and it is now even harder to accept the agencys laughable assertion that excessive speculation has not contributed to rising energy prices
7101298 difficult to comprehend how the cftc would allow a trader
7101299 to date the cftc has found that supply and demand fundamentals offer the best explanation for the systematic rise in oil prices
7101300 regardless of their classification the cftcs market surveillance group scrutinizes daily the positions of all large traders both commercial and non commercial to guard against market manipulation
7101301 when the cftc granted the 1991 hedging exemption to j aron a division of goldman sachs it signaled a major shift that has since allowed investors to accumulate enormous positions for purely speculative purposes
7101302 legitimate businesses that hedge and take physical delivery of oil are being trampled by the speculators who are in the market purely to make profit
7101303 investment banks had been frustrated with the established exchange because they really were never able to get control of it
7101304 have catastrophic economic effects on millions of already stressed u s consumers
7101305 commodities and currencies are clearly the strongest business they have right now
7101306 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7101307 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7101308 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7101309 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7101310 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7101311 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7101312 even with the surge of troops in a city of 6 million people youre talking about a ratio that would still be roughly above one to 100
7101313 its bound to draw down support that we need in other parts of iraq including anbar province
7101314 i think well only have to accept responsibility for the war if we remain silent
7101315 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7101316 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7101317 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7101318 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7101319 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things

7101325 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7101326 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7101327 i looked at the medal around my neck and its such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls
7101328 it just brought tears to my eyes and im more than thrilled
7101329 you see tears theyre tears of happiness though we came a long way this tournament
7101330 shes been our leader for four years she took on a great team with a lot of potential it was a little rusty in the beginning but look where she got us
7101331 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7101332 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7101333 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7101334 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7101335 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7101336 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7101337 we are prepared to weather a 40 mile an hour storm much like our usual summer thunder storms however the real concerns could be possible tornadoes fallen trees and the unknown amount of rainfall
7101338 i couldnt stop thinking about the race you get down on yourself
7101339 at least now i have something positive to think about
7101340 if youre in front keep in front if youre not get in front
7101341 we didnt speak from the time we left the stadium crying thursday till practice yesterday
7101342 i said we didnt come this far not to leave without gold
7101343 we didnt get it individually but lets get it together tonight we did
7101344 i think i was able to show the world that tonight i honestly believe tuesday the pace i was on if i didnt cramp id have been able to pull it off and run fast at least tonight i was able to prove that
7101345 it feels great to have my second gold medal in these games followed up with an olympic record i cant be any happier than this
7101346 everybody ran a great leg and all i wanted to do was have a safe baton pass and do my job
7101347 when you have a combination of runners like that youre bound to do something great
7101348 going into the relay we all came together as one
7101349 we wanted to run as a team it wasnt about individuals in the relay i was happy to finish off what the first three runners did
7101350 when its a closer race sometimes you fight more and youre not running as relaxed
7101351 i think it could have been a world record if had been a closer race but we all went out there and ran comfortable
7101352 its not easy to achieve this for me after hard work after so much effort
7101353 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7101354 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7101355 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue

7101363 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7101364 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7101365 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses treating your neighbor as youd like to be treated
7101366 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7101367 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7101368 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7101369 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7101370 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave
7101371 would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose which along with a pair of jet black eyes was offered as proof of cherokee blood
7101372 the thought occurred to me maybe that would be a good slogan for her grandson
7101373 glenn miller tommy dorsey benny goodman harry james i dont think there was a one from that era that we didnt have at the blue moon
7101374 black slicked back hair and his perpetual wise guy grin
7101375 gramps is probably too busy telling one of his jokes or arguing with toot their version of the hawaiian word
7101376 toot notices but shes polite enough to bite her lip and offer dessert her instincts warn her against making a scene
7101377 every morning she woke up at five a m and changed from the frowsy muu muus sic she wore around the apartment into a tailored suit and high heeled pumps
7101378 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7101379 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7101380 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7101381 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7101382 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7101383 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7101384 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7101385 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7101386 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7101387 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7101388 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7101389 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7101390 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm
7101391 i used to think i dont know whos the supervisor here me or her
7101392 when stanley was still alive they would go on cruises around the islands and theyd do nothing but play bridge
7101393 we are very used to succeeding on a significant level and its disappointing when we dont or cant
7101394 this isnt about rebuilding retooling or anything this is about going for it thats our approach its pedal to the metal thats what every move is based on what every attempted move is based on with an eye toward the present and an eye toward the future were going for it
7101395 this is one of the most excited ive been going into the season
7101396 in 2004 i was jacked up because i felt great about that year i feel great where this team is headed right now
7101397 we beat the cowboys last year the redskins we should have beaten them the first time the giants we should have beaten them both times
7101398 its not just teams in our division its the nfc period i feel like we can compete with all of them if you ask those teams theyll tell you the same that we have the type of team you have to look out for we have the players we just have to put it together
7101399 we have a lot of hard work ahead of us
7101400 we did finish last in the nfc east it hasnt been easy and it wont be easy once we get into the grind its tough to climb back up that ladder
7101401 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7101402 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7101403 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue

7101407 i came out in a sweat shirt and nikes i thought we were going to play basketball
7101408 i put all my traditional beliefs behind me and was heavily into drugs
7101409 he urged me to get back on the spiritual path
7101410 we ask the creator to come and heal us from that
7101411 back in the day before you went to war or out on the warpath there were ceremonies to prepare you
7101412 there were ceremonies that cleansed you when you came home so you didnt bring negativity back to your tribe
7101413 beliefs and rituals are what we used to deal with traumatic things that happened
7101414 it kept us healthy for hundreds and thousands of years
7101415 it empowers them to go out and format themselves in a different way

7101424 they do not have quality looms so we started procuring from other agencies like cooptex
7101425 police personnel want better quality cloth and ours does not match their expectations so they have stopped purchasing from us
7101426 the noise is devastating and the invasion of privacy unacceptable
7101427 i think if theyre too noisy for new york then theyre too noisy for us
7101428 we are too small this areas too congested its totally unacceptable
7101429 personally glad that we have a helicopter tour in town it has been a plus for my customers a plus for the activities that i can direct them to
7101430 and i can honestly say that i have never heard of so many people hearing so well
7101431 i hear the helicopter occasionally i hear motorcycles occasionally i hear trucks occasionally i hear drunks walking down the street occasionally
7101432 correct me if im wrong but are we a tourist town as we advertise ourselves or are we a bedroom community of some mystical place
7101433 there was a single person in this room that he needed to remind that were a tourist town i think we need to be reminded that people live here

7101442 its my helicopter its my business and if i want to fly at night personally im going to do it
7101443 im not going to go out and do tours or generate income but i enjoy flying
7101444 that tour constitutes a lot of money to me that tour constitutes a lot of advertising for me its my highest exposure

7101448 i would say he was possessed by something stronger than the tornado
7101449 i saw my twine ball start to scoot across the floor and toward the black funnel i knew then what i had to do

7101486 we should have won our work rate was good and we caused them one or two problems
7101487 the goal weve given away we should be higher than that when youre going to let balls into your area as easily with owen around its going to count and its cost us
7101488 i didnt see the penalty incident it wasnt one of kevins better ones im sure from that point onwards it gave the crowd a boost
7101489 it was important we scored we didnt and its cost us a result
7101490 i am immensely proud it would be easy to highlight mistakes which led to the second goal but they have given absolutely everything
7101491 they have given a good account of themselves against one of the top teams in the country and i have said they have got to leave here with their heads held high
7101492 they have got to take belief after that performance as we pushed liverpool all the way and we would have been disappointed to come off the field with a point the way the game went we have to take the result on the chin and we will come back stronger
7101493 we have goalscorers in the team we had to be organised defensively and they have worked their socks off and stuck to their plan of keeping their shape as you cant go gung ho at a place like liverpool
7101494 i thought it was a cracking game a smashing game we are a little disappointed with some of the goals we have conceded but it was a fantastic result for us
7101495 villa are a top six or seven side they have got some excellent players and they cause you some problems

7101551 the christian action league has been in support of this legislation for a long time
7101552 it has never made sense to us that the organization that can approve or reject the labeling on a box of cereal or halt the production of a new flavored cough medicine would have no say over how tobacco is marketed
7101553 the pending legislation is carefully crafted to ensure the fdas new tobacco related responsibilities do not in any way impede or take resources from its current responsibilities
7101554 while the marlboro man and joe camel might be schemes of the past the tobacco industry continues to find ways to target children through their advertising
7101555 the tobacco industry has introduced cigarettes smokeless tobacco products and so called little cigars in an array of candy fruit and alcohol flavors that mask the harshness of the products and make them more appealing to children
7101556 tobacco continues to be at risk for further regulation and taxation
7101557 the fda has authority to monitor food drugs and medical devices and tobacco products do not and should not fall into any of those categories
7101558 its obvious that north carolinas senate representation would protect the industry
7101559 but lawmakers who think tobacco is already regulated enough may want to consider use of the drug kills more than 400 000 americans a year and racks up nearly 100 billion in health care costs and despite health warnings every day another 1 000 children take up the habit
7101560 plainly this product destroys the human body which in corinthians is so justly described as the temple of god
7101561 for us in the faith community these statistics are especially tragic because every day we must bury mothers fathers sisters and brothers who die early from preventable deaths caused by tobacco addiction that more often than not began at a young age
7101562 a giant step toward ending the special protection the tobacco industry has enjoyed for too long and at such great cost to the nations health
7101563 knowing that first time users will find smoking unpleasant the tobacco industry carefully manipulates the product to make it less harsh by adding sugars and chemicals that numb the throat
7101564 congress has the means to curb the cycle of allurement and addiction of disease and death caused by tobacco they owe it to the families of america to do just that and to do it now
7101565 let us pray that our lawmakers do the right thing and that sen burr reconsiders his threat to filibuster
7101566 the fda is the right agency to regulate tobacco products because it is the only agency with the combination of regulatory experience scientific expertise and public health mandate
7101567 elizabeth police made two arrests following a terrifying incident where a woman had a car stolen while she was sitting in it
7101568 given the way the suspension was chewed up on the ford id say they were travelling around 80km h or more when they hit
7101569 we discussed for months and months whether it was a worthwhile thing given one of the goals was to get me to the olympics vince took a significant pay cut to sign a two year deal with canterbury rugby but he was willing to make that sacrifice to enable me to pursure my dreams
7101570 we paid 5000 out of our own pockets to bring our house contents from sydney to christchurch we relocated our entire lives only to find out oh my gosh what are we going to do were now effectively stuck there and theres nothing for me to do theres not even a womens national league in new zealand
7101571 people are putting in the hard yards making the effort relocating their lives for very little money and were talking very little money all for the love of the game this whole thing has done nothing but put us in more debt and now i dont even have a team to play for this season
7101572 im one of the older players but what are our younger players coming into nothing thats what
7101573 this is it for me i guess ive never come to a point in my life where i simply dont know what im doing right now theres no plan and im hoping some sort of miracle happens
7101574 a lot of us couldnt keep it in its gone above basketball now its about our livelihood it feels like youre homeless
7101575 im angry and disappointed but it runs deeper than that this affects me differently because im a mother and ive already sacrificed so much
7101576 we havent heard from the ceo since weve been here there needs to be some accountability the players deserve answers and we need some certainty around the tall ferns programme
7101577 you get your yellow slip while youre away on olympic duty the timing of the release was pretty devastating some of these girls may never play basketball again thats the part that worries me
7101578 that has been the hardest part of this whole saga the fact that the players have been on the other side of the world competing in the biggest event of their lives while at home their team was crumbling
7101579 last year i missed the boat i waited too late and missed out on thousands of dollars i could of made with a home based business and hundreds of people i could have helped make money for the holidays
7101580 not this year i am ready for september 1st with new businesses to complement my main business cruise to cash and a new improved back office to keep up

7101584 i have worked with sen joe biden for 15 years on the senate judiciary committee and have watched and admired his work on the foreign relations committee in my view he is one of the greats in the united states senate he has taken his work extremely seriously continually adds to what is a very substantial body of knowledge in foreign policy and is always easy to work with i believe he adds a foreign policy dimension to the ticket that will be well served he will be a great vice president for the american people

7101597 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7101598 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7101599 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7101600 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts
7101601 all three have allowed themselves to be used as quasi fiscal agents of the state providing subsidies to banks and other highly leveraged institutions
7101602 the feds reputation for maintaining price stability has been severely dented
7101603 much of it is privately profitable but socially wasteful churning driven by regulatory arbitrage and tax efficiency considerations
7101604 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity

7101611 how can you be paying a flip tax youre not flipping
7101612 ripetono sempre gli stessi errori eppure non imparano mai gli umani sono davvero esseri stupidi e tristi
7101613 i didnt like the stereotypes and i wasnt satisfied in just acknowledging myself as a pinoy pilipino ako it wasnt enough for me i know there are better ways to be appreciated and to be acknowledged in london as a filipino so i had to look at other ethnicities to see how they did it in my pursuit of that i started meeting like minded people
7101614 what we want to do is create a sustainable identity and focal point for filipinos in this country by promoting the philippines its people and its culture by offering support and services providing that to non filipinos as well as filipinos
7101615 that might help them become better citizens within the uk because they are more grounded and they understand where they come from what it takes for them to succeed because they know how hard it is back home how people have struggled how their parents have come to this country just to make a life we are not just about us and now we are about the future
7101616 i can see that everyone is very enthusiastic about the projects and they are positive in their thinking about the young filipinos who are now growing up in the uk
7101617 when we stand as a people everybody will know who a filipino is they wont know bad stereotypes and theyll appreciate it for something that filipinos are also proud to be known for not smokey mountain but palawan food not just balut and pansit
7101618 im not that sure when it will happen but id like to go up to a non filipino say hello and they ask me where are you from and when i say im from the philippines i want them to say kumusta ka thats what im going for
7101619 i want proof from emergency hospital wards that there are fewer kids being brought in with binge drinking related problems since the tax was introduced in the may budget i want evidence from the police that theyre reporting less binge drinking related offences among young people since the tax came in they are the two things we want to be convinced of before wed vote for the measure
7101620 it is obvious that 17 year old boys getting behind the wheel of a high performance car is asking for trouble mr carpenter said
7101621 weve got to stop that from happening its about the safety of the broader community and the safety of the young kids themselves
7101622 and ordinary people do not want to be terrorised by hoons some of these accidents have come ploughing into peoples houses
7101623 but as a general rule young kids invariably boys dont need as their first vehicle to be driving a high performance car mr carpenter said
7101624 despite an increasingly difficult enterprise spending environment in the u s and parts of europe reasonable growth expectations strength in emerging countries currency and product cycles should be enough to drive some upside for each company
7101625 theyre very high growth economies but theyre still subject to volatility
7101626 i think chinas just kind of a who knows its so hot it has to come down eventually
7101627 even if goes from 25 percent to 15 percent year over year growth it can cause some volatility
7101628 youre going to hear notebooks doing well for both companies
7101629 i think that hp continues to be very upbeat about what it can do with eds and will go to great lengths on the conference call to convince people of that
7101630 share gains on the inkjet side combined with stronger emerging market growth on the laser side should drive another quarter of mid single digit revenue growth in printers and operating margin above 15 percent
7101631 even against a tough comparison we expect hp to maintain double digit pc revenue growth on strength outside of the u s
7101632 if it does continue to strengthen you could see some of that be a headwind to top line growth
7101633 its one of the most amazing growth stories weve ever seen
7101634 we dont anticipate microsoft getting into a dominant position in the server market through our 2005 forecast period
7101635 because there will continue to be competition from linux unix and netware those other operating systems have not just folded up shop and gone away
7101636 most enterprise organizations are going to be heterogeneous we dont see any one operating system dominating
7101637 we are a financial institution we take care of peoples money we dont reboot servers were not going to tell people we cant do something because the systems down
7101638 if microsoft wants more of our dollar microsoft will have to be as reliable as an ibm mainframe
7101639 todays big news is that microsoft has tapped comedian jerry seinfeld for their newest advertising campaign he is to appear

7101733 entertainment is not revival although that is an obvious statement it is sadly not always understood too often it is assumed that an atmosphere of revival can be achieved by using music lighting and techno media presentation highly organized events with attractive multi coloured brochures can generate excitement and draw huge crowds but it is misleading to think that having a good time equates to spiritual revival it is very easy to be negative about such displays but the problem remains that we lack spiritual vitality and life and we are often boringly out of touch and tradition or else events like that would not seem so attractive to young people the sad fact is that we have an idea in our heads of something far better but in our hearts and experience too often there is not much that is better
7101734 for months ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join in me in making washington work for the american people
7101735 i searched for a leader who understands the rising costs confronting working people and who will always put their dreams first
7101736 i searched for a leader who sees clearly the challenges facing america in a changing world with our security and standing set back by eight years of a failed foreign policy
7101737 a leader who shares my vision of an open government that calls all citizens democrats republicans and independents to a common purpose above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7101738 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7101739 joe biden is that rare mix for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7101740 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7101741 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7101742 to have the advice experience support and judgment of joe biden is something that will make him an even better candidate and a better president
7101743 it shatters the critics that said that he lacks the experience
7101744 nobody republican or democrat liberal or conservative can say that senator biden is not well informed and he has a reputation of working both sides of the isle so theres no question that hes a great addition to the ticket
7101745 joe biden has a solid record and though like any politician you may not agree on every issue his general tone has been one that we know and appreciate
7101746 hoe ziet het dat dan uit voor die mensen al gewend zijn om te vragen aan de engelen gidsen en de gene zijde

7101752 ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join in me in making washington work for the american people i searched for a leader who understands the rising costs confronting working people and who will always put their dreams first
7101753 a leader who sees clearly the challenges facing america in a changing world with our security and standing set back by eight years of a failed foreign policy a leader who shares my vision of an open government that calls all citizens democrats republicans and independents to a common purpose above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7101754 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7101755 entergys support for this project is indicative of its benefit to the community entergy strategically deploys its grants to a wide range of high impact programs
7101756 we are making real progress towards opening our store next year
7101757 man is a rational animal who always loses his temper when called upon to act in accordance with the dictates of reason
7101758 i once paraphrased mark twain on the senate floor there is no distinctly native american criminal class except congress
7101759 it takes two things to open members and money and we cant do it without both
7101760 if we have extra money were not going to make a profit
7101761 the idea would be to give that money back to the members in one form or another
7101762 its not going to be quite so polished but i think it will be a place that people will feel comfortable at feel like theyre getting a good value and with every purchase you make you wont feel like youre buying it from some company but from something youre a part of
7101763 they bring people together provide healthier food at a more affordable cost and its something that supports local farmers and the existence of a co op grocery in new orleans would really foster a sense of community and be something that would help bring the community together
7101764 all of our tenants in the healing center will relate to one or another aspects of that definition of sustainability

7101768 me cuesta creer que todav a haya quienes despu s de la experiencia que hemos vivido tomen medidas unilaterales son tiempos de consenso no de andar a los sopapos y queriendo imponer cosas
7101769 si no se puede avanzar est claro que uno no dinamita ese puente
7101770 pero hay que ir al congreso y ah hay muchas cosas que quedaron pendientes hay infinidad de temas por trabajar
7101771 this country was formed for the white not black man
7101772 whats with these guys we must have been waiting for 15 minutes
7101773 hi george say whats with that group ahead of us theyre rather slow arent they
7101774 oh yes thats a group of blind firefighters they lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year so we always let them play for free anytime
7101775 thats so sad i think i will say a special prayer for them tonight
7101776 good idea and im going to contact my ophthalmologist buddy and see if theres anything he can do for them
7101777 longshots is one underdog thats hard to love and harder still to champion
7101778 because longshots never escapes the sense of being too contrived it never really gets the crowd on its feet
7101779 it includes some of the expected elements of any film from this genre but without the usual hollywood supercharging
7101780 the saga is an undeniably heartwarming one about perseverance hard work and pride in community and who could criticize that
7101781 there are few movies out right now more genuine than this cinderella story
7101782 all hail anna faris fake bimbo par excellence master of the birdbrained double take our reigning queen of intelligent stupidity
7101783 perhaps only anna faris could make a female empowerment comedy produced by adam sandler tolerable
7101784 the house bunny pulls a rabbit out of a hat with anna faris whose comic charms to say nothing of her physical ones work some magic on this otherwise weak effort
7101785 it knows what it is and doesnt apologize for it what it is incidentally is junk
7101786 nice to know that there is still somewhere to turn for gratuitous violence fuel inefficient action and rude one liners
7101787 death race may be a loud lowbrow piece of pulp but its also crackling entertainment the very definition of a cheap thrill
7101788 what do you get when you supercharge roger cormans 1975 b movie death race 2000 a fried cheeseball
7101789 it is an assault on all the senses including common walking out i had the impression i had just seen the video game and was still waiting for the movie
7101790 individual ingredients are recognizable but the finished product is shapeless glop while it might be filling no one with any taste could possibly call it good
7101791 why would barack obama be friends with someone who bombed the capitol and is proud of it do you know enough to elect barack obama
7101792 the response from our viewers clearly confirms that our sports division is delivering the most relevant and engaging spanish language olympics coverage to u s hispanics
7101793 what has impressed me most is the way the retailers are supporting blu ray and how much space they are giving over to blu ray discs
7101794 before there can be a union job there has to be a job and despite all the grandiose talk about the coming bonanza new media hasnt yet started raining money the truth is that for new media production to realize its undeniably vast potential and create all those jobs we want our members to have it must be given the room to evolve and grow
7101795 i think what really stands logic on its head is the idea that the way to organize union work is to encourage signatories to produce non union under our contracts
7101796 the u k is a huge market with a very large talent pool we are no longer solely focused on hollywood and waiting passively for the talent to come to us
7101797 the opening date of the film was shifted around like the planchette on a ouija board a sure sign that the studio knew it had one of those hollywood we have a problem movies that needed to arrive in theaters in a relatively quiet part of the summer season
7101798 rainn wilson is off his rocker to take this role
7101799 the rocker is a grubby little redemption comedy that in every way feels like a consignment shop jack black vehicle
7101800 its a lot of fun its spirit is genuine and even with the odd vomit gag fundamentally sweet
7101801 at some point i dont know when she should have a show shes on the short list its a very short list shes at the top
7101802 a program hosted by ms maddow will almost certainly be a closer ideological fit with keith olbermanns
7101803 making a film about transsexuals and their problems in iran was a difficult task
7101804 it became something of a challenge as i could see myself more as a fighter than as a filmmaker
7101805 the film is an entirely false and distorted account of what took place
7101806 weve spent so much time in the past 12 months talking about deception that i worry we havent found time to talk about the other side of the coin invention
7101807 its what those in the posh seats might call art and what the rest of us would broadly call entertainment
7101808 there will have to be some savings we will know more about how much in the next two months
7101809 postproduction and distribution of films has become more complex especially as releasing films simultaneously
7101810 a weaker economy equals less consumer discretionary income equals less propensity to upgrade to higher speed internet tiers and digital video packages
7101811 we have a lot of work to do but things are coming into place
7101812 to consolidate opportunities for the developing of the partys media resources and promotion of its image
7101813 boxoffice receipts for the u k and ireland market as reported by edi were flat year on year at 424 million pounds 792 8 million for the six month period ended june 2008
7101814 within this context it is encouraging that we increased our own boxoffice on the same period last year
7101815 i dont think we are done in the u k i suspect we will do more in the u k and we will want to expand the business
7101816 to mitigate the impact of these increased costs these plaintiffs have been obliged to bring aboard equity investors and
7101817 this is what we have flying around in the air in burbank
7101818 it was the worst ive ever seen in a picture from the modern era
7101819 if anyone is forced to call 911 and as a result something becomes a police matter you cant abandon the process you need to cooperate and allow the police to do what they need to do i wasnt being courageous it was a situation i needed to see through in order to protect my family
7101820 im feeling good and doing everything that i need to do to stay healthy i dont have to return to california until next month for my next round of treatments right now im taking the medication as i am scheduled to take it
7101821 we wife lisa niemi and i have been walking our dogs and enjoying some of the restaurants also we stay in the hotel so i can rest for filming
7101822 i have four titanium plates in my neck ive had 14 surgeries over the years
7101823 paula wasnt about to begin another season of idol living in constant pain auditions for the show begin in new york at the end of august and she wanted to make sure she was feeling her best before hitting the road
7101824 we dont know if its a boy or a girl plus we are going to put him in a black room itll be a goth baby so it doesnt matter if it is a boy or a girl
7101825 kissing him wasnt that bad but he did have to stop and shave in the middle of a scene even though hed shaved that morning the man has really got some serious beard on him
7101826 its not the kids its not the gaggle of girls its the gaggle of parents the parents are the ones who want the pictures the girls are too shy so its really sweet i love to wave at them and stuff its really funny
7101827 the parents are the most excited the kids are like mum lets go and shes like no were taking a picture its really exciting for everyone in your class really truthfully i love the kids its a pleasure
7101828 singing in the movie was fun because i got to record the song and then i lip synched to my own voice because im scared to sing in front of people in real life
7101829 i dont have it in me id do it but not professionally or anything like that i mean not on a broadway stage thats for sure
7101830 he wont be delivering speeches instead hell be anteing up for a disabled veterans poker tournament as well as participating in americas second harvest events packing lunches for local food banks
7101831 and hell be sitting in on a panel discussion on combating global poverty
7101832 i feel like it is long overdue and i think someday people will look back on this like women not having the right to vote and segregation and anything else that seems ridiculous like we all dont have the same rights
7101833 theyre on a scheduled hiatus and shell be back next month its business as usual
7101834 shed need to have a sense of humour to go out with a guy like me
7101835 i would love kids ive just got to find the right lady im an old softie me i send flowers when they need to be sent and stuff like that
7101836 im thoughtful and sweet im not as cold as you think i am
7101837 i just learned to ride recently i guess because i was the youngest of three and my parents were really busy they just assumed that i already knew also we lived on a hill
7101838 it was a cigarette case that hitler had given her with a diamond swastika on the top
7101839 i said thats gotta be worth a lot of money and she came out with this revelation when i looked at the history research she had parties where she entertained hitler so she was like a social hostess
7101840 she hated her first husband because he was so domineering i think she was ashamed she hated hitler and didnt really want to talk about the tryst once it was out there
7101841 i think she reluctantly told me because i asked about the cigarette case and immediately regretted it
7101842 she said that she tried to tell movie mogul louis b meyer about hitler and he said he didnt want to talk about hitler and he told her not to talk about hitler i bet she didnt tell anyone except me
7101843 she said she met hitler and was forced into a relationship with him because her husband was making millions of dollars from him
7101844 reports that actor jean reno is in the hospital due to a heart attack are false he is vacationing in the caribbean and went to a local hospital as a precaution for some discomfort he was feeling due to heartburn and gastroenteritis
7101845 it was definitely not a heart attack he is fine and healthy and enjoying the rest of his vacation travelling in the caribbean
7101846 i think he was just enjoying vacation and probably ate a little too much spicy caribbean food
7101847 to be honest i hadnt seen any bond films before i did that one but i did not have a great relationship to bond at all and i didnt go back and see the other movies before making casino royale
7101848 there is nothing wrong with the other ones they were perfect for their time but this script was fairly radical for a lot of people and we had to catch up
7101849 im very proud to have been a part of it daniel craig was excellent he is a fantastic and a great guy to work with we were a very tight unit making bond
7101850 oprah winfrey has appeared on the cover of o since its launch in 2000 and she will continue to do so in fact shoots for three upcoming covers will take place in early september
7101851 charlotte and sam do this party every year with publicist amanda silverman
7101852 the photographers must have caught on because they were outside the hotel sam and lindsay were livid and just left to go do their own thing
7101853 it was an investment deal that was no good for anyone and well fight the lawsuit vigorously
7101854 its a real blow to the people that loved him im just shocked the real effect of not having him around is going to just hit us more and more both personally and professionally
7101855 we were really close he was supposed to do my make up this morning so that we could catch up i think that the world just got a little less pretty
7101856 once you master a horse but it also masters you you gain more confidence in yourself
7101857 when you can mount it and move it and move along with it that is a hard won and very real accomplishment
7101858 actors see me differently now they think im taken more seriously now the perception is that theatre people are taken seriously
7101859 devil may care is a period book which is set in the 1960s and it really wouldnt fit as one of the films that eon has been producing recently
7101860 he is working all the time so scarlett wants to hold off until the election is over
7101861 he wants to start working on the video before the end of the summer and release it in time for the holidays
7101862 i sang this song called will you marry me i picked this girl that i knew and sang it to her at the end everybody was saying congratulations
7101863 the couple originally denied reports that they were pregnant in an attempt to take back the right to release the joyous news themselves
7101864 it always makes me laugh when people say is she isnt she its like eventually you will know so just chill out for a minute
7101865 he was not drunk he was drinking hours and hours before thats dui rumour gonna go away
7101866 these guys who say i cant wait to retire hot dog and after about a week theyre ready to pull their hair out keep busy and youll stay younger and healthier and youll be around a hell of a lot longer
7101867 ive got my bong award on my fireplace its the only award ive ever won im so proud
7101868 he tracked me down in the u k and said he wanted to work with me hed become slightly obsessed with alan partridge for a period which in america is quite odd
7101869 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity
7101870 its serious boxing you have to go get a trainer i have to register with the mature boxing association
7101871 i dont care who it is its for charity ive been beaten up by the press so i dont care if i get a few shots by a kid half my age
7101872 i decided i need to find my new british bff london watch out im coming to town and bringing my fast paced life with me im in the uk all the time but of course i cant bring all my friends so ive decided to look for a new bff across the pond i need a best friend who is hot who can keep up with me and most of all who is real and wont be a backstabber im not leaving london until i find that amazing girl or guy who can meet the challenges
7101873 we get a laugh out of it shes really cool she just takes everything as it comes
7101874 she doesnt read about herself but i think people tell her and she gets a kick out of it shes very calm and very secure she knows people are always going to talk that stuff doesnt bother her
7101875 you cant say its the economy because there are shows like mamma mia that are selling out
7101876 its not that katies bad in the part shes good enough the producers are just getting the feeling people still want to view katie as her character sweet little joey potter
7101877 that information is totally false there is a healthy advance for the show and there is no chance of the run being shortened
7101878 its gonna be so great that it will be the final party after this one maybe he just wont be able to stage any more
7101879 if youre one of the tens of thousands of sag members who dont work enough or earn enough as an actor youre in danger of losing one of your fundamental rights as a union member
7101880 theyve proudly and publicly touted their list of supporters including the names of very high profile actor producers they and their supporters have signed a petition that would end democracy in the screen actors guild and create a class system between the haves and the have nots
7101881 she came to our office while we were shooting a campaign and she stopped by the shoot we shot a couple of different looks on her but she is not the new face of ed hardy or christian audigier and we are not doing a swimwear line with her
7101882 i got over the wanting to be cool thing a long time ago and found it quite liberating once you stop worrying about how you might be perceived even in character its strangely freeing
7101883 so ive actually gravitated towards doing things that are uncomfortable and embarrassing and i enjoy it
7101884 its her character im playing so we talked about it i asked are there any pippa tendencies you want to talk about
7101885 but she said what are you talking about i saw your reading and copied you
7101886 so i didnt have to worry about doing anything that robin was doing
7101887 was not a tax resident of any country and therefore the payment was free of tax
7101888 i havent even heard about it i dont ever pay attention to that stuff
7101889 shes one of my best friends in the whole wide world and honestly when youre sitting in a room for three hours doing satellite interviews
7101890 i could only drag my leg around the house something told me urgent action was required
7101891 i had micro surgery on friday morning this is the fifth time ive gone under the scalpel and each time i think its miraculous
7101892 i can now walk again slowly without the drag but its going to take at least six months of physiotherapy before i start to walk more normally again
7101893 he tracked me down in britain told me he was a huge fan and said he wanted me to be part of his creative life and now were doing night at the museum 2 together
7101894 doing tropic thunder was great fun but hes a very tough director when hes directing he can be a bit of a bastard but in the nicest possible way
7101895 there are obviously always little dramas you are on set for 16 hours so people get irritable in any workplace there are always little things and frustrations
7101896 leighton and blake could not be more different from each other but as far as i know there has never been any real difficulty we are all good friends and we go out socially together
7101897 i am not surprised by their reaction i think thats because they immediately thought i was there to undermine the franchise having had a background in comedy but thats not what its about at all
7101898 is not scheduled to be in the recording studio with britney
7101899 hitler knew she was jewish her real name was hedwig kiesler which was an obvious jewish name i think he overlooked this because he wanted to get all those munitions from her husband he also wanted to be with hedy she was beautiful
7101900 i havent seen the movie and i wont go see the movie because of what ive heard but i want to add my two cents to the opinions on whether its offensive to the mentally challenged
7101901 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers and college students will leave the theater thinking r ard is an okay word to use its not its taken years to get people to stop using that word
7101902 the doctors told me the bad news the sam we loved was gone they were keeping a fragile shell of her alive
7101903 it was the hardest most heartbreaking decision ive ever had to make to tell the doctors to let my beautiful sam slip away into her long sleep i wept like a child
7101904 i know hell look like his grandmother and that will probably break my sore heart all over again
7101905 melanie is over the moon at the prospect of becoming a mum for the first time
7101906 id really like to be a mum one day my mum looks forward to having grandchildren

7101908 when the stars were right they could plunge from the c amp w chart to the hot 100 but when the stars were wrong they would remain in their own genre subdomain but although they were no longer on top 40 radio they would never really pass from public consciousness

7101911 was accused of plagiarism when he did not credit neil kinnock then leader of the british labor party for much of his stump speech
7101912 john quinlan a reporter for the sioux city journal said his notes showed biden said he was quoting kinnock when he used the same passage in a speech aug 14 stories in the new york times the boston globe and other newspapers also said biden had used the rhetoric and credited kinnock for it

7101918 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university was it because our predecessors were thick was it because they were weak those people who could work eight hours underground as coal miners and come up and play football weak it was because there was no platform upon which they could stand

7101933 all i then knew about aleister crowley was vague and unfavourable he was said to be a satanist a black magician a sadist a nut a heroin addict and a sexual degenrate of monstrous proportions i had somehow or other also heard that croley had climbed higher on chogo ri than any other mountaineer in history and had set several other climbing records and that intrigued me few junkies have the stamina for such exertions and one wondered a bit if some of aleisters infamous reputation was exagerrated

7101989 while ofcom recognises that the programme concerned personal relationships the manner in which the presenter referred to his own business was overtly promotional and therefore lacked any editorial justification
7101990 blurred the boundaries between advertising and an editorially justified travel feature
7101991 it appeared to ofcom that the sponsor had been permitted to influence the travel features content on a regular basis
7101992 the broadcaster had ceased to take effective responsibility for its output and ceded editorial independence
7101993 this particular output highlighted a repeated compliance failure since the item was featured weekly ofcom is concerned that programming so clearly in breach of the code remained on air until we had alerted utv to this complaint
7101994 ofcom was therefore extremely concerned to note that listeners were still likely to be misled into potentially submitting text messages during pre recorded programmes without it being made clear whether any such texts were likely to be put to air

7102016 gday its mike smith again with another edition of indie film nation on todays program in a condensed format we chat to goetz weber the ceo of indplay which is a really handy site for filmmakers
7102017 gday everyone out there returning again with another edition of indie film nation
7102018 absolutely and mike thanks for the opportunity to chat about the company weve created a software environment that allows buyers and sellers of content to do deals and those buyers and sellers of content are typically from a sellers perspective people that have video rights such as the independents the independent video producers on the other side people that want video rights those are the so called buyers or licensees in the various channels that would be tv internet telcos the mobile players dvd markets etc another way of putting it its an online content marketplace and our aim is to create new efficiencies and to give independent content rights holders a broader exposure to the distribution market than they have today
7102019 ok and that being the brief summary how does it actually work for firstly the filmmaker what does someone actually do ive made a film ive played in a couple film festivals but the film wasnt picked up at the time how does indplay work for that kind of scenario
7102020 i still own the vod rights i still own tv rights in australia or i own dvd rights in south africa or i still own everything and then that data is published in a secure way to our distribution partners in other words it is made available to the internet tv mobile or dvd partners looking for fresh content and they then indirect the buyer can access these rights and do a deal with them for example a buyer in northern america in a local cable network here in australia to source their distribution exhibition rights to that specific movie for a specific deal they can propose an upfront payment for a six month deal a license deal or an ad supported revenue share deal there are different kinds of deals that can be made through our platform but basically what the platform does is create a level playing field for the content producers because now they can get access to all of these wonderful distributors out in the different markets it also makes life easy for the distributor thats looking for fresh content so that even though they may have gone to the film festival that the filmmaker was also at perhaps they didnt connect with the filmmaker or they didnt connect with the film markets so thats really the premise behind an online video rights market
7102021 on the other side of the coin and youve touched on that on the content provider side but obviously youd verify who is registering as the buyer but how does that work how do you verify what sort of process how in depth do you go to check out the background of someone registering as a buyer

7102099 if we do nothing more if theres no extra investment above what we have now we will go backwards
7102100 thats based on seeing the amount of money other countries are investing even if we put a bit more money in well only tread water
7102101 be rightly pleased they have got more than their moneys worth people should be blown away
7102102 our position is that we would review high performance sport in terms of our policy after the olympics we didnt think it was appropriate to have any discussion about it until after the beijing olympics but it is no great secret that both the academy and the nzoc have serious financial pressures and we intend to address those in the next few weeks
7102103 address the high performance end of sport some time soon
7102104 the strategy is right and we have lots of confidence we are doing the right thing
7102105 can we do better of course we can should we do better absolutely are there things to improve on absolutely but the buzz around here from other nations is that we have done brilliantly
7102106 the number of others bubbling up in fourth to eighth those who get diplomas is important that indicates depth and flow on and is critical

7102117 i come out and i want to dance you want to jump for joy because everything feels in line
7102118 just to keep that spine aligned keep it straight to make sure i am tip top
7102119 if we demand that from our standard medicine then we should demand it from the alternative lot as well
7102120 completely and utterly outside any kind of reality that we know of
7102121 over the last 10 or so years there has been increased investment and interest in undertaking clinical trials with herbal medicines so the evidence base is increasing
7102122 at the other extreme the archetypal new ager will tell you that all natural health products work all the time and are safe because they are natural
7102123 see it as the answer to a range of much less clearly defined conditions allergies anxiety back pain fatigue depression digestive problems food sensitivities headaches insomnia skin disorders stress and overweight
7102124 setting the theory aside if medicine works whether its a tea leaf boiled up or a drug thats taken a pharmaceutical company millions to develop if it actually works and the evidence shows it works then thats an effective medicine
7102125 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said

7102141 he has spent days in his room looking for just the right gift usually
7102142 when he gets a birthday invitation i ask andy what do you want me to buy for your friend he always shrugs and says i dont know but this time hes spending hours deciding on just the right thing
7102143 but i want you to have it chase i think youll really like it
7102144 aber umgekehrt h tte ich heute halt auch richtig boden gutmachen k nnen wenn es bei uns nicht passiert w re
7102145 ich hatte einen ganz guten start konnte auch gleich in der anfangsphase vor dem safety car drei leute berholen ohne mich selbst in schwierigkeiten zu bringen
7102146 das war ein bisschen bereifrig beim beschleunigen aber das passiert auf dieser strecke sehr schnell aber ich konnte das auto ja noch abfangen
7102147 ich muss da noch mal bei andy soucek vorbeigehen und mich entschuldigen das war keine absicht wir sind da alle ein bisschen im windschatten gefahren ich habe meinen bremspunkt etwas verpasst er wohl auch ein bisschen und dabei habe ich ihn erwischt
7102148 sonst h tte ich versucht noch ein bisschen langsamer zu fahren um zu sparen ich hatte ja einigen abstand zu den leuten hinter mir ich habe halt gehofft dann noch irgendwie ber die ziellinie zu kommen es war nur echt rgerlich dass mich filippi 20 meter vor der linie noch abgefangen hat sonst w re es zumindest der achte platz und damit morgen die pole position gewesen
7102149 aber f r unm glich halte ich es nicht das auto ist nicht schlecht wir werden jetzt noch ein paar kleine nderungen machen und ich habe ja heute schon gesehen dass man schon berholen kann
7102150 kan du gi meg en god grunn til ikke gi opp
7102151 da jeg plantet fr ene til bregnene og bambusen tok jeg godt vare p dem jeg ga dem lys og jeg ga dem vann bregnene vokste raskt og deres skinnende gr nne blader dekket marken bambus fr ene derimot ga ikke noe resultat men jeg ga ikke opp bambusen det andre ret vokste bregnene seg st rre og videre enn ret f r mens ingenting kom opp fra bambus fr ene jeg ga fortsatt ikke opp bambus fr ene
7102152 det tredje ret kom det fortsatt ingenting opp fra bambus fr ene men jeg ville ikke gi opp dem det fjerde ret ingenting fra bambus fr ene jeg ville ikke gi opp
7102153 s det femte ret kom det en liten spire opp av jorden fra bambus fr ene sammenlignet med bregnene var den ynkelig og nesten usynlig men etter bare 6 m neder var bambusen vokst til over 30 meters h yde den hadde brukt fem r p utvikle r tter disse gjorde den sterk og ga den det den trengte for overleve jeg ville aldri gi en av mine skapninger en utfordring som de ikke ville mestre
7102154 visste du at hele den tiden du har kjempet har du i virkeligheten utviklet r tter
7102155 jeg nektet gi ikke opp bambus fr ene jeg vil aldri gi opp deg
7102156 bambusen hadde en annen funksjon enn bregnen likevel gj r begge skogen vakker
7102157 gi meg re ved vokse s h yt du kan

7102164 im keeping this one hes amazing and sweet and gah i just love him so much
7102165 if i had the means right now id probably propose
7102166 i do not regard our national debt as unduly alarming
7102167 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
7102168 decides the outcome of a battle one hour the success of a campaign one day the fate of empires i operate not by hours but by minutes
7102169 at best battle held surprise and suvorovs inclination was to use surprise against the enemy while training his men to be proof against the unexpected
7102170 far from being the uncaring brute suvorov placed his emphasis on the ultimate concern getting his men through combat successfully
7102171 i cannot remember any player who has left arsenal and been a superstar you know it is difficult dont get me wrong alex hleb and mathieu flamini are probably two of my best friends in football i wish them all the best i speak to them every week
7102172 arsenal is arsenal and this club has something special that no others have we have to take care of it thats why you have to be intelligent in your decisions
7102173 i know what this clubs has i have spoken to a lot of players i have friends in spain in italy and they speak to me about other clubs and i know that im privileged to be where i am and i dont want to lose it
7102174 im still young i want to win things for the club i want to get experience and i want to compete because when you see football around the world you see very few teams that play the way that we play and i just enjoy the way we play
7102175 dr thaksin is embarrassed about the indignity brought on all the entities the club the premier league he never intended this
7102176 i think there is a very loose term about what is fit and proper it is almost a tongue in cheek term that you would use for premier league football over the last 10 years there are plenty of unfit and improper individuals
7102177 dr thaksin is in a political situation and a case that affects his assets so thats well documented so thats a hurdle
7102178 the truth of it is this club is not going to go out of business this club is not bankrupt were moving forward
7102179 he wants to be at this ground on sunday but he is hearing advice about being in a public space
7102180 there are about 11 days left so we are under pressure
7102181 were working at something you never know in football we may get him we may not
7102182 if we dont we will carry on with what weve got

7102187 hoho for i have stolen another 25 cents from someone on the internet my dastardly deeds know no bounds
7102188 answer applies here as well you will want to familiarize yourself with all the approaches and decide which one is best for your situation
7102189 yes i am finally going ahead with happy new year we have made some changes in the earlier script the truth is i wanted to make happy new year before om shanti om i plan to have an interesting cast along with shah rukh but i still havent decided how many of the actors will be established and how many will be newcomers
7102190 would i be comfortable saying this to the persons face
7102191 wow it took me until several minutes after i read the article to figure out that it was from the onion
7102192 there is no way those are what i think they are
7102193 someone died you dont say because i sure as hell feel just fine
7102194 the violin is for the beast that guards the sanctum beyond the gate
7102195 though i cant really remember his name i just know that you have to give him a coin or something so hell ferry you across
7102196 charon does require his pay yes we have to find you a suitable coin or three for your journey youre not alive and hell be loathe to let you pass but enough gold may persuade him
7102197 does he even has a use for the gold i mean its not like theres a gap or a hot topic or wherever it is that ancient gods and mythical figures of the underworld can shop at down there
7102198 its part of how and who he is when he was conceived of it was understood that he required payment and as such he still does there isnt much belief in him these days to be sure but those of us keep the old ways keep them and steadily so
7102199 these people gods mythical figures whatever you want to call them havent always been here on this green earth theres always been a sort of over arching energy the ether or the tao the flow whatever you want to call it or however you want to think of it and when humans came along and began to develop their own mythology belief systems all of that they pulled it from the flow it was almost as if human belief put the seed into the flow and the flow gave birth to the gods
7102200 so the gods energy has always been there waiting to be born
7102201 you could say that yes there was something of it there some aspect that could very easily be made into a god or a figure of mythology
7102202 people pass the myth along and thats a sort of belief in and of itself and there are those like me creatures of myth who dont need the myth creatures who werent called forth by tales but by whom tales were called forth who keep the old ways give small offerings to those as we are bound to
7102203 you sure as hell manage to confuse the piss out of me whenever youre trying to teach me a lesson
7102204 think of it this way persephone the energy from which gods are drawn is like water the paradigm you put the gods into the mythology the way in which you believe and the way you feel the gods are and act is a jar you pour the energy into the jar and you have a god a being of energy but one that conforms to the jar thus they act as they were first envisioned because how can water change the jar in which it is kept and belief maintains those jars keeps them from bursting and letting the water all drain away
7102205 gone and faded from memory my own and all mortals
7102206 can you believe in something which is dead strong enough to call it back from the flow strong enough to feed it and if you can would you truly want to would you want to call so hungry an entity back with the sole power of yourself and your belief
7102207 is a history shrouded in much mystery and controversy all of the first vampires have died and after a couple thousand years stories get mucked up and twisted youve the bible for proof of that we can all agree on gods and their myths if only because the gods dont like to be changed at the whim of a few thousand vampires but anything else is anyones game
7102208 theres a theory though if youve ever read the odyssey the first region of hades the fields of asphodel have those long dead heroes the ghosts wander despondent and intangible and can only be brought back to some semblance of humanity by offerings of blood and sacrifices and the like some people think that the first vampires were heroes who were offered blood and fled from hell though i wouldnt know how to propagate above ground pluto alone knows how true that tale is though all thats known is that once all vampires relied on blood and slowly we came to realize that energy was just as good some still prefer blood of course or supplement their diet with it but thats little more than personal taste preference
7102209 this tends to work better if youre on the other end trying to get it lit
7102210 if there are plenty of gods in the world how can i go to hades to get jason back why cant i go to heaven or hell or the happy fields or something
7102211 right now for most of these games when the player saves the princess and he starts walking away from the tower if he looks back hes going to see the princess at the top of the tower again
7102212 if you save the village it stays saved you saved it but maybe now that village becomes an objective for another player maybe something has to be done now because that village wasnt destroyed and so on and so on and so on building those mechanisms to make it a world that reacts to a players actions instead of existing in a static state thats the world were talking about

7102221 i went to the woods because i wished to live deliberately to front only the essential facts of life and see if i could not learn what it had to teach and not when i came to die discover that i had not lived
7102222 when i bought the first one my husband who is not a beach person said oh this is such a waste of money the kids will never go
7102223 then it got to the point where they used it so much i couldnt get in the place so i bought another one
7102224 im one of the people who should not be homeless
7102225 theres two sets of odds that make this discovery really way out first of all its unlikely that something this fragile could survive buried in a bog at all and then for it to be unearthed and spotted before it was destroyed is incalculably more amazing

7102236 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to
7102237 if one looks at the credentials of skeptics compared to the credentials of defenders of the official line it is impossible to dismiss skeptics as kooks
7102238 altemeyer prepared a digest of his research for general readers which he has posted online for one and all to examine at no cost
7102239 we believe in liberty and justice for all so of course we oppose many us government policies it means we believe in freedom as more than merely a cliche
7102240 if president morales does not lead the new dialogue in a manner that defuses tensions and achieves consensus he risks new violence and ultimately the failure of his project of near revolutionary change
7102241 morales must now lead negotiations among all political forces aimed at committing ca delegates to produce a constitutional text or texts by that date that can be presented to referendum reject violence and find a mechanism to incorporate compatibly the two sides differing notions of autonomy
7102242 the rural urban divide as well as the east west geographic divide has been deepening
7102243 if violent confrontation is to be avoided all political actors need to recall that the election of morales was a vote for change and make efforts to find consensus on the nature limits and timing of those changes

7102249 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7102250 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7102251 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case

7102312 divers are personally invested in the oceans and truly understand the importance of safeguarding marine wildlife and habitats
7102313 divers are avid participants in ecotourism and show a great willingness to protect all that inhabits the oceans
7102314 divers are great advocates for the oceans because they see first hand whats happening in the water

7102317 the research outlines the sometimes forgotten nautical history of long island the book dives into the history of 11 different shipwrecks starting with the loss of the savannah the first vessel to utilize steam power for transatlantic travel to the terrible loss of life aboard the tug boat gwendoline steers in the early 1960s throughout the research i was reminded of the one theme that sadly remained constant all were claimed most under terrible conditions in situations that pit man versus the enormity of the sea
7102318 the joy of the project stemmed from the ability to work with other divers
7102319 i had the unique opportunity to work with several historical research centers both locally and globally and dive groups as i dove into the past divers from the long island divers association wrecksploration and seascapes usa dive shop including larry gerber mark silverstein john bricker bob auteri harold and doug acker adam altman william pfeiffer and tony bliss opened their dive logs to help me tell the stories of these wrecks that rest on the bottom of our waters the end result is an interesting look at history it is truly a hands on and on the bottom approach to our past
7102320 although the news isnt all good this report provides us with an important benchmark
7102321 the data in the report will serve as a baseline that sanctuary staff can use to measure future changes in grays reefs extraordinarily valuable and productive marine ecosystem
7102322 the bottom line is that airgun noise from seismic surveys that are thousands of yards distant does not drive away sperm whales living in the gulf
7102323 however some individual whales feeding at depth reduced the rate at which they searched acoustically for their prey when scientists carried out controlled exposure experiments by bringing seismic surveys close by the whales as a result the oil and gas industry has agreed to a best practice attitude that seismic surveys should shut down temporarily when towed airguns come within one third of a mile of whales or groups of whales in the gulf
7102324 sperm whales go to where their food source is and that means very deep water so folks that do see them are marine mammal observers who ride the seismic survey vessels and the workers on the big oil and gas rigs and even that does not happen often
7102325 we now know that the sperm whales in the gulf appear to be their own distinct stock they show genetic and social differences from other sperm whales around the world
7102326 there are believed to be about 500 to 1 500 sperm whales that reside in the gulf
7102327 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus

7102350 i wish hed save nuance and sanctimony for senior seminars give america some straight answers crack some jokes at his own high horse expense convince me hes up to this thats what mccains done lately its working
7102351 better for mr obama to swallow his instincts and model himself on george w bush whose constant repetition of simple themes short on artistry and sometimes even grammar broke through to the average voter
7102352 george w announced his candidacy with a list of four or five promises of what he would do as president
7102353 eighteen months later he was still repeating the same list in the same words
7102354 we are the ones the ones we have been waiting for
7102355 there is demand for google search despite what the carriers put in front of them
7102356 obamas in much better shape because he seems to have very good standing in the places that john kerry won and very good opportunities in a number of other states that look like they could go to the democrats
7102357 mccains fundamental problem is theres only one way home for him replicate the bush electoral victory state by state
7102358 the fundamental truth remains that this race is extremely tight mccain is in strong position in ohio and florida two states that have been critical for republican victories and hes better positioned today in michigan than the president was in either 2000 or 2004

7102390 it has been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7102391 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and we beat australia
7102392 we tried hard to get there but thats the way it goes
7102393 and thats what hurts the most id rather lose by 20 than two but its still disappointing
7102394 defense has been our strength the whole tournament and we just let them have 90 points thats not australian basketball
7102395 this is my last olympic games i want to thank many people including those who doubted me and those who supported me

7102399 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7102400 russias state controlled media seemed extremely well prepared to cover the outbreak of armed conflict in georgia television networks immediately presented elaborate graphics with news anchors and commentators appearing to stick to disciplined talking points accusing georgian president mikheil saakashvili of aggression and the georgian armed forces of genocide and ethnic cleansing
7102401 at the hotel we discovered that there were already 48 russian journalists there together with us there were 50 people
7102402 i was the only one representing a foreign news agency the rest were from russian media and they arrived three days before we did as if they knew that something was going to happen earlier at the border crossing we met one man who was taking his wife and children from tskhinvali
7102403 we played hard and we never gave up only in the second set we played badly
7102404 i am not too emotional personally the team has improved every day especially the young players
7102405 i am very lucky to have this crowd support the people here have given us a lot of care and love especially off the court
7102406 the gold medal match is always bitter sweet for the loser but what weve got to look at is that we got a silver medal
7102407 nobody expected it but we knew deep down inside that we were that good we came out to this tournament and fought our hearts out
7102408 we came to play the number one team in the world we got a game set off them and we could have taken them to five thats all we could ask for we are just thrilled

7102418 it is harsh to lose the game but it is fair to say fulham played well

7102422 the irony is the only people mccain can count on to vote for him are the very republicans he despises at least those of us who can get drunk enough on election day to pull the lever for him
7102423 the thought of mccain being president sends a cold chill down my spine he is erratic he is hotheaded he loses his temper and he worries me
7102424 senator mccain is noted for three major pieces of legislation i think all of them were badly flawed and evidence a lack of understanding of our economy the very lack of understanding which senator mccain has admitted on numerous occasions
7102425 this is a great day for the voters of the town of lyme and others that see the need for more clean energy such as wind power in todays world of increasing energy demands

7102501 so ist es eben bei einem stadtkurs die kleinste unachtsamkeit und es kann vorbei sein

7102507 if you really want to break the habit and risk being called an ungrateful dick by every dude you know then you could try not having sex i heard abstinence makes the heart grow fonder or something like that so weaning yourself off of spanking and reintroducing sex without it might work best of luck to you though its not going to be easy with a hot sexually adventurous woman around you at all times and once you stop satisfying her intimate needs she may very well just pick up her paddle and move on to the next man willing to fulfill her fantasy unfortunately for you thats pretty much all of them

7102533 life is a battle in which we fall from wounds we receive in running away
7102534 there are moments in life where the heart takes a bruising especially in the areas of relationships these experiences have the ability to propel an individual into an evolvement stage or into a negative spiral which attracts more drama and more bruising
7102535 how could this happen i trusted this person with everything and gave them everything
7102536 ive got my bong award on my fireplace its the only award ive ever won im so proud
7102537 this is a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympic games the sanctions are the following and are effective immediately lifetime ban of the coach and athlete in all championships sanctioned by the world taekwondo federation and at the same time all records of this athlete at the beijing games will immediately be erased

7102542 so shall you earn a kings sword who cast your sword away
7102543 i thought it was fascinating because as far as celebrity culture went it was actually a modern phenomenon
7102544 there would literally be riots when she turned up at political rallies people following her everywhere trying to draw really quickly what she was wearing and obviously all the whig papers were hugely supportive and the other papers were calling her a whore
7102545 and the whole concept of a fashion icon i didnt realise that that was back then too this way that we have of picking women apart and analysing everything about them
7102546 yeah which men have never had i find it quite interesting that we still do exactly the same thing to women as they were doing back in 1790
7102547 obviously weve moved on but the fact that you can find any similarity is quite weird
7102548 he just completely gets inside the heads of characters and its really grimy
7102549 writes amazing dialogue and you very rarely get really good dialogue in films the rhythms and everything were beautiful she was so f ing clever
7102550 we didnt have the rights to the dylan thomas poems so she took his verse and reflected it few people have actually picked up on that
7102551 it was fantastic to work on something that weve had so many conversations about i wasnt that convinced that it was actually ever going to be made
7102552 its very difficult to get those kind of films made
7102553 honestly i dont know very much about the whole lady di thing
7102554 i dont know you look at the contemporary films that i have had success with and its been love actually and bend it like beckham
7102555 ive just been offered more interesting characters in period films for some reason than ive found in contemporary films
7102556 i personally love watching period pieces you can completely dive into another reality if youre doing one set 300 years ago you can let your imagination go wild i think i find it more freeing to work in period
7102557 not saying that im never going to do something thats completely overtly flamboyant
7102558 oh thatd be great but at the moment i am completely fascinated by the minutiae of emotion as opposed to the big gesture and possibly being british im fascinated with repression emotional repression i f ing love that shit
7102559 again its the contradictions of what youre actually feeling inside and what you present on the front i find it fascinating to look into
7102560 i think ive got at least a sense of humour about it
7102561 it did actually make me die laughing i have a picture of me next to the poster trying desperately to get as much as cleavage as that you know you sign on to do certain kinds of films and you kind of expect that from a big old hollywood blockbuster and no there wasnt anything i could have done about it would i have preferred to say do you mind not giving me double d yes the original poster actually that came back was incredible like droopy tits like enhance them but dont give me your grandmothers tits at least give me pert tits for f sake
7102562 i did at least get some pert tits that werent mine but it doesnt really matter does it
7102563 im not a particularly litigious person i dont have the money to be suing national newspapers
7102564 but i think there are lines that certainly shouldnt be crossed and you have to be clear where those lines are that story was just horrible and if youre saying that i have a mental illness then im obviously not equipped to work so it would have people insurance companies whoever thinking twice about hiring me so its also really trying to f up any kind of career that i have so you have to take that seriously
7102565 it does come back to the original point with the duchess about how we take womens bodies apart yeah i find it fascinating
7102566 i didnt expect her to be so cool and so professional and so experienced
7102567 but when you go back to this incredible need for attention there was a part of it that was hugely enjoyed i think that thats what was always going to happen with her she was put into that society she very definitely made it a million times bigger when she married the most powerful man in england and then became a political hostess but she did that because she needed it
7102568 yeah and i took it as being a very sad reason a very lonely reason on the inside
7102569 i hate that its incredible that its allowed to happen im not going to get i could so easily rant
7102570 when youre talking about cars going very fast and kids possibly stepping out in front of them i think something should be done having been in several chases like that somebodys going to get very hurt very soon
7102571 see you might win some but you just lost one

7102578 four score and seven years ago or maybe it was a little longer ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men women and illegal aliens are created equal in fact some are more equal than those that were born on these lands thanks to our democrat party now we are engaged in a great iraqi war testing whether our nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated in a terrible history of racism sexism and mindless nationalism can long endure we are met on a great battlefield of that war with the troops of al qaeda and the taliban and even the superior fighting force of iran and syria we have come to dedicate a portion of this field so that my friend barack obama can ascend to the greatest job in the land the greatest job any foreign born person can aspire to the american presidency but in a larger sense we cannot dedicate we cannot consecrate we cannot hallow this ground until the messiah barack obama has walked upon this soil the brave man the messiah barack obama brings hope to the living and resurrection to the dead and money to the poor it is for us those living in the time of barack obama to be dedicated here to finishing the unfinished work which is his coronation as president it is for us to be here dedicated to this great task remaining before us that from these honored fallen candidates such as hillary edwards and others we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we here highly resolve that these candidates shall not have fallen in vain that this nation under god if there is one shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth as long as the flag of the united nations flies supreme

7102795 we wouldnt send the guy down if he was hurt obviously
7102796 were in a pennant race here so its hard to just work on those things and keep running him out there

7102805 there certainly were a lot of things talked about and it was all very important to me as long as rutgers and the state of new jersey are committed to being the best were going to grow responsibly i think thats what weve done
7102806 could i have had it if i wanted yes but im part of something bigger than just football im part of rutgers university
7102807 i felt the commitment was there i dont want to do things that way when youre part of something there has to be trust
7102808 ive been at a few places and theres always some dissent its not just at rutgers

7102824 ive had players with similar injuries respond quickly and its my hope that scott can respond quickly in this instance
7102825 we wish him a speedy recovery but we are lucky to have capable depth behind him to pick up the production in his absence
7102826 its just so unfortunate because the guy hasnt had a chance because of all the variety of injuries
7102827 the plan right now is that hell have the surgery well see how the rehab goes and then well deal with it then

7102981 no quieren decirnos a los padres qu es lo que pasa
7102982 me pareci que lo que dec a era similar a lo que le pasaba a mi hijo entonces me acerqu a la instituci n y me contact con la cuidadora de uno de los chicos con autismo mat as le dije miralo a mi hijo y fijate si lo que tiene es similar a lo que le pasa al ni o que cuid s me dijo que s trat de contenerme me invit a acercarme a la organizaci n y a otros pap s cuyos hijos sufren de la misma patolog a as fue que a trav s de ellos descubr que valent n ten a lo que ning n m dico me hab a dicho hasta ese momento que ten a trastorno general de desarrollo tgd que pod a ser autismo o el s ndrome de asperger
7102983 los padres se junten con otros padres y se ayuden entre s
7102984 el sue o es grande pero confiamos que con esfuerzo y compromiso podremos lograrlo
7102985 estos chicos necesitan mucha rutina la agenda es muy repetitiva porque ellos llevan los cambios muy mal
7102986 si est s motivado y te gusta cualquier dificultad es f cil de sobrellevar esta es una labor que te llena de satisfacci n
7102987 es un respiro familiar para que los padres tengan la oportunidad de desconectar un poco del cuidado de estos chicos
7102988 los monitores son una ayuda permanente para los ni os les acompa an en todas las actividades de la agenda y procuran que est n lo mejor posible
7102989 es una experiencia muy bonita normalmente en cada nueva edici n repiten tanto los ni os como los monitores voluntarios lo pasamos muy bien
7102990 cualquier padre con un hijo con capacidades diferentes sabe que es un inconveniente para la familia sea cual fuera la discapacidad un chico con s ndrome de down un autista como en nuestro caso o con cualquier otra discapacidad un trastorno para la familia uno tiene la vida organizada pero cuando se entera que tiene un hijo con capacidades diferentes sabe que tiene que tomar otro rumbo buscar ayuda a trav s de escuelas especiales para integrarlo a la sociedad
7102991 uno fue educado para tener en cuenta las etapas evolutivas para jugar a la pelota con su hijo a cierta edad ver que ste se emancipa pero esa ense anza est pensada para relacionarnos con las personas que no tienen ning n tipo de discapacidad
7102992 en ese sentido cuando nace tu hijo diferente lo primero que siente es angustia pero la resultante es que nos debemos al chico y no podemos no hacernos cargo por el contrario debemos saber que ellos depender n de nosotros toda su vida sab amos que las angustias las tristezas las l grimas que derramamos en la madrugada para que los otros hijos no te vean los berrinches el despertarte y ver la casa en un caos no sirve de nada por el contrario ten s que aceptar la idea y entender que una familia con una persona discapacitada sigue siendo una familia y que adem s no hay una familia ideal se te derrumba todo al principio pero despu s la esperanza renace porque vos lo am s si bien los autistas no se conectan como nosotros hay miradas hay cuestiones que nos piden se comunican a su manera manifiestan y reciben afecto
7102993 porque si har amos lo que primero te nace cuando no ten s respuesta para el problema sacarlo del contexto familiar les har amos un gran da o ellos nacieron as tenemos que integrarlos y convivir con eso
7102994 era un beb a pedir de boca los amigos que iban a casa dec an que suerte ten amos porque no ten a berrinches dorm a y com a dijo algunas palabras pero despu s ya no lo hizo m s despu s no nos mir y cada vez lo ve amos m s distantes eso fue lo m s triste
7102995 no nos quedamos con esa respuesta y consultamos a una neur loga mi esposa que es profesora en psicolog a le explic a la profesional lo que ella observaba la neur loga lo vio le hizo un test y l hizo las manifestaciones completas ah nos pidi que nos sent ramos y nos dijo que nuestro hijo ten a trastornos generalizados del desarrollo tgd cuando te dicen el diagn stico no sab s para que lado salir le preguntamos si se curaba y nos dijo que no nos transmiti que tampoco se compra nada para curarlo pero nos dio sugerencias de medicamentos y terapia la m dica nos dijo que no nos pod a asegurar lo que iba a ser facundo pero nos transmiti que s nos pod a decir lo que l ser a si no ten a el tratamiento un nene sin tratamiento est condenado a explotar lo m ximo de la vida an rquica
7102996 lo primero es la angustia de no poder comunicarte de no entenderlo y esto genera un caos en las familias que tambi n se le transmite al chico
7102997 los padres se junten con otros padres y se ayuden entre s
7102998 pablo acosta y facundo santana van a escuelas comunes con una auxiliar docente
7102999 durante el d a cuando sus padres no est n hay casos que se ha logrado la cobertura por parte del iosper de la figura de guarda y acompa ante permanente una persona que es como la sombra del ni o
7103000 las personas con capacidades diferentes nos marcan c mo deber a ser la vida real c mo deber a ser este mundo la persona con capacidades diferentes valora una cantidad de cosas que nosotros dejamos pasar por alto a lo largo de la vida
7103001 por eso pedimos la urgente adhesi n a la ley nacional de discapacidad si esto se diera todo ser a m s f cil pero a pesar de los reclamos no lo hemos podido lograr sabemos que en la actualidad hay dos nuevas iniciativas una en el senado y otra en diputados la de la c mara baja que se nos present es abarcativa y superadora de la adhesi n pero hasta ahora es simplemente una expresi n de deseo por eso estamos muy preocupados respecto que su tratamiento se extienda tanto en el tiempo una muestra de sensibilidad por parte de nuestros legisladores simplemente queremos decirles que las personas con discapacidad tambi n gozan de los derechos humanos consagrados constitucionalmente
7103002 el sue o es grande pero confiamos que con esfuerzo y compromiso podremos lograrlo
7103003 hemos tenido buenas voluntades pero con eso no alcanza en realidad no hay una pol tica clara con presupuesto y personas dispuestas para llevarla adelante el gobierno provincial no la tuvo nunca y ni siquiera ha estado en su agenda
7103004 en entre r os hay dos proyectos uno del diputado jorge kerz y otro del senador garbelino pero a pesar de la movida y del aparente inter s hasta ahora no se logr avanzar en nada
7103005 se aprueban cosas que nos tiran atr s aunque hay gestos de docentes que a n en las condiciones en que est n las escuelas en este momento con poco personal y carencia de recursos materiales integran a nuestros chicos pero ah viene el problema se pide al consejo de educaci n un auxiliar para que el chico se integre y contestan que no est en la grilla de presupuesto o simplemente no responden
7103006 el chico pierde la interacci n que es necesaria para su integraci n
7103007 fallan reas especificas del consejo general de educaci n cge como las direcciones de educaci n especial o de inicial simplemente no les interesa
7103008 los grandes beneficios que trae asistir a una escuela com n a un chico con trastornos del desarrollo dentro del espectro autista no solo para l mismo sino para su familia se ven limitados por la falta de pol ticas del el estado hay cosas que ellos s lo las aprenden en contacto con otros ni os que padecen el mismo trastorno pueden tener 10 15 o 20 horas de terapia en su casa pero lo que les ense a el compartir nicamente lo aprenden con sus pares y de una manera tan natural que es para toda la vida lo que necesita una persona con autismo es que otro le ense e por eso es maravilloso lo que se puede hacer en una escuela com n lamentablemente en entre r os no se dan las condiciones
7103009 que gentilmente ofreci sus instalaciones para que nuestros ni os se encuentren
7103010 nos ofreci llevarlos a pasear en un minib s en el que haremos un recorrido por distintos lugares de la ciudad donde se interpreten las rutinas de nuestros hijos luego esperaremos a los dem s integrantes de la familia en la placita que est ubicada en calle mitre cerca de la direcci n de educaci n municipal
7103011 el proyecto fue enviado por el departamento ejecutivo municipal dem y algo se movi ya que ahora est en la comisi n de legislaci n del concejo deliberante

7103027 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7103028 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7103029 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves

7103061 the indian art market is becoming global and indian artists are now featuring in international auctions quality indian art has an important edge over international art
7103062 some time ago i was speaking to a billionaire from italy who found an indian artist featured in one of the catalogues of a global auction
7103063 he said indian art was so inexpensive if he had to purchase similar work by an american artist he would have to purchase it for 1 million whereas he would be able to buy similar quality art for 50 000 from an indian artist
7103064 the economy has changed anyone can buy indian art be it a sheikh from dubai or collector from hong kong one does not go to the west to validate it
7103065 those were the times when our country was battling several issues and there was no one to validate art but not any more
7103066 there is virtually no carryover of the existing indica in the new indica
7103067 it will certainly be a step up from the existing indica
7103068 the investment is for both this product and what we are doing in ranjangaon for fiat
7103069 we were not satisfied with the product when we arent quite certain that we are launching a fine product we would rather delay it
7103070 we wanted to fine tune the way it drives there were some small points that discerning customers will notice we were giving attention to those attributes regarding its fit and finish
7103071 we would be hesitant to open multiple markets at a time we will be ready for exports in six months time
7103072 i am not diffident about the fact that it is one of the most loved cab cars why the commercial segment prefers indica is because it is the most economical car to own and maintain no other car has a diesel offering at that price
7103073 what we would not want is the car to be preferred by the commercial segment alone
7103074 we wanted the selection panel to be completely transparent and unbiased

7103110 entertainment is not revival although that is an obvious statement it is sadly not always understood too often it is assumed that an atmosphere of revival can be achieved by using music lighting and techno media presentation highly organized events with attractive multi coloured brochures can generate excitement and draw huge crowds but it is misleading to think that having a good time equates to spiritual revival it is very easy to be negative about such displays but the problem remains that we lack spiritual vitality and life and we are often boringly out of touch and tradition or else events like that would not seem so attractive to young people the sad fact is that we have an idea in our heads of something far better but in our hearts and experience too often there is not much that is better

7103140 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket
7103141 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7103142 sen obamas choice in a running mate once again brings up his questionable judgment when faced with making major decisions
7103143 sen biden has long been a leading critic of sen obamas lack of foreign policy experience hes criticized sen obama for his lack of leadership and judgment on iraq afghanistan and his commitment to meet unconditionally with the leaders of rogue states
7103144 obamas decision clearly showcases that obama is aware that he lacks the experience if you will and the judgment in foreign policy arenas
7103145 twenty years of experience that has not been very solid in terms of projecting what was going to happen just doesnt make you a better commander in chief
7103146 we dont need as a commander in chief a war hero johns a war hero we need someone with some wisdom
7103147 youre getting national security experience youre getting enthusiasm and you hope youre getting some help in those white working class blue collar towns where barack obama needs help
7103148 the rap on him is that he talks too long his speeches dont end and occasionally he goes off the reservation
7103149 has a personal story as well triumph over tragedy he brings depth to this ticket
7103150 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook
7103151 an editorial in the los angeles times said in addition to his uncontrolled verbosity biden is a gaffe machine can you reassure voters in this country that you would have the discipline you would need on the world stage senator
7103152 biden can help a lot by first reassuring and even more important putting bush and mccain on trial and showing that barack obama is change thats what i think well see joe biden doing over the next couple of months

7103156 ik vond mezelf dun maar dat kwam omdat ik nooit een fatsoenlijke maaltijd kreeg tijdens modeshows of in het vliegtuig ik moest overnachten in goedkope hotels waar ze nog nooit van roomservice hadden gehoord
7103157 ik heb jarenlang slecht gegeten maar dat is niet mijn schuld het eten op de set was negen van de tien keer afschuwelijk ik kreeg het niet eens weg

7103184 we have to allow the personality of youth to express itself
7103185 he should show more respect for his competitors and shake hands give a tap on the shoulder to the other ones immediately after the finish and not make gestures like the one he made
7103186 i talked to the other guys and most of them are ok with it

7103240 la verdad que me parece muy triste porque ese se or el juez no sabe c mo me cuesta a m ganar ese dinero mis hijos lo que quieran lo que yo les pueda dar a ellos con mucho gusto pero la cantidad que le quieren dar a ella es una injusticia
7103241 es que est n viendo mucha televisi n y est n leyendo los escritos de far ndula en los peri dicos y revistas en esos medios que s lo hablan de la vida ntima de las personas y no la parte buena de la carrera de los artistas
7103242 ahora dicen pobre meli pobre las tarlipes me hubiesen preparado psicol gicamente para lo que me esperaba vivir
7103243 pagu los platos rotos de todo sin que se fijaran en c mo me iba a afectar esto a m
7103244 esto es una mala prensa que no busqu que me vino de robote y realmente la pas muy mal entre todo este l o choqu estuve dos d as sin salir de mi casa ahora me estoy recuperando pero me hizo vivir uno de los peores momentos de mi vida
7103245 hicimos una especie de compromiso y la relaci n se tom bastante seria desde un principio por parte de los dos
7103246 cualquier padre con un hijo con capacidades diferentes sabe que es un inconveniente para la familia sea cual fuera la discapacidad un chico con s ndrome de down un autista como en nuestro caso o con cualquier otra discapacidad un trastorno para la familia uno tiene la vida organizada pero cuando se entera que tiene un hijo con capacidades diferentes sabe que tiene que tomar otro rumbo buscar ayuda a trav s de escuelas especiales para integrarlo a la sociedad
7103247 uno fue educado para tener en cuenta las etapas evolutivas para jugar a la pelota con su hijo a cierta edad ver que ste se emancipa pero esa ense anza est pensada para relacionarnos con las personas que no tienen ning n tipo de discapacidad
7103248 en ese sentido cuando nace tu hijo diferente lo primero que siente es angustia pero la resultante es que nos debemos al chico y no podemos no hacernos cargo por el contrario debemos saber que ellos depender n de nosotros toda su vida sab amos que las angustias las tristezas las l grimas que derramamos en la madrugada para que los otros hijos no te vean los berrinches el despertarte y ver la casa en un caos no sirve de nada por el contrario ten s que aceptar la idea y entender que una familia con una persona discapacitada sigue siendo una familia y que adem s no hay una familia ideal se te derrumba todo al principio pero despu s la esperanza renace porque vos lo am s si bien los autistas no se conectan como nosotros hay miradas hay cuestiones que nos piden se comunican a su manera manifiestan y reciben afecto
7103249 porque si har amos lo que primero te nace cuando no ten s respuesta para el problema sacarlo del contexto familiar les har amos un gran da o ellos nacieron as tenemos que integrarlos y convivir con eso
7103250 era un beb a pedir de boca los amigos que iban a casa dec an que suerte ten amos porque no ten a berrinches dorm a y com a dijo algunas palabras pero despu s ya no lo hizo m s despu s no nos mir y cada vez lo ve amos m s distantes eso fue lo m s triste
7103251 no nos quedamos con esa respuesta y consultamos a una neur loga mi esposa que es profesora en psicolog a le explic a la profesional lo que ella observaba la neur loga lo vio le hizo un test y l hizo las manifestaciones completas ah nos pidi que nos sent ramos y nos dijo que nuestro hijo ten a trastornos generalizados del desarrollo tgd cuando te dicen el diagn stico no sab s para que lado salir le preguntamos si se curaba y nos dijo que no nos transmiti que tampoco se compra nada para curarlo pero nos dio sugerencias de medicamentos y terapia la m dica nos dijo que no nos pod a asegurar lo que iba a ser facundo pero nos transmiti que s nos pod a decir lo que l ser a si no ten a el tratamiento un nene sin tratamiento est condenado a explotar lo m ximo de la vida an rquica
7103252 lo primero es la angustia de no poder comunicarte de no entenderlo y esto genera un caos en las familias que tambi n se le transmite al chico
7103253 los padres se junten con otros padres y se ayuden entre s
7103254 pablo acosta y facundo santana van a escuelas comunes con una auxiliar docente
7103255 durante el d a cuando sus padres no est n hay casos que se ha logrado la cobertura por parte del iosper de la figura de guarda y acompa ante permanente una persona que es como la sombra del ni o
7103256 las personas con capacidades diferentes nos marcan c mo deber a ser la vida real c mo deber a ser este mundo la persona con capacidades diferentes valora una cantidad de cosas que nosotros dejamos pasar por alto a lo largo de la vida
7103257 por eso pedimos la urgente adhesi n a la ley nacional de discapacidad si esto se diera todo ser a m s f cil pero a pesar de los reclamos no lo hemos podido lograr sabemos que en la actualidad hay dos nuevas iniciativas una en el senado y otra en diputados la de la c mara baja que se nos present es abarcativa y superadora de la adhesi n pero hasta ahora es simplemente una expresi n de deseo por eso estamos muy preocupados respecto que su tratamiento se extienda tanto en el tiempo una muestra de sensibilidad por parte de nuestros legisladores simplemente queremos decirles que las personas con discapacidad tambi n gozan de los derechos humanos consagrados constitucionalmente
7103258 el sue o es grande pero confiamos que con esfuerzo y compromiso podremos lograrlo
7103259 hemos tenido buenas voluntades pero con eso no alcanza en realidad no hay una pol tica clara con presupuesto y personas dispuestas para llevarla adelante el gobierno provincial no la tuvo nunca y ni siquiera ha estado en su agenda
7103260 en entre r os hay dos proyectos uno del diputado jorge kerz y otro del senador garbelino pero a pesar de la movida y del aparente inter s hasta ahora no se logr avanzar en nada
7103261 se aprueban cosas que nos tiran atr s aunque hay gestos de docentes que a n en las condiciones en que est n las escuelas en este momento con poco personal y carencia de recursos materiales integran a nuestros chicos pero ah viene el problema se pide al consejo de educaci n un auxiliar para que el chico se integre y contestan que no est en la grilla de presupuesto o simplemente no responden
7103262 el chico pierde la interacci n que es necesaria para su integraci n
7103263 fallan reas especificas del consejo general de educaci n cge como las direcciones de educaci n especial o de inicial simplemente no les interesa
7103264 los grandes beneficios que trae asistir a una escuela com n a un chico con trastornos del desarrollo dentro del espectro autista no solo para l mismo sino para su familia se ven limitados por la falta de pol ticas del el estado hay cosas que ellos s lo las aprenden en contacto con otros ni os que padecen el mismo trastorno pueden tener 10 15 o 20 horas de terapia en su casa pero lo que les ense a el compartir nicamente lo aprenden con sus pares y de una manera tan natural que es para toda la vida lo que necesita una persona con autismo es que otro le ense e por eso es maravilloso lo que se puede hacer en una escuela com n lamentablemente en entre r os no se dan las condiciones
7103265 que gentilmente ofreci sus instalaciones para que nuestros ni os se encuentren
7103266 nos ofreci llevarlos a pasear en un minib s en el que haremos un recorrido por distintos lugares de la ciudad donde se interpreten las rutinas de nuestros hijos luego esperaremos a los dem s integrantes de la familia en la placita que est ubicada en calle mitre cerca de la direcci n de educaci n municipal

7103286 want to know what sports blogging can look like when its in the hands of a real journalist
7103287 well have to gain trust over a period of time and thats what were going to try to do
7103288 the killing sprees that seem to be enjoyed by the winnipeg police service
7103289 when theres comments that we enjoy a killing spree that to me is very disappointing
7103290 i think the majority of the public supports the police
7103291 a strong violation of the spirit of taekwondo and the olympics
7103292 suppose i never ever met you suppose we never fell in love suppose i never ever let you kiss me so sweet and so soft
7103293 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7103294 a man with a distinguished record a man with fundamental decency and that man is joe biden
7103295 the campaign of republican senator john mccain has been very critical of barack obama pointing to a lack of experience they characterise him as a lightweight someone who hasnt been steeped in policy issues who doesnt have a great breadth of experience especially in foreign policy
7103296 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7103297 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgement and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realising that barack obama is not ready to be president
7103298 i want somebody who is going to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policy making
7103299 there is a lot of electricity there even though everybody will dice it up and think about which constituencies are going to be more likely to vote for the ticket now at the end of the day it is about the chemistry between these two folks
7103300 when you add biden to it you add a populism to the ticket that may not have existed before in addition to all the credibility that comes with his experience
7103301 que meios tem atualmente o ex rcito georgiano para resistir a nova ofensiva russa especialmente agora ap s os russos terem passado boa parte desta semana a dinamitarem navios de guerra avi es e blindados capturados neste conflito e sobretudo depois de todas as perdas sofridas pelos georgianos neste conflito a ge rgia n o ter nos pr ximos 10 ou 15 anos meios suficientes para alinhar um qualquer tipo de resposta minimamente cred vel a qualquer ataque russo e sendo assim ser totalmente dependente de meios externos da nato para se defender isso que queremos um membro pleno indefeso que depende totalmente dos meios da alian a que como pode a ge rgia cumprir com o artigo 3 do tratado artigo 3 a fim de atingir mais eficazmente os fins deste tratado as partes tanto individualmente como em conjunto manter o e desenvolver o de maneira cont nua e efectiva pelos seus pr prios meios e mediante m tuo aux lio a sua capacidade individual e colectiva para resistir a um ataque armado
7103302 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7103303 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7103304 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7103305 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7103306 i think it has zero impact on who mccains going to pick
7103307 in the end the job of the vice presidential candidate is to keep the spotlight on the presidential candidate
7103308 i think mitt would do a great job of keeping that spotlight on mccain
7103309 russian president dmitry medvedev is the guy that influenced obama in choosing biden
7103310 undercut the concern that you cant pick romney because they didnt get along
7103311 that was one of the key things romney ran on
7103312 that he can go to washington take an outsiders perspective and change the way things are done
7103313 romney demonstrated that he is a very good debater in the primaries
7103314 biden is a very good debater and its not very difficult to imagine him out debating romney
7103315 and not just on foreign policy he would really make romney look bad
7103316 romney doesnt know much about foreign policy and the gap between them would be striking
7103317 its not that mccains running mate needs to be strong on foreign policy but he has to at least be able to talk sensibly about it
7103318 it would be a dream come true for the democrats to have these two guys on the ticket biden will love to play the populist demagogue and hes much better at going on the attack than obama is
7103319 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro

7103379 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7103380 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7103381 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7103382 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7103383 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7103384 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7103385 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7103386 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7103387 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7103388 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7103389 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7103390 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7103391 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7103392 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7103393 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7103394 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7103395 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7103396 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7103397 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7103398 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7103399 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7103400 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7103401 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7103402 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7103403 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7103404 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7103405 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7103406 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7103407 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7103408 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7103409 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7103410 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7103411 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7103412 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7103413 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7103414 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7103415 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7103416 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7103417 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7103418 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7103419 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7103420 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7103421 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7103422 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7103423 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7103424 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7103425 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7103426 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7103427 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7103428 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7103429 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7103430 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7103431 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7103432 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7103433 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7103434 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7103435 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7103436 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7103437 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7103438 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7103439 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7103440 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7103441 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7103442 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7103443 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7103444 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7103445 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7103446 i first met john mccain when he became the navys liaison to the united states senate when i was republican leader
7103447 he traveled abroad with me on many occasions and i had the opportunity to observe first hand his ability to relate with foreign leaders i have a high regard respect and confidence in his unique ability to lead our country as our next president
7103448 the volunteer state is uniting behind john mccain because he has the judgment integrity and experience to lead
7103449 former senator baker and i have been friends and colleagues for many years his guidance and leadership will be a tremendous asset to my campaign i am also very grateful for the support of our entire tennessee team and i am confident their hard work and efforts will result in victory on november 4th
7103450 surrealist dance hall destroy all red button shouts what are we going to do cajsa deleted the collaboration
7103451 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7103452 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7103453 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7103454 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7103455 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7103456 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7103457 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7103458 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7103459 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7103460 who are open to doing something on the production side
7103461 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7103462 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7103463 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7103464 some people are very good at closing the deal others are better at keeping to it

7103487 se piensa que esa joven tiene muy claro todo pero resulta que a la hora de las relaciones sexuales no sabe c mo cuidarse o piensa que el hombre sabe c mo hacerlo ah pueden aparecer riesgos como un embarazo no planificado enfermedades o decisiones que toman y de las cu les despu s se arrepienten
7103488 en celsam hicimos un estudio y muchas chicas de 18 a 20 a os se arrepintieron de haberse iniciado sexualmente a temprana edad en muchos casos sintieron la necesidad de hacerlo para pertenecer a un grupo o porque las dem s lo hac an pero a veces ser distinto no es malo

7103501 i would have preferred hillary but that is not to be
7103502 with biden it helps me a little bit i think it is a good choice he has seniority he knows a lot about foreign police and he seems very intelligent i think it will be a good combo
7103503 it is a less than sensational pick if he had picked hillary the news would not have been able to talk about anything else
7103504 our country is more screwed up now than it has been at any other point in my life
7103505 i just dont think obama has the experience to run our country
7103506 i have every confidence that we are about to put forward two men of principle who have a vision for the country and who can articulate that vision in a way that they are going to get the majority of the votes in the majority of the states so that we win and we dont have a third term of george bush which i think mccain represents
7103507 but what hes said about obama before this about how he is not experienced and how mccain is probably the best man running you know mccain is going to run those comments on tv

7103513 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7103514 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7103515 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7103516 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7103517 i spent a large amount of time failing to find anything and a small amount succeeding

7103529 a fluid confederation of political societies and monities a monity is a political society of one that is regulated by an interpolitical governing body
7103530 it would be necessary for this governing body to possess limited powers which encompass the overseeing of the drawing of the boundaries that demarcate these societies and monities and the settling of disputes that might arise among these parties while the legitimate authority of the governments of the various societies would be based upon consent the legitimate authority of this governing body would not necessarily be so based given the disorder and chaos which would ensue in the absence of such a governing body all individuals would legitimately be subject to its authority even those who do not consent to it hence the ideal of political societies as voluntary associations would need to be underpinned by involuntary governance at the interpolitical level

7103568 the way your brain works so differently from anything ive seen but mostly
7103569 if you told me about your day i would win fifty bucks out of you right now that you did at least six things normal people think about and wouldnt dare big or small you have blind faith in yourself and you actually really dont give a shit about what anyone else thinks
7103570 shush my borderline insanity is not in the same category as yours so dont try to share
7103571 and you sort of shrug it to dust and walk on like nothing happened
7103572 but youre so full of life and wonder and discovery youre more alive than anyone else i ever met and though i adore all the rest too i think thats what really makes you so much more breathtaking than everything else before
7103573 when you were what we were 17 and 23ish here fifteen there and you summoned me for the first time
7103574 i had no idea you were ten at the time
7103575 i was saying i know it wasnt sex because that didnt come up for a long time afterward so you werent the average fifteen year old boy and that was impressive but what were you looking for
7103576 it was a really dark place for me and and i just wanted to know if anybody anywhere would ever even understand me
7103577 girls then were like i dont know and i was like well i was pretty much this
7103578 awww when every newly whiskered jackass was looking for his first piece of ass you just wanted a girlfriend
7103579 oh and now youre defending your delayed sense of masculinity thats not really going to impress your bride my love so go drunkenly announce it to the boys and make them wonder if i was such a dominatrix your virginitys still intact that would be more impressive
7103580 stop it you know i dont like talking about that time of my life and obviously i was totally wrong about you ever understanding me and all that shit youre insensitive and youre a fraud too
7103581 here you are teasing me about shit that that i thought was over and done with ages ago youre such a bitch
7103582 however the people at the factory fucked up your model im quite pleased with the fact that it ruined you forever to be insatiable and cuddly

7103748 this probably accounts for more colorectal cancers than all other gene mutations discovered thus far
7103749 the reasonable expectation is this finding will save some lives
7103750 we will be able to identify a larger number of individuals that are at risk of colorectal cancer and in the long term maybe decrease the cases of colorectal cancer and of people dying from it by being able to screen them more frequently

7103755 newer evidence describes how curcumin interacts with certain proteins to generate anti cancer activity inside the body were focusing on the pathways that are most involved in cancer and trying to optimize for those properties
7103756 most of the interaction between our compound and the overactive protein comes from what are called hot spots on the proteins surface
7103757 for each spot we can design small chemical fragments and link them together to make a molecule this is what computer aided design and modeling can do
7103758 very small changes that may seem insignificant can have dramatic effects on these toxicity properties
7103759 but most of the compounds weve made have been more potent than curcumin against the cancer cells
7103760 to be able to develop a drug that in the future could have potential to treat 50 percent of these cancers would be a major contribution
7103761 the b cells have been waiting for at least 60 years if not 90 years for that flu to come around again
7103762 thats amazing because its the longest memory anyones ever demonstrated
7103763 these are some of the most potent antibodies ever isolated against a virus
7103764 the lessons we are learning about the 1918 flu tell us a lot about what may happen during a future pandemic
7103765 as nanotechnology scientists we face a challenge similar to the one faced by structural biologists half a century ago determining the structure with atomic scale precision of a whole range of nanoscale materials
7103766 if we can understand how peptides self assemble at the surface of a nanoparticle we can open up a route towards the design and synthesis of nanoparticles that have complex surfaces these particles could find applications in the biomedical sciences for example to deliver drugs to a particular target in the body or to design sensitive diagnostic tests in the longer term these particles could also find applications in new generations of electronic components
7103767 bionanotechnology holds great promise for the future we may be able to create stronger lighter and more durable materials or new medical applications basic science and techniques for working at the nanoscale are providing the understanding that will permit future such applications of bionanotechnology
7103768 our study was also able to demonstrate that for patients at an average risk for gi bleeding starting ppi cotherapy at a younger age was marginally cost effective while starting ppi cotherapy at an older age was highly cost effective
7103769 ultimately physicians should discuss the gastrointestinal risks of low dose aspirin with their patients and consider ppi cotherapy
7103770 the stomach normally has a protective coating to prevent acid related injury but aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids impair the stomachs ability to form this barrier coating potentially leading to ulcer formation
7103771 furthermore these drugs may themselves cause injury directly to stomach cells and can impair the ability of platelets to form a plug in the event of bleeding
7103772 many americans are currently taking low dose aspirin for coronary heart disease and we know that ppis are effective in reducing ulcer bleeding in patients on aspirin
7103773 what we didnt know however was whether it is worth paying for these drugs for patients on low dose aspirin who had no other risk factors
7103774 its very clear that eliminating this protein has cardiovascular benefits
7103775 rna based drugs might provide a course of treatment for people whose cholesterol levels are resistant to current drugs or they might be combined with current drugs

7103794 this was a great way to finish the olympics it could have been a world record with a close race but we all ran comfortable out there

7103800 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster
7103801 there is a growing understanding that government can play a positive role in investing in our country
7103802 joe and i will appear for the first time as running mates this afternoon in springfield illinois the same place this campaign began more than 19 months ago
7103803 cest la vie in american politics and most voters i guess
7103804 a noun a verb and 9 11 shot at giuliani
7103805 the millionaires boys club two guys two many houses to remember
7103806 are america or you better off now than you were 8 years ago
7103807 if i remember correctly biden had brain surgery for a tumor or something like that the hair transplants came after the operation though it was more than ten years ago its likely to come up on one way or the other
7103808 in february 1988 biden was hospitalized for two brain aneurysms which kept him from the senate for seven months
7103809 whatever else bidens selection means it suggests obama ismt overly concerned about electoral numbers
7103810 obama made a strategic error he just lost indiana in the electoral polls and mccain moved ahead of him 274 265 the choice for obama was obvious evan b of indiana
7103811 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7103812 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent
7103813 and i doubt mccain can pick as relatively well for himself
7103814 the only area where i see romney possibly being a problem is the mormon christianity conflict
7103815 we have the greatest and smoothest liars in the world
7103816 we are hurting because they keep taking more and spending more
7103817 biden is gonna slice and dice mccain over the next 3 months plenty of material to work with be afraid biden will be on every political talk show ripping mcbush on all the things the media has given him a pass on
7103818 of those have been confirmed archaologically found in the bible look it up on your own
7103819 many most of those have been confirmed archaologically found in the bible look it up on your own
7103820 i want to make it clear that i totally oppose the surging of additional american troops into baghdad i think it is contrary to the overwhelming body of informed opinion a surge of up to 30 000 american troops cannot have any positive effect except for only temporary we have to make it clear to the iraqis that in this quarter were going to begin to draw down american troops the overwhelming reason for that is we must force a political settlement they must understand that there is no prospect for us to be able to bring peace to iraq if the iraqis dont want peace as much as we do
7103821 really smart guys who made a very very very very bad bet and it blew up in their faces
7103822 they have no answer about how badly they screwed it up
7103823 and now all you see is nancy pelosi as the face of that party
7103824 you know that i was in a pow concentration camp during the vietnam war and was tortured dont you
7103825 would you libs please tell me what obamas done in the senate
7103826 the only thing thats going to change is the faces
7103827 i will give you this at least this time it is not on how knowledgeable you are about all things pertaining to sodomy and how
7103828 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7103829 the first mainstream african american presidential candidate who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7103830 look at the things that have mccains name on them
7103831 going for weekend of beer drinking and sex and yes with the opposite sex
7103832 in naming my colleague and friend joe biden to be the vice presidential nominee barack obama has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7103833 conservatives will blast bidens record just as surely as liberals will or should celebrate it but one of the virtues of having biden as the vice presidential nominee is that he wont take those kinds of attacks lightly hell fight back hell remind people rightly that being a liberal democrat means raising the minimum wage making sure everybody has affordable health care providing strong public schools and protecting human rights then hell ask why conservative republicans dont want the same things thats exactly the kind of political debate this country needs by picking biden as a running mate obama has signaled that he welcomes this argument and intends finally to win it
7103834 i think the two of them are going to get along splendidly and have a lot of infectious fun using john mccain as a punching bag
7103835 i think the two of them are going to get along splendidly and have a lot of infectious fun using john mccain as a punching bag
7103836 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7103837 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7103838 no one on the democratic side knows more about foreign policy than sen biden
7103839 hes been an articulate spokesman on the subject he also knows about domestic policy hes been a leader on crime control
7103840 hell fight back hell remind people rightly that being a liberal democrat means raising the minimum wage making sure everybody has affordable health care providing strong public schools and protecting human rights then hell ask why conservative republicans dont want the same things thats exactly the kind of political debate this country needs
7103841 ya and pay for all of it off of the hard working people who made something of thier lives
7103842 thier will be no middle class when you tax the shit out of large companies
7103843 you said i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is
7103844 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7103845 would you libs please tell me what obamas done in the senate
7103846 jim geraghty writes the campaign spot blog for nro posted by murphy
7103847 i remember earlier this year you thought the fix was in for hilary the primaries were just bread and circuses for the masses for her inevitable presidency

7103849 mollify the estrogen driven women whod vote against everything they stand for out of spite
7103850 once again barack obama proves his lack of judgement experience and decency barack obama is not qualified to be president big media tool barack obama has finally made a decision and chosen big media favorite joe biden to join the chicago circus biden is an experience patch on the flat tire of experience which is barack obama this deflated tire wont roll
7103851 why are you and others also so quick to put down america or take the side of our enemies
7103852 by picking a guy whos been in the senate for almost as long as ive been alive

7103941 el hombre en cierta manera nace predestinado para lo que debe ser
7103942 todos los modelos desde el comunismo radical hasta el socialismo atenuado que predican la igualdad de la riqueza
7103943 radicalmente contrarios a la esencia misma del hombre y por ello aunque se llamen modelos progresistas constituyen un claro atentado al progreso porque contrar an y suprimen el natural institnto del hombre a desigualarse que es lo que ha enriquecido al mundo y eleveado el nivel de vida de los pueblos
7103944 el hombre es desigual biol gicamente nadie duda hoy que se heredan los caracteres f sicos como la estatura el color de la piel y tambi n el cociente intelectual la igualdad biol gica no es pues posible pero tampoco lo es la igualdad social no es posible la igualdad del poder pol tico

7103950 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7103951 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7103952 it creates a troubling perception when washington policy makers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7103953 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7103954 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7103955 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7103956 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7103957 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7103958 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7103959 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7103960 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7103961 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7103962 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7103963 the iraqi government wants this agreement to be valid just for three years
7103964 the full withdrawal will depend on the situation on the ground and the needs of iraqis and the decisions of the iraqi government
7103965 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7103966 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7103967 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7103968 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7103969 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7103970 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7103971 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7103972 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7103973 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7103974 reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals
7103975 judging by the conduct of mr tsvangirai i have no doubt that zimbabweans are a determined people
7103976 but daddy how would we be heard by the world if we do not speak in english

7103982 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7103983 you the others dont know what weve been doing in the dark confocal room
7103984 improving water productivity and reducing the quantity of food wasted can enable us to provide a better diet for the poor and enough food for growing populations
7103985 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities
7103986 the timing of course is simply the timing of when the agreement was completed
7103987 russian aggression played on the polish public very strong and was a factor in making this happen this quickly
7103988 as russian ballistic missiles rain down on georgia we should honor our commitment to allies in poland and the czech republic
7103989 the events in georgia have nothing to do with the interceptors the u s is considering deploying in poland and congress believes that this system is untested and fails to defend against current and emerging threats
7103990 why would they call it building 7 if it were the 3rd building to fall
7103991 why would they call it building 7 if it were the 3rd building to fall
7103992 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7103993 amid the controversies of the ministerial hierarchy the cpn uml will stay out of the government
7103994 we have not said we wont accept cpn uml leader in the second position in the protocol ranking we are ready to show flexibility regarding this
7103995 when i first saw a briefing on the predator three years ago i saw one of my mission sets disappear i miss the thrill of flying but hanging around for hours in a plane is a waste of manpower
7103996 we have just won a war with a lot of heroes flying around in planes the next war may be fought by airplanes with no men in them at all
7103997 it is possible to build a transoceanic missile right now
7103998 but we dont know whether it will land in spain portugal or france
7103999 uavs success is not due to a single breakthrough but a combination of innovations in several areas
7104000 you may not have the fear of death but all the other fears are still there the fear of the unknown and the fear of failure
7104001 paradoxically as a result of our success the target has become even more decentralized even more diffused and presents a more difficult target no question about that
7104002 its clear that the u s is prepared to use and deploy these weapons in a fairly wide theater
7104003 we have the plans in place to do them globally
7104004 in most cases we need the approval of the host country to do them however there are a few countries where the president has decided that we can whack someone without the approval or knowledge of the host government
7104005 an alarming precedent and a clear case of extrajudicial killing
7104006 zawahiri is an easy case no one is going to question us going after him
7104007 but where can you do it and who can you do it against who authorizes it all of these are totally unregulated areas of presidential authority
7104008 paris its easy to say we wont do it there
7104009 i dont think anyone is dealing with solid footing here there is legal as well as operational doctrine that is being developed as we go along
7104010 you give shelter to al qaeda figures you may well get your village blown up
7104011 conversely you have to note that this can also create local animosity and instability
7104012 i think the attack was a major screw up because so many kids died it raises questions about the entire process
7104013 this is a great victory in breaking the siege and the beginning of what we hope will be more and more boats
7104014 we will provide protection for them and will take them to visit al shifa hospital and other parts of gaza city
7104015 we came to help the palestinian people in gaza to lift the siege
7104016 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through
7104017 strong message to the arab people and to arab leaders
7104018 a first step for the international community to end the suffering of the palestinian people in gaza
7104019 weet ik veel daar heb ik nooit zo over na gedacht
7104020 je vertelde gisteren dat en dat maar wat bedoelde je daar mee
7104021 una mente vivace e tranquilla pu essere soddisfatta anche senza vedere nulla e non vede nulla che non le piaccia
7104022 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
7104023 were still going to rep booker back there but were going to try and get quintin a majority of the reps
7104024 were happy with either guy quintin did it in college there and he had a lot of success there in college so we feel like he can get us something back there but again were going to continue to rep both of those guys and as the season goes along well probably end up using both of them before its over with
7104025 the weather conditions didnt help on things there but it was just poor positioning up under the ball
7104026 booker has to make sure he factors in the weather conditions know that theres a bit of a wind thats going to move the ball a bit so its going to change that setup point for you but thats just a matter of experience and the more reps he can get at it the better simulate that in practice situations get some windy days and well catch some balls
7104027 we went 15 games after that first game where we didnt have any ball security issues so i think we are well on track to where we need to be again weve moved on we feel confident in what weve got were ready to go forward from here
7104028 4 times per week but i do a bit everyday
7104029 other guys will have to step up for the time hes out
7104030 kevin goes down i have to step up and fill his shoes
7104031 the ideal place is a team that is on the next step from winning the super bowl
7104032 i know i can play 2 3 more years i have been waiting 13 years to win a super bowl i wish i could have the opportunity to play for a team that would use me and bring me in
7104033 by the time i get to phoenix shell be rising
7104034 for when eric eats a banana an amazing transformation occurs eric is bananaman ever alert for the call to action
7104035 the war against terror has to be pursued through a co operative effort between afghanistan pakistan the north atlantic treaty organisation nato and the us
7104036 unfortunately there was no chemistry between general r pervez musharraf and afghan president hamid karzai which did not facilitate co operation between the two countries i think we will see a more co operative phase after musharraf
7104037 i do not think induction of nato or american troops on the pakistani side is even something that anybody seriously considers
7104038 metal gear solid 4 is a breathtaking stealth shooter with heart and one of the best games ever made
7104039 the increased spiral of adult deaths in so many countries means that the number of children orphaned each day is expanding exponentially africa is staggering under the load
7104040 altijd blijven lachen want als je lacht ben je nog mooier
7104041 obviously we didnt have the success we wanted to have last year and we had some room to improve
7104042 thats one area anytime you have that speed on the field you can open up some seams there you have that possibility of stretching the field were definitely excited about those guys
7104043 thats the thing last year being so close on several opportunities we were a block away it was good to finally put those together
7104044 it wasnt the worst one weve seen it wasnt the simplest one weve seen
7104045 i felt great the thing about it is the fact that we are progressing week in and week out last week was kind of mixed emotions because of the conditions and the weather we had several key mistakes so we were able to learn from that i thought this week coming out here we were able to put some things together consistently we sustained some drives and came out with points which was big for us
7104046 i think you have to give guys opportunities to make plays and we did that today its obviously big when you lose somebody like kevin curtis who had 77 catches last year and then you dont have your other top receiver in reggie brown i think the preseason gives guys an opportunity to come out and showcase their talents and do great things for us we have a ways to go but its a good sign
7104047 i think he was able to get his feet up under him its a little different than practicing every day now in a game situation he was able to get his feet under him and get some more game experience for this year thats the part of it that is going to take some time but its just like riding a bike once you get your feel youll be right back in there
7104048 i think when you look at the guys and the way theyve continued to improve week in and week out not just the ones but also the twos and threes you are looking at guys making plays and youre excited to see that because they are working hard throughout training camp

7104059 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
7104060 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
7104061 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
7104062 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
7104063 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
7104064 you work for years to built that invincibility knowing that at some point its going to break the mirror is going to break

7104066 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
7104067 its always been difficult to beat all these guys its just not so easy to keep it up all the time eventually sometimes they get you
7104068 i think thats maybe what i feel most this year you know just losing too many matches
7104069 i look forward to the u s open i still have really this and then the masters cup in shanghai to really do well now try to save my season
7104070 the last years i did very well too i was very happy being the no 2 so finally im no 1
7104071 i dont have time to celebrate so probably after new york after davis cup im going to have a good time
7104072 i feel like im playing really solid and much better than i have been all year to be honest i really look forward to it

7104083 you know selling china in 2008 is like selling america in 1908 sure lets say the market goes down another 40 so what you look back over 100 years you look back from the beauty of 1928 or even 1938 in the depths of the great depression and there is somebody who bought shares in 1908 he was still a lot better off having not sold in 1908
7104084 we dont even bother to hope anymore that somebody will come to protect us
7104085 they dont come out and say they want us off the land but they are forcing us off
7104086 they put a kalashnikov to my chest and said do you have money gold or a car
7104087 i started crying and one of them said dont worry we wont do anything wrong to you
7104088 the militias are still coming theyre still driving through and robbing us
7104089 when cars come through were just hiding there is nobody to protect us and were very scared
7104090 the soldiers dont say anything to us they only enter in houses and ask for food and drink

7104092 they were entering into yards and making inquiries and if they found them they shot them
7104093 it was horrible of course but i told myself i had to do it

7104136 what weve done shows that people can do what governments should have done if people stand up against injustice we can truly be the conscience of the world

7104143 we are coming apart at the seams in every sense
7104144 nearly two months to have a pair of trousers mended which had been torn by a not completely screwed down screw on a jump seat meanwhile alitalia is back in the news with plans of new cuts they want to make but i have already made my cuts
7104145 once again we are short of cutlery so i am hard at work washing re washing and drying
7104146 there is a meal missing either it wasnt loaded or there are more passengers than we had booked
7104147 the undercarriage is nude without mudguards the plane can only fly if it doesnt rain we are fine until the end of september but only in the south nothing to put security at risk
7104148 if one is not in line with the norms and dictates alitalia does not take off
7104149 international statistics confirm that alitalia is one of the most secure airlines in the world
7104150 perhaps aviator az does not take into account the delicate situation in which we find ourselves
7104151 vlm airlines is honoured to receive this prestigious award which is a powerful endorsement of service from the people that really matter passengers we are dedicated to providing the highest levels of service and strive continually to set new standards
7104152 this award is particularly pleasing in that it demonstrates quality of service and service clearly matter to customers on short haul services vlm airlines were strongly supported in this survey category and were frequently singled out for the high standards of staff service they deliver the award is very much a recognition of the those customer facing staff
7104153 tired of staying at home for the holidays what a great way to spend it by drowning your sorrows in alcohol because your team went from 6 in the ap poll to 6 6 and without a bowl bid at the end of the year and whats more perfect to keep your drink cold than an ironic coozie that was made just a little too soon what makes it better is that this coozie is as rare as the gamecocks postseason appearances 13 overall 4 9 0 record seeing as the gamecocks have a 521 523 44 479 winning percentage record in their storied 116 years of football youre going to have to drink to watch them play so why not keep it cold

7104163 we are trying to reposition what homelessness is in the mind of the average resident of this county
7104164 we are trying to dispel myths and portray what homelessness really is in riverside county
7104165 we just want to know what conclusion they come to because we havent heard any justification as to why they did what they did
7104166 if they have a legitimate reason why then thats an explanation but if they dont have that legitimate reason there needs to be some consequences and some new procedures in place
7104167 i dont think we can make a quid pro quo there that this is causing the effect and they certainly dont deserve that behavior but we do have some of these stands that have been victimized by these activities

7104176 there were no skyline shots or expo building or anything but i was like oh hey
7104177 i think its a regional thing where people like to watch something they know is produced locally
7104178 its just the fantasy of knowing thats someone you could run into somewhere
7104179 when youre shooting in regina and winnipeg nobody there has any illusions that theyre going to be huge movie stars
7104180 i wish i could say oh yes there is a canadian aesthetic youll always see canoes and snowshoes
7104181 but really it just tends to be lower budget and amateur
7104182 i think its an interesting opportunity to promote canadian entertainment
7104183 this isnt stuff thats going to be shown on cbc
7104184 as canadians we want to be able to not only see ourselves but support our country
7104185 i think theres a difference in what we produce whether its literature or pornography
7104186 capture the essence of their sexuality and the intimacy that is occurring
7104187 i have visions of ski cabins and things like that because we try to get outside whenever we can
7104188 but unless theres a vancouver aesthetic in peoples interiors it will be hard for people to know where its from maybe theyll be able to tell by the smallness of the apartments

7104192 through its orchestrated campaigns affecting all those involved in the use of medicines the pharmaceutical industry enormously influences what patients are prescribed on the whole these influences are detrimental to best practice
7104193 declarations of interest are a key way to help break the pharmaceutical industrys stranglehold it is not a trivial issue public declarations by doctors are essential if prescribing is to be sensible and appropriate and according to patients needs
7104194 when a medical professional speaks on a health issue we assume that they are putting patients interests first if that person has a conflict of interest because they or their organisation are receiving funding from a drug company the least we should demand is the right to know about it
7104195 pharmaceutical companies will tell you that what they are funding is medical education but our concern is that this is really highly effective well targeted marketing this throws any notion of impartiality out of the window and jeopardises a doctors ability to make an informed balanced decision about the most appropriate treatments
7104196 countries such as the us and australia have woken up to this issue and are now requiring pharmaceutical companies to disclose their funding of medical organisations and medical education european regulators have been sleeping on the job
7104197 its not true its part of a huge marketing budget its all about maximising their profits not helping people in life threatening situations
7104198 if it is done through the local rep who may expect some sort of favour in exchange for that sponsorship there is more stringent regulation
7104199 those doctors are seeing reps on a regular basis and although it is explicitly stated in the abpi rules that there shouldnt be any conflict or conditions on the funding it probably does influence doctors behaviour because they are unsure whether they will get further sponsorship for going to further meetings so it is useful to them to engender good relationships with different reps
7104200 one has to be careful how one judges oneself but when you get to my level where you are getting a lot of interest from different companies you can pick and choose to a certain extent if you feel uncomfortable about any particular request or association you can very easily walk away if im asked to put certain points across in a talk which i think are biased i wont do it in the best interests of patient care
7104201 i certainly think it would be preferable if sponsorship or money for travelling to meetings was independent from the pharmaceutical companies but there is no pot of money for providing that
7104202 i dont give a toss what the drug company rep says i prescribe drugs which give benefit to my patients
7104203 i think were afraid because ultimately in sex were going to meet god
7104204 to leave me all on fire with a great love of god
7104205 what the poem suggests is that spirit is more like a lover than a lawgiver or judge
7104206 and that living in harmony with spirit is more like falling in love than living up to an external standard of rightness
7104207 if our ability to love makes us most like god then it stands to reason that when we make love we might be in our most holy state should we break out the linens candles incense flowers and wine o god yes great sex is not only possible its divine
7104208 wiping them dry with her long sensuous hair it always knocks me out reminding me of the intimate christian connection between sacredness and vulnerable flesh
7104209 it appears that the peaks of sexual and spiritual connection among christians were more holistic
7104210 involving full body gratification as well as emotional and spiritual highs
7104211 this study demonstrates that peak sexual union requires mutual trust in the security of a committed relationship with another person just as spiritual union requires unquestioned trust in god
7104212 i think god desires sex to be as whole and complete as possible to include the whole body mind and soul why settle for something less for just physical pleasure when you can have the whole thing
7104213 i think jesus was celibate but that doesnt mean he wasnt sexual
7104214 people loved him and were in awe of him i think there was a lot of sexual energy there
7104215 weve found the more were connected with god the better our sex lives

7104220 but by the same token we know these very same people are not interested in less religiosity in the political discourse they almost universally want a religious person as president
7104221 its not that they want to take religion out of politics its that their frustrations with the way things seem to be going are leading them to say well maybe churches should back off on this

7104233 uh oh i am getting into political danger conversations now
7104234 no one can win an election running on that but your point is well taken
7104235 like a heavy weight fighter a little past prime getting knocked about on the ropes and just having to react to each punch rather than having a strategy for a complex multi round fight
7104236 short term optics of politics and pleasing a base with no ability to have this conversation
7104237 if more business leaders start talking about these things congress will have to listen

7104373 its not like nadal has come out of nowhere hes been around just behind federer for three years so for him to stay another three years right at the top of the game is going to be very difficult hes probably going to dominate the clay for the next few years but on other surfaces i dont think he can dominate like federer did
7104374 the only time ive seen him look nervous on the court was in the wimbledon final this year and i think that was huge for him to come through that in the end
7104375 suffering every time the czechs counter attacked he merely highlighted the question of why someone else had not been introduced to help gareth barry plug the gaps in midfield
7104376 today england have no emerson therefore we have no holding midfielder
7104377 for the first time we played without fear at wembley heaven knows how bad england will be when they get to croatia and once more discover as on the october night two years ago when eduardo and a malign fate left them ragged that disparate egos are no match for a real team
7104378 arturs his pal but it looks as though hell be out for a couple of their games
7104379 lukasz is close to the stage where hes going to be pushing him all the way and its only a matter of time before he gets there hes a great shot stopper and hes pulled off quite a few important saves for us now
7104380 thats one point on the board for us and its going to be a long season
7104381 its our ambition to finish in the top six but we dont need to be there tonight

7104389 the fed over reacted to the slowdown in economic activity
7104390 it cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7104391 the official policy rate is a rather ineffective tool for addressing liquidity and solvency issues
7104392 i do not agree that the best that can be done is for the authorities to clean up the mess after the bubble bursts

7104394 why miss hot cocoa you heart anthropologie its like your mother ship
7104395 throughout the 12 months of the crisis it is difficult to avoid the impression that the fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions and too responsive to their special pleadings to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole
7104396 if no countervailing actions are taken what would be perceived as an implicit expansion of the safety net could exacerbate the problem of too big to fail possibly resulting in excessive risk taking and yet greater systemic risk in the future
7104397 it creates a troubling perception when washington policymakers appear to be hitting the fast forward button when major institutions are on the line but are between the pause and the slow motion button when massive home foreclosures are on the line
7104398 market participants failed to soundly manage measure and disclose risks with ignorance greed or hubris playing their customary roles
7104399 the alarms of the financial sector have been overstated the real economy has slowed down but is not yet in severe difficulty
7104400 it headed off disaster the history of financial crises tells you the economy doesnt get sick the next week it takes a while
7104401 in the case of bear stearns it is not clear from publicly available information how much contagion there would have been had it been allowed to fail
7104402 what has been done until now has been pretty well done itseems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7104403 when you can get an adverse feedback loop that arguesthat what you need to do is act more aggressively
7104404 i hope the people of henley will bear in mind that at least half my antecedents are actually english i know it looks like im some kind of foreign toff here which is not necessarily good pr but at least half of my antecedents are english english loads of them

7104446 leaving san jose anytime between 5 and 7 p m is just nuts said robert cox who rides the train there from his home in redwood city ive seen people get bumped a lot and its just going to get worse thats not news to caltrain which recently completed a report that recommends several possible solutions such as building more bike lockers at stations starting a bike sharing program or charging a fee for allowing bikes during peak ridership hours but bikers who now make up an estimated 8 percent of caltrains weekday riders say the report misses the point and that the train services should free up some space for their bikes either by removing more seats or adding more train cars
7104447 caltrains bicycle parking and access plan released last week gives a broad look at issues bicyclists face when using caltrain it was initially called the bicycle master plan but cyclists complained that it focused on parking and access at caltrain stations and ignored the 80 percent of cyclists who carry their bikes on the train so the name was changed but bikers say the focus didnt change much
7104448 i have had to learn the simplest things last which made for difficulties
7104449 the world has not forgotten the people of this land today we are all from gaza
7104450 we recognize that were two humble boats but what weve accomplished is to show that average people from around the world can mobilize to create change we do not have to stay silent in the face of injustice reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
7104451 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing
7104452 what weve done shows that people can do what governments should have done if people stand up against injustice we can truly be the conscience of the world

7104457 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7104458 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7104459 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7104460 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7104461 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7104462 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7104463 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7104464 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7104465 bill when someone is serving you humble pie why do you keep coming for seconds

7104468 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7104469 out of the heartbreak of that unspeakable accident he did more than become a senator he raised a family
7104470 that is the measure of the man standing next to me that is the character of joe biden

7104518 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention to arrive safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride

7104571 the fact that mccain cannot recognize the importance of that era and the contributions of citizens who lived through it is representative of a larger problem for him the time he spent in captivity was a defining time for those of us back home there were so many socially profound events that altered just about everyone who lived through them john mccain was not one of them the history that shaped millions of americans mccain only heard about secondhand after the fact

7104810 nigeria produces almost 45 of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7104811 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7104812 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7104813 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7104814 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts at reducing theirs
7104815 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries

7104821 theyre both explosive and theyre young and they have a lot of energy
7104822 and i have to keep one eye on each of them i mean theyve got some personality now but they love to play and they bring great energy to the football team and the veteran players love watching them
7104823 i felt the punter got a good kick on it and kind of outkicked his coverage
7104824 i just did a great job of catching the ball and making two moves to the side and hitting the seam and getting right up the middle from there it was nothing but daylight
7104825 i definitely wanted to show that i still have fundamentals and i still know my plays and protections
7104826 i also wanted to use this game as a measuring stick for my conditioning to see where i was and where i need to get i was very pleased with the exception of a couple of plays thats something were going to work on we didnt work on it much but thats not an excuse we are going to get better we still have two weeks to go it was just like old times for the most part
7104827 of course there are some things we need to iron out as a group and were going to get them ironed out
7104828 everybody hears it why dont we have a big stud but if you can get that out of your mind for one second i know its difficult for a lot of people but we think we have six really really good receivers
7104829 why do you want to be with me for its not like i really loved you
7104830 we need to start games with more authority if we want to stay at the top
7104831 it is harsh to lose the game but it is fair to say fulham played well
7104832 they were sharp and didnt allow us enough chances to win the game in the midfield we were dominated we werent sharp or quick enough and we suffered in there
7104833 players have been away on international duty and the performance wasnt the best
7104834 ive been a player and ive been away with england many times and it is hard to get going again
7104835 i had about an hour with my players yesterday and i think it showed in the second half we played into hulls hands
7104836 that was a disappointing aspect but we did it to everton last week so it evens itself out in the end
7104837 to be fair when you go ahead theyve got to start coming out and playing and that probably opens things out for us to go further ahead
7104838 but to concede straight after our goal was really really disappointing defensively we werent at the races
7104839 paul robinson could do nothing about it the header could have gone anywhere but it goes in off the post
7104840 but overall they deserved their point and could even have won it at the end
7104841 it was an exciting game to be fair and were always trying to win it and make it exciting for people
7104842 but sometimes and ive said this to the lads when youre tired and you know youre tired its important you have a bank of four and another bank of four and be hard to beat

7104856 if you look at the intensity of the game we did what had to be done but we did it the hard way today i am pleased
7104857 if we look at the momentum of the game the result was just but it was not straightforward i am very happy with the composure of the team
7104858 we let them in towards the end somewhat softly but in any event we were up against a side which is capable
7104859 most importantly we were patient in the way we met their physicality
7104860 ive been here many times and we have fallen short and i am very impressed with this groups performance especially because it is some of the guys first times in south africa
7104861 today all 20 guys showed spirit and determination and played their hearts out
7104862 it was not nice being out there especially after i felt we had the firepower to win the game and the opportunities
7104863 if we maybe took some of our chances in the first half we would not have found ourselves in this situation
7104864 the fans have the right to be unhappy south africa are a proud nation they want to be winners and want to back a winning side we will never go out and lose a game on purpose
7104865 we have a new playing style that we are trying put out there and rome wasnt built in a day we ask that they be more patient on the time they give us to come to grips with what we want to do

7105023 well now why on earth would we consult anything but un approved documents have you lost your wait ah j hahahahahaha you droll fellow you i have said it before and i will say it again i like thy wit well junker one does guffaw when j is around your witty comedic musings are clever as always j isnt that right mickael
7105024 i hope you enjoyed your flight down in my personal jet i like to treat my guests properly and of course the flights emissions are cancelled out by eco credits
7105025 of course of course say my invite said most of the party was going to be held outdoors too bad about the cold weather kind of weird for march in nashville eh
7105026 well as you obviously know from watching my award winning documentary film an inconvenient truth this cold weather is just another blatant sign of global warming
7105027 riiiigggght speaking of that did you catch the latest news about that seemingly inexplicable global warming taking place on mars
7105028 well as you obviously know from watching my award winning documentary film an inconvenient truth that global warming taking place on mars is just another blatant sign of global warming
7105029 ah huh and whats your take on the recently published data regarding historic temperatures on earth that seem to suggest that we are actually in a cool period historically
7105030 well as you obviously know from watching my award winning documentary film an inconvenient truth that is just another blatant sign of global warming
7105031 yep say al did you catch the giants game last night
7105032 well as you obviously know from watching my award winning documentary film an inconvenient truth that is just another blatant sign of global warming
7105033 sure sure well it was good talking to you al great little shindig youve got here
7105034 barack and i share an american story he was raised by a single mom she taught him to work hard and fight for it i was an irish catholic kid from scranton but i was taught to believe its not how many times you get knocked down but how quickly you get up thats your story americas story
7105035 we as a nation can afford 4 more years of this
7105036 middle class families are falling behind talking about home values falling economy etc
7105037 mccain doesnt have to worry about paying his bills he has to worry about which of his kitchen tables to sit at
7105038 we believe with every fiber of our being that there isnt a single solitary challenge we cant face if we level with the american people when have americans ever ever ever ever let their country down when they had a leader to lead them
7105039 theres a missing piece leadership i have never seen washington so broken so many dreams denied politicians escaping accountability
7105040 you learn a lot about a man when you debate him 12 13 times campaigns test and challenge ive watched barack meet those challenges with steel in his spine hes inspired millions to this new cause during those 18 months ive been disappointed in mccain who gave in and yielded to the swiftboaters he deplored this is a test of character and leadership and one candidate has passed that test barack has a vision but he has the courage to make this a better place hes a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7105041 he made his mark in the senate from day one reached across the aisle passed ethics reform i watched him spontaneously focusing on the shameful neglect of wounded at walter reed hospital theres something about this guy that allows people to come together that if they make compromises they can make things better but thats the story of his whole life
7105042 we share the same values passed on by our parents that we pass on to our children im here for their future the future of your kids im here for the ones who have been forgotten whose lives are the measure of the american dream this is no ordinary time this may be the last chance to restore americas soul its time for all of us lincoln said to put our feet in the right place its time to make barack obama president
7105043 ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record fundamental decency joe biden for decades hes brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him middle class appeal uniquely suited to put our country back on track
7105044 his family didnt have much money catholic faith you can make it if you try he worked harder than the other guy overcame a stutter tragedy struck his wife and little girl killed in a car accident see post below he was 30 years old tragedy tests us it tests our fortitude and faith he never moved to washington he returned home on a train when senate business was done single dad then remarried has 5 grandchildren son is deploying to iraq yet still takes that train back to wilmington every night he did more than become a senator he raised a family
7105045 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7105046 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7105047 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7105048 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7105049 aquellos que atentan y buscan recortar las libertades y derechos
7105050 i thought i was beyond getting nervous about giving a speech because ive given thousands
7105051 the path that these two people have traveled is uniquely american
7105052 i want to bring it down to a pretty basic level about who they are and why they represent the best of us
7105053 has more in common with most missouri families than john mccain does
7105054 weve tried it john mccains way for 7 1 2 years and it hasnt turned out very well
7105055 weve tried a foreign policy thats just focused just on iraq weve tried economic policies that are all about tax breaks for the very wealthy weve tried giving big oil everything they wanted frankly the results have really kind of stunk
7105056 i hope my two sisters would quit arguing over what i should wear
7105057 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7105058 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7105059 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7105060 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7105061 vull ser el primer michael phelps no el segon mark spitz
7105062 volia fer alguna cosa en aquest esport que ning hagu s fet abans
7105063 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7105064 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7105065 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

7105067 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7105068 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7105069 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7105070 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7105071 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7105072 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7105073 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7105074 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7105075 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7105076 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7105077 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7105078 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7105079 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7105080 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7105081 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7105082 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7105083 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7105084 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7105085 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7105086 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7105087 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina

7105089 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7105090 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7105091 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7105092 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7105093 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7105094 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7105095 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7105096 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7105097 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7105098 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7105099 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7105100 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7105101 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso

7105104 go die in a whole i mean really it doesnt get better than that
7105105 we were all laughing so hard in the office its a lesson on why we have this show in the first place
7105106 i certainly hope this is not the pinnacle but things are certainly the best theyve ever been for me
7105107 it seems like all my ducks are going in the right direction i just hope they dont drink too much grey goose on the way like their owner
7105108 for other people it may be awkward but its certainly not for us
7105109 the minute you see us its clear what were about its a very playful relationship
7105110 i recuse myself from dealing with chelseas salary the business dealings
7105111 i know exactly what e is you have to get some fun out of it
7105112 i dont have a lot of respect for women who play up their sexuality i know im attractive but thats not my best feature whats up here in my head is more important
7105113 i told her very early in her career that it was very hard for a beautiful woman to get laughs
7105114 all the audience sees is the beauty but chelsea pulled it all off brilliantly
7105115 its great to go see american idol being taped because paula abdul has absolutely no idea whats going on
7105116 everybody knows who tori spelling is because no one else has a face like that i just cant control myself when it comes to tori
7105117 in theory a snarky nightly half hour devoted to entertainment culture makes considerable sense for e
7105118 but in chelsea lately the network has gotten the idea right and the talent wrong a kathy griffin with a grating voice that could curve the spine comic chelsea handler has bulldozed her way through the first three episodes unpleasantly lurching from one snide comment to the next
7105119 i make fun of myself so that allows me to make fun of others
7105120 its better if celebrities have a sense of humor about themselves take denise richards she has no sense of humor shes not in on the joke
7105121 if we keep doing the show were doing well be fine
7105122 i love roller coasters so this is my ultimate birthday
7105123 blue haired sparkle jesus is so going on my blog

7105126 pertenencia a la historia del pa s como grupo humano que adem s es depositario de buena parte de la memoria hist rica
7105127 como sujetos activos y no como meros objetos de estudio
7105128 rescatar la memoria hist rica de nuestros pueblos originarios para darles la m s amplia difusi n posible
7105129 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7105130 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7105131 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7105132 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7105133 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7105134 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7105135 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7105136 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7105137 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7105138 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7105139 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7105140 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7105141 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7105142 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7105143 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7105144 aporte potencial de energ as renovables no convencionales y eficiencia energ tica a la matriz el ctrica 2008 2025
7105145 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7105146 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7105147 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7105148 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7105149 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7105150 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7105151 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7105152 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7105153 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7105154 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7105155 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido

7105159 we had ups and we had downs just wanted to end on a high moment
7105160 it doesnt make up for it but its a start to the healing process
7105161 we won more medals it just didnt come from where everyone else thought it should come
7105162 a lot of things happened in this olympics that we werent expecting
7105163 but well use that to build on i know next year at the world championships its going to be different
7105164 the boys ran a good race they ran a tough race bekele took charge

7105168 it was a marketing move we thought it was a pretty interesting strategy the aim was to attract attention the people in the queues told passers by about the iphone
7105169 the aim was to draw peoples attention to the product and to make some buzz around it
7105170 are you a complete and total moron or just aggressively insolent weve talked about this seven times

7105176 fa o parte da base do governo desde 2006 atendendo a um chamamento de um governo de coaliz o n o usamos ainda imagens nem de eduardo campos nem de lula na campanha estamos vendo o momento em que vamos usar
7105177 houve a libera o pol tica do presidente do uso de sua imagem por parte dos aliados mas juridicamente a lei veta a participa o de um integrante de um partido no programa de candidato de outro fora da coliga o politicamente estamos trabalhando para n o confundir o eleitorado
7105178 em 1989 o pc do b foi o nico partido aliado ao lado de lula desde esse ano sempre se aliou a lula nas campanhas a presidente temos responsabilidade e comprometimento grande reconhecido por ele para que chegasse presid ncia

7105184 a tempestade financeira que virou um verdadeiro temporal algumas semanas antes de nosso encontro aqui em jackson hole ainda n o diminuiu e seus efeitos na economia est o aparecendo
7105185 when we play our best like we did in the first half it is possible to beat any team
7105186 its been a while since i scored so its good to get one
7105187 i thought we were a bit unlucky last week but we are really proud of ourselves to put in a performance like this and win against arsenal
7105188 we have a good team spirit in the first half we played really well we got a little bit tired in the second half but managed to see the game out
7105189 our ambitions for the season remain the same we have to stay in this league and it is a very tough one to stay in
7105190 fulham started stronger than us and were quicker into the game
7105191 in the second half it was all us but in fairness credit to fulham
7105192 they were always sharp and motivated and defended very well and we didnt create enough chances to win the game
7105193 it is harsh to lose the game but it is fair to say fulham played well
7105194 in the first half in midfield we were dominated and not strong or quick enough and we suffered
7105195 we tried very hard into the last second of the game but we could not score
7105196 the players are very disappointed but when you want to play at the top you have to start a game better than we did with more authority we were punished

7105221 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7105222 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7105223 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7105224 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7105225 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7105226 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7105227 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7105228 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7105229 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7105230 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7105231 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7105232 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7105233 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7105234 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7105235 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7105236 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7105237 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7105238 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7105239 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7105240 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7105241 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7105242 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7105243 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7105244 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7105245 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7105246 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7105247 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7105248 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7105249 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7105250 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7105251 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7105252 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7105253 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7105254 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7105255 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7105256 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7105257 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7105258 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7105259 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7105260 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7105261 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7105262 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7105263 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7105264 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7105265 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7105266 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7105267 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7105268 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7105269 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7105270 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7105271 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7105272 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7105273 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7105274 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7105275 what has been done until now has been pretty well done it seems to me under those very difficult circumstances
7105276 when you can get an adverse feedback loop that argues that what you need to do is act more aggressively

7105281 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7105282 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7105283 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7105284 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7105285 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7105286 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7105287 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7105288 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7105289 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7105290 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7105291 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7105292 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7105293 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7105294 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7105295 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7105296 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7105297 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7105298 i dont know what our government does period i the obama affect

7105300 we come from 17 countries and we have one common goal and that is to break israels siege of 1 5 million palestinians
7105301 israel has to be held responsible for its policies toward the civilian population they have absolutely no right in international law to declare an economic siege on gaza to harm the civilian population thats a form of collective punishment which is illegal
7105302 our original mission was to sail into gaza open up a sea lane so that they can actually use their sea lane and then break israels siege and to tell the world that the gaza mediterranean belongs to the people of gaza
7105303 we went up in a cable car and a toboggan down so that was really good fun
7105304 sometimes you see all these people walking around and its like oh my god i just walked past an olympic gold medalist

7105310 establishing checkpoints buffer zones are definitely not part of the agreement
7105311 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7105312 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly

7105316 well have to gain trust over a period of time and thats what were going to try to do
7105317 the killing sprees that seem to be enjoyed by the winnipeg police service
7105318 when theres comments that we enjoy a killing spree that to me is very disappointing
7105319 i think the majority of the public supports the police

7105321 we were all dizzy nauseous we were all tired but in the last hour it was like we were recharged
7105322 i cant think of any other reason or any other party with an interest
7105323 we are not experienced sailors as a results there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board
7105324 we are following the development and if they are looking for a provocation we will know how to avoid it
7105325 i brought the kids so if they the activists arrive i can tell them welcome and thank you for not forgetting us
7105326 nobody thinks that these boats will break the siege in a practical way but this is a moral message what is happening in gaza is illegal and inhumane and must be halted
7105327 attests to the israeli distress caused by this international peace initiative
7105328 handful of provocateurs seeking a public relations stunt who initiated a political protest aimed at boosting hamas regime of horrors in gaza
7105329 what kind of contribution does this journey make to the promotion of ideas of reconciliation and compromise none
7105330 many people thought these boats will make a significant contribution to break the siege not only politically but also in terms of brining in goods equipment food and medicine
7105331 however once it turned out these boats contain too little food and mostly activists some people left the beach disappointed
7105332 ive long admired sen joe biden and believe his experience and respect on both sides of the aisle is very important and will offer a strong ticket this fall and potentially a strong voice for working to address the many challenges facing the next administration
7105333 our country will benefit from sen bidens unparalleled service and familiarity with the issues as we have during sen bidens many years in the senate
7105334 i believe that barack obama and joe biden give us a ticket with vision strength experience and determination to lead there is a lot of work to be done and i believe this ticket has the tools to accomplish great things for our nation
7105335 a few years ago joe biden had a similar brain injury to the one i had and in the early days after my injury he was a constant friend to barb and me on the phone and in person joe always encouraged me in my recovery and constantly reminded me that while recovery takes time and is hard i would be back fighting and serving again sooner rather than later he was right and i will be forever grateful for his support and personal friendship

7105349 china is a market that we did not consider to export coffee to but now we think it is a very important opportunity for the introduction of this flagship product
7105350 it would be an opportunity for our coffee if chinese people who now are not used to drinking coffee would begin to do it especially when their market is being reoriented and is demanding new products that are more globalized

7105414 why did the new testament writers suddenly convert from judaism to believing that jesus rose from the dead
7105415 what power did the new testament writers gain by asserting that jesus rose from the dead the answer is none in fact instead of gaining power they got exactly the opposite submission servitude persecution torture and death
7105416 what possible motive did the new testament writers have to make up the resurrection story if it wasnt true
7105417 but since the new testament writers were converted they cant be objective

7105461 how does our country continue to produce men and women like this
7105462 conservatives will blast bidens record just as surely as liberals will or should celebrate it but one of the virtues of having biden as the vice presidential nominee is that he wont take those kinds of attacks lightly hell fight back
7105463 before ron fournier returned to the associated press in march 2007 the veteran political reporter had another professional suitor john mccains presidential campaign
7105464 in october 2006 the mccain team approached fournier about joining the fledgling operation fournier was considered for a senior advisory role in communications

7105472 theyre not going to come out of this the same company they went in
7105473 it makes absolute sense because it means they are getting the problems out of their balance sheet
7105474 they might have a certain exposure anyway but the construction of the deal is such that they will be able participate from any gains in the value of the assets
7105475 have been viewed as safer places to hide during the credit crisis we think investors may reduce exposure to these names in the near term schorr wrote
7105476 by way of additional background at the end of the housing bubble from 2000 to 2006 home prices had risen nationwide by 74 while median incomes across the nation had risen by only 15 during the same period rental income from the portion of the housing market that is not owner occupied grew only slightly more than the rate of inflation the resulting divergence in ownership vs occupancy costs of residential real estate created a situation in which for the first time in modern american history it became more expensive on an after tax basis for someone to carry the costs of owning a home as compared with the cost of renting one
7105477 speaker pelosis office has incredible knowledge about transportation and they have been crucial partners for everything from projects t third light rail in the central subway to these bus maintenance grants
7105478 the democrats can usually depend on the mainstream media accepting their narratives uncritically while the republicans can expect them to punch holes in their storylines
7105479 every aspect of mccains profile in courage is inaccurate or defunct
7105480 mccains top officials and fund raisers have past financial ties to nearly every domestic and foreign flashpoint from fannie mae to blackwater to ahmad chalabi to the government of georgia
7105481 most amazing among the principles of the republican way of war is dont waste much time and energy probing the enemys weaknesses
7105482 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7105483 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7105484 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7105485 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7105486 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7105487 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7105488 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7105489 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7105490 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7105491 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7105492 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7105493 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7105494 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7105495 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7105496 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7105497 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7105498 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7105499 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7105500 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7105501 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7105502 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7105503 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7105504 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7105505 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7105506 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7105507 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7105508 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7105509 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7105510 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7105511 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7105512 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7105513 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7105514 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7105515 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7105516 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7105517 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7105518 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7105519 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7105520 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7105521 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7105522 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7105523 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7105524 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7105525 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7105526 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7105527 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7105528 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7105529 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7105530 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7105531 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7105532 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7105533 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7105534 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7105535 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7105536 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7105537 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7105538 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7105539 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7105540 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7105541 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7105542 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7105543 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7105544 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7105545 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7105546 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7105547 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7105548 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7105549 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7105550 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7105551 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7105552 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7105553 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7105554 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7105555 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7105556 this is a planning took where all things are going
7105557 its just such an accomplishment for this team and the usa and these girls
7105558 theres no disappointment if we would have come out today and not fought id maybe have a different answer to that
7105559 i cant explain to you where our team was several months ago and where we are now from inside out how weve grown how weve played for each other
7105560 as the tournament went on the more i believed in us and where we could go and what we could do thats a tribute to all the girls
7105561 we wouldnt be here right now if not for logan
7105562 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7105563 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7105564 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7105565 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7105566 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7105567 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7105568 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7105569 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7105570 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7105571 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7105572 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7105573 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7105574 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7105575 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7105576 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7105577 russias state controlled media seemed extremely well prepared to cover the outbreak of armed conflict in georgia television networks immediately presented elaborate graphics with news anchors and commentators appearing to stick to disciplined talking points accusing georgian president mikheil saakashvili of aggression and the georgian armed forces of genocide and ethnic cleansing
7105578 at the hotel we discovered that there were already 48 russian journalists there together with us there were 50 people
7105579 i was the only one representing a foreign news agency the rest were from russian media and they arrived three days before we did as if they knew that something was going to happen earlier at the border crossing we met one man who was taking his wife and children from tskhinvali

7105589 our constitution provides for equality which includes special help and care for the oppressed and weaker sections who have been historically downtrodden the sc st communities in our opinion are also equal citizens and are entitled to a life of dignity in view of article 21 of the constitution as interpreted by this court
7105590 in the age of democracy no people and no community should be treated as being inferior however the truth is that in many parts of our country persons belonging to the sc st are oppressed humiliated and insulted this is a disgrace to our country
7105591 the caste system is a curse on our nation and the sooner it is destroyed the better in fact it is dividing our country at a time when we must all be united as indians if we wish to face the gigantic problems confronting us poverty unemployment price rise corruption etc the 1989 act is a salutary legislative measure in that direction
7105592 in this connection it may be mentioned that in america to use the word nigger today for an african american is regarded as highly offensive and is totally unacceptable even if it was acceptable 50 years ago
7105593 in our opinion calling a member of the scheduled caste chamar with intent to insult or humiliate him in a place within public view is certainly an offence under section 3 1 x of the act whether there was intent to insult or humiliate a person by using the word chamar will of course depend on the context in which it was used
7105594 in a country like ours with so much diversity so many religions castes ethnic and lingual groups etc all communities and groups must be treated with respect and no one should be looked down upon as inferior that is the only way we can keep our country united

7105627 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7105628 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7105629 barack elegeu o senador joe biden para ser nosso vice presidente

7105726 we noticed that he played under control and was mobile for a kid his size
7105727 that intrigued us when you are picking 22nd you dont know what to expect but terry bangen director of player personnel had a good interview with zach and his dad before the draft
7105728 i think going to a private school being an honor student and being a pianist might have scared some people off
7105729 to even get drafted is an honor and getting drafted by the americans in the first round is even better
7105730 this is a good organization and im happy to be here the owners are players and they know what players want and need to have the weight room is amazing and the dressing room is crazy
7105731 i talked to my parents and we agreed that the whl provides the best player development and the scholarship is nice
7105732 i put my kids in hockey when they were 2 years old
7105733 i think we should move them forward to realize their dreams and for the organization to plan for the future we had zach in piano and now that hes finished with piano the next stage is hockey
7105734 after hockey if he makes it as a professional thats good if not its on to university being in the whl you have university paid for what more could you ask you always have time to study but once your hockey time has passed its finished we are fully committed to give him the opportunity
7105735 you have to be careful with the 15 year olds it can be overwhelming
7105736 hes quiet and soft spoken but hes mature and his physical stature helps
7105737 he loves to rush the puck and that is something we like them to develop
7105738 the game is developing to another level as weve seen the last two years and having a defenseman whos able to bring the puck up ice is valuable
7105739 to come here and learn meet teammates and make friends this is a positive environment

7105743 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7105744 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7105745 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7105746 if you can have other employers pay the health insurance it is a cost benefit to the town
7105747 im comfortable with our position and i certainly understand the retirees position trying to preserve what they have
7105748 basically it comes down to 26 retired police officers who had a certain insurance benefit that was taken away from us
7105749 our group as well would like to resolve the issue but not if the solution is to continue to harm retired police officers who really worked some 30 years 25 years with the belief that the benefits were going to stick with them
7105750 not only is it a legal obligation its a moral obligation
7105751 the defendants policy is to insure that retirees have no loss in coverage
7105752 it is not the defendants policy however to force taxpayers to subsidize a small minority of retirees seeking to maximize their golden years
7105753 the disease has affected my family in a multitude of ways directly and indirectly
7105754 i have an aunt who had it when her daughter was 12
7105755 i have never been so touched by anything in my life
7105756 when i was first diagnosed i thought it was a death sentence you go through hell do what your doctor says and keep trying its a constant battle that i fight all the time you have to have a positive attitude and be thankful for the tiniest things i do something every day for me even if its tiny like having a cup of coffee
7105757 so many times when people hear the word cancer they are so frightened they had rather have a heart attack than cancer but theres so much out there now i was in stage 3 and it was in 12 of my 18 lymph nodes you have to have faith and believe youll get through it rejoice in each day ive met a lot of people who were diagnosed some make it and some dont i dont know why some people survive and some dont i almost died i fooled them
7105758 i take meds by mouth now and examine myself and keep going
7105759 im not anyone to honor this is for all who have breast cancer

7105762 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7105763 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7105764 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7105765 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7105766 the youth involvement is a major threat when you compare us to the democrats
7105767 we need better education on why our policies are better
7105768 i believe in finding common ground with those whom we dont always agree with and i will represent all of bay county
7105769 i told them that when you speak about sen barack obama you have to avoid personal attacks on him or his wife otherwise it will hurt mccain

7105773 i know everyone has their own life in the community but we need some help
7105774 to go from a four bedroom house with tiairra her and me and some roommates to this nobody expects this to happen but this is cruel
7105775 the faith is deep in our soul if you dont know where to turn to you turn to god
7105776 you dont hand a parish over to a cultural group and two years later take it away from them

7105778 the government could have shut us down any time they wanted
7105779 we try to accumulate what is best with our culture with what is best in american culture

7105783 my family wants to keep vietnamese heritage in my life as i grow older
7105784 we are unique in a lot of ways considering how close knit we are
7105785 the best part is that we are all vietnamese so we all understand each other
7105786 because of our church vietnamese culture has spread around buffalo
7105787 opposition to bill c 484 and any legislation that would result in compromising access to the medical services required to terminate a pregnancy
7105788 by making it a crime to kill an unborn child bill c 484 opens the door to denying women the right to control their own bodies if the foetus has the status of a person the rights of the woman carrying it will suffer my approach is based on my belief that everyone regardless of sex has the right to control his or her own body
7105789 he never thought he would see the day when a black man was a candidate for president
7105790 how could one of our own kind do this how could success be so bitter
7105791 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind

7105793 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision
7105794 i dont think in press conferences we should discuss referees and things
7105795 but i think i deserved a couple of things that didnt come to me
7105796 1 that this is experimental software and it can and likely will destroy your computer take down your site at ning ruin your day and make you cry like a small child with frustration on a regular basis
7105797 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7105798 this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of taekwondo and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7105799 to me it was obvious he was unable to continue
7105800 i would have been devastated if they hadnt changed the decision

7105804 accountability and self reliance love of country working hard without making excuses treating your neighbor as youd like to be treated
7105805 her fear of black men who passed by her on the street
7105806 where decency and endurance and the pioneer spirit were joined at the hip with conformity and suspicion and the potential for unblinking cruelty
7105807 but that was the age difference and not that she was mean or anything
7105808 generally shunned the tent revival circuit preferring a straight backed form of methodism that valued reason over passion and temperance over both
7105809 blanched whenever someone mentioned the subject and hoped to carry the secret to her grave
7105810 would turn her head in profile to show off her beaked nose which along with a pair of jet black eyes was offered as proof of cherokee blood

7105813 black slicked back hair and his perpetual wise guy grin
7105814 gramps is probably too busy telling one of his jokes or arguing with toot their version of the hawaiian word
7105815 toot notices but shes polite enough to bite her lip and offer dessert her instincts warn her against making a scene
7105816 every morning she woke up at five a m and changed from the frowsy muu muus sic she wore around the apartment into a tailored suit and high heeled pumps
7105817 here you graduated from college so you should be able to figure out this file
7105818 i was young and just graduated and thought i could kill the world
7105819 she really put me straight she made a point of indicating that experience is equitable to going to college and she was right
7105820 never stopped dreaming of a house with a white picket fence days spent baking or playing bridge or volunteering at the local library
7105821 your grandfather and i just figured we should treat people decently bar
7105822 shes wise that way my grandmother suspicious of overwrought sentiments or overblown claims content with common sense
7105823 before you came in she told me the fella was black thats the real reason why shes bothered
7105824 never had they given me reason to doubt their love i doubted if they ever would
7105825 and yet i knew that men who might easily have been my brothers could still inspire their rawest fears
7105826 than i can my white grandmother a woman who helped raise me a woman who sacrificed again and again for me a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe
7105827 she was really a very liberal person liberal in politics and i think liberal in thinking
7105828 frankly that story when it was in the book i felt didnt need to be in there
7105829 from our grandmother he gets his pragmatism his levelheadedness his ability to stay centered in the eye of the storm
7105830 i used to think i dont know whos the supervisor here me or her
7105831 when stanley was still alive they would go on cruises around the islands and theyd do nothing but play bridge

7105837 i now know from the many accounts that she has been to places in karnataka andhra pradesh maharashtra gujarat uttar pradesh and delhi in the past few months
7105838 but every time it is only i who has had to verify and fix her trail
7105839 the court had ordered the ssps of agra and chandigarh to present their reports by july 14 but no one came
7105840 india is not a signatory to the hague convention on international child abduction therefore despite indian courts showing sensitivity to the child and repeatedly upholding the judgment of foreign courts it does not preclude india from becoming a haven for pio and nri parents without custodian rights

7105894 but it was almost too much to bear at the same time
7105895 now well find out what this team is all about
7105896 they talked to the league and weve got to finish the game i dont necessarily agree with that but thats whats got to happen in that light weve got to be professional theres two things we can do for reggie now pray for him and play for him lets do that
7105897 each room contains a modern foldaway bed a table and a television screen that allows guests not only to watch tv but also use the internet or order food for instance each room has a spacious and luxurious modern bathroom
7105898 an important feast for all of the netherlands where tolerance towards homosexual men lesbian women bisexuals and transgenders appears to be under some pressure
7105899 they will be encouraged by dozens of youngsters who are not venturesome enough to join in from the boat about sixteen parents will be on board wearing t shirts with the text proud parent
7105900 to show the entire country that there are young homosexuals who are completely normal boys and girls
7105901 why there are young people who sometimes know this as young as eleven but who are denied the right to be happy and to shape their own identity
7105902 they need to have more meeting places it is important that they can meet gay peers
7105903 they might end up getting involved with people who are much older than they are people in their mid twenties and up that should be prevented
7105904 an exhibitionist gay parade has nothing to do with the emancipation of gay rights anyhow
7105905 wanted to participate in the biggest gay event of the year already for many years
7105906 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7105907 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7105908 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7105909 the politicians told us we want a subway were prepared to pay for it and accept some disruption but the one thing we absolutely dont want is any damage to the city
7105910 we need a system so that if things dont go as expected we dont find out after the damage is irreparable
7105911 we now know that whole segments of the city move by themselves a number of millimeters over the course of a season
7105912 its so much fun its better than in cologne paris or anywhere else
7105913 i think its a great opportunity to promote tolerance and anti discrimination
7105914 gay people still can be beaten up just like that for holding hands or being in the wrong place at the wrong time
7105915 its a change and it comes from the non natives
7105916 its getting worse i hope it will get better and i think it will in maybe 20 years but not in 10
7105917 any violent crime is prioritized but we believe attacks based on race religion or sexual orientation are worse
7105918 people in the netherlands think this is not a problem here anymore
7105919 we have 7 kinds on the menu most of them are the softer kind
7105920 we usually have kind of a conversation with customers to ask them what they are used to and ask what they expect
7105921 they really shouldnt use mushrooms because that can trigger psychosis
7105922 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7105923 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7105924 continuous and brazen disrespect toward this court and his own clients mr bergs actions are an enormous waste of judicial time and resources that this court cannot in good conscience allow to go unpunished
7105925 so thats where all the billions went after first being stowed away in the
7105926 unless other languages are not good enough why would she be offended by hearing the anthem in any
7105927 this is my armor and i have not sold it nor given it away
7105928 what have you to say about what the am r of the believers claims
7105929 it is my armor although i do not regard the am r of the believers to be a liar
7105930 o am r of the believers do you have any proof of ownership
7105931 as for me i testify that this is the judgment of the prophets the am r of the believers himself takes me to his judge and the judge rules against him i bear witness that there is no deity deserving worship but all h and i bear witness that muhammad is the messenger of all h by all h the armor is yours o am r of the believers i followed the army when you were on your way to the battle of siff n and the armor came out of your equipment
7105932 if you have accepted isl m the armor is yours
7105933 i was later informed by those who saw this man that he fought the khaw rij alongside al at the battle of nahraw n
7105934 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7105935 or some other incredibly fortunate company will scoop me up
7105936 try to see things from the clients point of view
7105937 mensen moeten weer uitgedaagd worden om naar hun innerlijke stem te luisteren en het proces daartoe kan goed door het schrijven in dagboekvorm
7105938 steeds vaker luisteren we naar de stem van de wereld en minder naar onszelf
7105939 beelden en geluiden komen ongevraagd bij ons binnen en dat leidt af van onze innerlijke stem ik besloot op een gegeven moment die niet meer te willen en ik wil anderen laten ervaren hoe het is om weer te luisteren naar wat je zelf wilt voelt en denkt deze cursus is niet productgericht maar procesgericht
7105940 maar er zijn zoveel momenten waarin je zou kunnen schrijven bijvoorbeeld als je ergens zit te wachten en wat is er dan gemakkelijker dan pen en papier te voorschijn te halen
7105941 het is goed om gedachten die je invallen direct te noteren en niet uit te stellen tot je bijvoorbeeld thuis bent want dan zijn er alweer zoveel andere gedachten en indrukken aan je voorbij gegaan je hoeft zeker geen schrijftalent te zijn om de cursus te kunnen volgen want het gaat om het proces dat jij doormaakt om jouw waarheid te volgen en op te schrijven
7105942 mensen zijn aanvankelijk altijd geneigd om na te denken waardoor wat op papier komt perfect moet zijn ik leer hen dat af en leer de mensen te gaan schrijven vanuit het hier en nu en om door te schrijven zonder het proces te onderbreken en terug te lezen of te verbeteren
7105943 ik heb steeds nieuwe inspriatie het is stimulerend om met elkaar te schrijven
7105944 maar door deze cursus leer je wel wat jij belangrijk vindt in je leven en om dat te verwoorden dat kan tijdens een solliciatie of als aanvulling op een therapie goed werken
7105945 can we take one more vacation this summer and if not where are we going next year

7105947 that could be an interesting topic but let me ask you a question first a horse a cow and a deer all eat grass the same stuff yet a deer excretes little pellets while a cow turns out a flat patty and a horse produces clumps of dried grass why do you suppose that is

7106006 one of the most challenging economic and policy environments in memory
7106007 by cushioning the first round economic impact of the financial stress we hoped also to minimize the risks of a so called adverse feedback loop in which economic weakness exacerbates financial stress which in turn further damages economic prospects
7106008 has been conditioned on our expectation that the prices of oil and other commodities would ultimately stabilize in part as the result of slowing global growth
7106009 intended to mitigate what have been at times very severe strains in short term funding markets and by providing an additional source of financing to allow banks and other financial institutions to de leverage in a more orderly manner
7106010 was severely complicated by the lack of a clear statutory framework
7106011 a statutory resolution regime for nonbanks besides reducing uncertainty would also limit moral hazard by allowing the government to resolve failing firms in a way that is orderly but also wipes out equity holders and haircuts some creditors analogous to what happens when a commercial bank fails
7106012 its absolutely an aspect of the idea the cost for shooting outside the u s can be considerably less and you can get high production value and find tremendous talent
7106013 the big trend in conversations in the u s right now is the idea of co commissioning
7106014 for the right project it would make sense because every market is facing the same thing the u s is facing
7106015 despite the earthquake that is going on in the record industry this band is still relevant we worked through our problems and now weve gone to work capturing our musical essence weve challenged ourselves were hungry
7106016 we understand the importance of staying relevant we understand the importance of playing new songs we understand how important it is not to become a nostalgia act no one in the band wants us to be that metallica still has something to offer no matter what the public thinks as a band we will do what we have to do we always have
7106017 i can honestly say that this album is the best album we could possibly have made can i guarantee that people will like it as much as they like our older albums no i cant i cant offer any guarantees but i promise you that we could not have made a better album
7106018 this album is some of the best music weve made in the past 15 years a lot of the albums we made post black album were us trying to get away from a perceived metallica sound that was the right thing for us at the time but we dont feel we haveto do that anymore and to be truthful its fun to play fast to be heavy were now all on the same page with regards to that id even go so far as to say that we even missed playing that way
7106019 this album has a hunger and a youthfulness about it we had a new producer a new bass player and we worked
7106020 i think were all aware of the danger of becoming a band that exists in the past i think any band thats been around as long as we have has to face that but

7106140 to steal ideas from one person is plagiarism to steal from many is research

7106156 it looks as if the high stakes poker game is now coming to an end and pakistani politics is going to be in a period of turmoil again
7106157 is going to probably take some time and may in fact be the final straw that breaks this coalitions back
7106158 it looks as if the high stakes poker game is now coming to an end and pakistani politics is going to be in a period of turmoil again because quite clearly the coalition is now going to split apart at the seams
7106159 he zardari will have to strengthen his base he will have to form new alliances and form new coalition partners including perhaps with the former party of president musharraf
7106160 the attorney general is clearly concerned that the mayors legal team has begun to seriously hurt his credibility as it relates to this case and is worried his time as political grandstander may be waning
7106161 this so called offer was made by someone who has no authority to request such a thing and was done purely to score points in front of the cameras

7106182 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7106183 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7106184 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7106185 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7106186 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7106187 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7106188 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7106189 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7106190 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7106191 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7106192 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7106193 it is going to be a very emotional time for me
7106194 living in the south i never thought i would see the day
7106195 some people have a vision of tennessee as one of the racist places
7106196 verbal dissent should be placed in the appropriate place in the baggage before we leave
7106197 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7106198 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7106199 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7106200 we the people are responsible and accountable for what does or does not happen in washington and the fact is is too many american families are following the bad example of the federal government theyre spending more money than they make theyre charging their credit cards taking out home equity loans mortgaging their future
7106201 i work as the first point of contact for all the delegates all the vips
7106202 a lot of the preparation was working for the democratic party and working in different capacities in different campaigns
7106203 it was over for me before it ever really got started
7106204 the bottom line is that iowa is a grassroots state and its in the rural areas where the roots are deepest
7106205 its the question of what did you do in the war daddy
7106206 now the trumpet summons us again not as a call to bear arms though arms we need not as a call to battle though embattled we are but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle
7106207 surprised the hell out my staff it surprised the hell out of me
7106208 how did we ever allow the republican right to take the high ground on values
7106209 we democrats arent fighting back we dont fight back on the values front i cant wait to debate rudy giuliani i mean come on man
7106210 i like what he has to say about values its about time we start fighting back
7106211 joe we have a problem down here theyre saying youre a catholic
7106212 kids keep a thought in their heads for 12 hours
7106213 its a beautiful life that takes work as a dad he rebuilt this family
7106214 i was a 42 year old guy who never really when i started off intended to really run quite frankly i thought more about how to win than how to govern i wasnt nearly as sure as what i wanted to do if i were able to govern today it is almost the opposite unfortunately
7106215 this time rightly or wrongly i am given a fair amount of credit by serious press guys for being ready to be president but theres grave doubt whether i can get the nomination to run for president so its kind of a flip do you know what i mean
7106216 its sort of been liberating i dont feel constrained in this campaign i dont parse my words i dont look at the polls im going to win or lose on my own terms one of the things that last time taught me was the worst way to lose was on somebody elses terms
7106217 they literally had to take the top of my head off twice
7106218 every time i hear i am more and more convinced hes the guy i want in the white house
7106219 theyve convinced themselves that you dont even know whats best for your own members theyve drugged the kool aid
7106220 there would be no middle class in american without the union movement
7106221 i dont expect government to solve my problems but i expect it to understand my problems
7106222 plagiarism give me a break i was chair of clinton gore in 92 and we were dealing with gennifer flowers
7106223 they stuck with me when i was being called a lying no good so and so how could i not and i really did not want to go back to sioux city
7106224 when you give up that principle youre just yielding to selfishness the people who got me through are the people who stayed loyal to me
7106225 is how do i survive this i think you are blinded by your despair its kind of like youre getting sucked inside yourself into a black hole except what you really need sometimes you just need to know someone else made it
7106226 i didnt know them i had never met them in my life
7106227 but you know when you have sort of a gift the gift is you survived you know if you give that to somebody it makes you feel worthwhile because people did it for me
7106228 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7106229 last ditch effort to help save the planet from irrevocable change
7106230 republican always always campaign by protraying the democratic candidate as an out of touch elitist
7106231 democrats in general and obama in particular have trouble connecting with working class voters
7106232 mccain s a graduate of annapolis i know a lot of the annapolis breed remember i m west point where i was born my father went there
7106233 so the obama campaign is going all out on the issue of mccain s multiple houses isn t that kind of stupid
7106234 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7106235 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7106236 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7106237 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7106238 stole the marginal votes gore may have needed to clearly carry florida and the election
7106239 they dont want to look themselves in the mirror for betraying their finest progressive traditions and so they have to lash out at someone
7106240 theyre not going to blame themselves for selling out again and again and again
7106241 they make mistake after mistake after mistake because theyve lost their self respect they dont know who they are anymore theyve lost their identity
7106242 theyre basically appealing to the public by saying do you know how bad the republicans are people say they dont think that much of the democratic party but do you know how bad the republicans are if you define yourself by the worst instead of the best you can be theres something wrong with your psychological makeup as a party
7106243 gore is to the right of bradley on almost every important issue
7106244 he had at various times in his political career been a neoliberal tough on crime and communism a new agey environmentalist and techno futurist and an old fashioned bible thumping populist gores response to problems said a long time aide was to consult five pollsters
7106245 thats basically trying to be like the republicans but not quite like the republicans and still have a democratic image
7106246 gore advisers say naders appeal will dim as the election draws closer
7106247 theyre also counting on reform party candidate pat buchanan to nab would be bush votes
7106248 yeah what they should have said is hey the green party is for this this and this
7106249 its not my job to elect al gore or george bush
7106250 i think its an ego trip and people have lost sight of what the goals are
7106251 why didnt the democrats stop bush on iraq why did they surrender their declaration of war powers authority under the constitution and send it up pennsylvania avenue to the white house
7106252 it got so bad that everything bush did i was blamed for until i ended up saying gee i know someone who should share the blame with me barbara and george bush
7106253 they created him why dont you go back to the origins
7106254 he had called me and i think reached out to my campaign my sense is that mr nader is somebody who if you dont listen and adopt all of his policies thinks youre not substantive he seems to have a pretty high opinion of his own work
7106255 ralph nader is trying to get attention he has become the perennial political candidate
7106256 i think its a shame because if you look at his legacy in terms of consumer protections its an extraordinary one but at this point hes somebody whos trying to get attention and his campaign hasnt gotten any traction
7106257 when i saw him at a book signing last year in a downtown bookstore i stood in line with 300 people
7106258 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7106259 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7106260 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7106261 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7106262 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7106263 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7106264 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7106265 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7106266 because of possible first amendment violations requests for reporters phone records are supposed to receive an even higher level scrutiny before they can be approved usually requiring the approval of the attorney general or other high ranking justice department officials
7106267 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7106268 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7106269 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7106270 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7106271 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7106272 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7106273 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7106274 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7106275 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7106276 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7106277 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7106278 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7106279 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7106280 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7106281 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7106282 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7106283 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7106284 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7106285 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7106286 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7106287 they help define our identity switzerland without borders would no longer be switzerland
7106288 it is part and parcel of the swiss system that citizens can interfere in the political process launching referendums against controversial decisions
7106289 the expatriates clearly expressed their willingness to keep close ties with switzerland and to contribute their experience as citizens
7106290 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7106291 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7106292 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7106293 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7106294 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7106295 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7106296 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7106297 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7106298 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7106299 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
7106300 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
7106301 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
7106302 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7106303 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7106304 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7106305 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7106306 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7106307 this is about shifting the power back to the people
7106308 why in the world couldnt we have landslided this bumbling governor from texas with the terrible record
7106309 hey the green party is for this this and this did you know that the democratic party is also for this this and this why should you vote for the green party vote for us
7106310 oh now were going to have a lean and mean military budget
7106311 how do you think they are on the redirections of the country that people care about
7106312 you know they have half the market wed better look like them
7106313 what are you doing competing dont you know its a two party game a two major party game what are you doing competing
7106314 now you only have two on the ballot to choose from
7106315 gee you know what was kerrys excuse why didnt he win
7106316 gee i know someone who should share the blame with me
7106317 barbara and george bush they created him why dont you go back to the origins why dont you go back to ann richards who could have easily defeated him when he ran
7106318 oh i see so hes doing all this to win the election and then hell be different
7106319 well lets start with my disagreeing with barack obama disagreeing with himself
7106320 if i had my way and if i could single payer but i cant unilaterally so ill do this
7106321 oh well you know the republicans are filibustering or something
7106322 oh weve got more important things we have to do
7106323 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7106324 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7106325 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7106326 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7106327 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7106328 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7106329 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7106330 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7106331 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7106332 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7106333 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7106334 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7106335 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7106336 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7106337 to resign on the day of the service for walter lippmann
7106338 he seemed perfectly decent and reasonable during the negotiations it has been a disquieting experience for me it has really made me lose my faith in my judgment of people
7106339 peretz used to look like a jewish psychoanalyst now he looks like a jewish used car salesman page 783
7106340 when i first heard that he was after the new republic i wrote gil saying that if he ever got hold of it he would destroy it
7106341 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7106342 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7106343 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7106344 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7106345 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7106346 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7106347 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7106348 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7106349 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7106350 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7106351 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7106352 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7106353 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7106354 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7106355 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7106356 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7106357 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7106358 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7106359 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7106360 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7106361 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7106362 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7106363 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7106364 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7106365 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7106366 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7106367 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7106368 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7106369 easily the best energy plan ever put forward by a nominee of either party
7106370 on 68 million acres of land over 40 million offshore which oil companies are not drilling on
7106371 obama will require oil companies to diligently develop these leases or turn them over so that another company can develop them
7106372 at least 60 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2030
7106373 instruct doe to enter into public private partnerships to develop five first of a kind commercial scale coal fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration
7106374 move quickly to commercialize and deploy low carbon coal technology
7106375 this is an aggressive achievable and most important of all a necessary energy plan kudos to senator obama and his energy team maybe he is the one
7106376 let me be clear there is no question that obamas energy plan is better than mccains and a very big improvement over bush but i am convinced by my close reading of his energy plan that it is essential that efforts like the 1sky campaign need to keep ramping up the pressure for a truly science based program to deal with the climate crisis we have an extremely short time frame in which to do so obama and mccain needs to be pushed now and pushed if he is elected to revise a number of elements of his program
7106377 we need to look at completely changing how we live how we generate revenue how we provide food and clothing for ourselves etc etc etc
7106378 i think it helps but it doesnt guarantee hes going to win the state
7106379 it may be more useful that evan bayh is on the ticket in other parts of the country he may be more useful in an area like florida
7106380 youre picking somebody from next door youre picking somebody from the midwest who presumably has different values than you
7106381 if evan bayh does become vice president of the united states it leaves an opening at junior senator from indiana its an opening that according to state law the governor gets the opportunity to fill
7106382 to argue that putting bayh on the ticket automatically gives obama indiana is incorrect
7106383 i think it makes it more competitive i still think mccain would have a good chance of winning
7106384 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7106385 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7106386 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7106387 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7106388 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7106389 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7106390 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7106391 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7106392 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7106393 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7106394 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7106395 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7106396 you will not have a unanimous vote at the convention that much i can tell you
7106397 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
7106398 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
7106399 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
7106400 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
7106401 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
7106402 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7106403 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7106404 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7106405 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7106406 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7106407 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7106408 detached alaskans promoting an unusual mixture of emotion and a smattering of science within the context of a scrambled worldview
7106409 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7106410 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7106411 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7106412 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7106413 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7106414 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7106415 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7106416 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7106417 a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7106418 we havent used a drop of gasoline in a month and a half two months
7106419 going through the generator is 4 2 gallons a day every work day
7106420 it cost seven or eight dollars when i first started now it costs 32 a can
7106421 this is not new technology we just stumbled onto one spot where its working and working really well
7106422 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7106423 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7106424 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7106425 trust me i have the inside dope that obvious thing that everyone already knows is true
7106426 i cant believe i actually miss jonah goldberg in tnr
7106427 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7106428 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7106429 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7106430 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7106431 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7106432 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7106433 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7106434 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7106435 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7106436 en liten balkong med stor charm och som godis f r gat
7106437 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
7106438 if money is no object were very close to having no technological obstacles to providing the electricity from solar and wind sources
7106439 if money is an object the 10 year timeline is not realistic
7106440 well be much more able to make solar reasonably close in cost to current generators of electricity if you take into account the lifetime of the system and no fuel charges
7106441 the cost of not trying to reach gores goal will be even greater than seeking to accomplish it
7106442 its going to be a challenge given the limited funding and time
7106443 would deal a devastating blow to the u s renewable energy industry just as it is beginning to take off
7106444 the tax credits are needed to make the projects pan out tep is very supportive of the extension
7106445 how after a lifetime of work he could have lost it all because of a butterfly ballot that didnt align while his friend the executive sitting across from him with the condescending smile could afford to come in second in his business year after year maybe see his companys stock tumble and yet still be considered successful
7106446 unless they are cut off in midstream at a happy juncture end in failure
7106447 hang on one goldurned minute this aint gold at all its just gold coloured
7106448 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
7106449 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
7106450 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
7106451 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
7106452 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
7106453 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7106454 coming from california ive never been anywhere like this before
7106455 i was trying my best but i dont think they believed me when i told them i was taking a trip to the woods
7106456 its really nice up here and its something that i know none of them have ever seen before but after growing up in the city i dont think they can believe that im out here
7106457 this is my second year but i dont think you ever really know what youre getting into
7106458 you have an idea but once you get up here and actually get involved with the communities you get a better perspective on the lifestyle the needs and the difference you can make
7106459 it took me awhile to realize where i was its like something i would see on tv when im sitting at home on my couch so it was a real culture shock to me absolutely shocking with a capital a but the kids are real energetic and they like to run around like me so im having a great time they have a lot out here and theyre giving a lot so there are plenty of positives for them to take away from this week
7106460 stone this morning im going to share two new video interviews ive found the first is an interview with zachary quinto from comic con in which he talks about his role as spock in the upcoming star funks corner professional wrestling is it real
7106461 obok w miar dobrego poziomu sygna u s bardzo g bokie zaniki
7106462 ill use nulls if it makes sense to use nulls
7106463 this being an election year were the only party that matters were holding our convention this evening right here
7106464 hey double bubble so like who lies more chicas or muchachos guacamole in my chooz
7106465 we will not have many entertainers of the same caliber as mr mcgraw
7106466 we just wanted to kick it off with some flair
7106467 mystic is looked at more historically vs were probably more current acts the major difference being a tony bennett as compared to tim mcgraw
7106468 hur kan du vara r dd f r s nt som r typ 100 ggr mindre n dig sj lv
7106469 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7106470 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7106471 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7106472 today i sewed up the hands of a prisoner hands cut up by barbed wire he thanked me and that felt good
7106473 i cant believe they would be so stupid its just provocative
7106474 but maybe their intention is to get rid of all the former liberal governments tomorrow starts today programs
7106475 spends 3 5 billion on arts funding and is spending more on arts than did the previous liberal government in the case of promart we think the funding choices made were inappropriate inappropriate because they were ideological in some cases with highly ideological individuals exposing their agendas or money going to wealthy celebrities or fringe arts groups that in many cases would be at best unrepresentative and at worst offensive
7106476 if they are spending more its in adjusted for inflation dollars this is about some right wing troglodytes in the party overcome with self righteous indignation that people like toronto broadcast journalist avi lewis received funding
7106477 would we not love to get that from our stock portfolios if these cuts will save the countrys economy god help us were in worse shape than i ever thought
7106478 a window into the machiavellian political tactics of killing a small but crucial government program
7106479 the government knows that if the story is framed honestly there will be little support for killing the program and so in the middle of a summer when canadians are having trouble paying for gas they find a few examples of grant recipients that will enrage their conservative base and use that as a political rationale for doing something that would otherwise hurt them politically now theyve succeeded in framing the story in terms of who deserves public funding rather than who supports it and that is cynical in the extreme
7106480 think this it too slow or this isnt funny or somethings gone wrong
7106481 oh man why did i commit an hour and ten bucks to this friggin show
7106482 im glad i took a chance to go and see something philosophical and smart and maybe a little bit funny

7106503 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7106504 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7106505 this is the first massive effort in the political world

7106507 were not allowed to kill off fair use so you must all be pirates
7106508 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7106509 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7106510 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7106511 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency

7106525 jeder wusste dass der verbrauch zum problem werden k nnte ich rede da nicht nur von mir selbst sondern auch von ein paar anderen fahrern man h tte doch das rennen von 34 auf 32 runden verk rzen k nnen wir sind ein perfektes rennen gefahren ich habe nicht nur den sieg verloren sondern auch den punkt f r die schnellste runde
7106526 ich bin ma los entt uscht von den gp2 leuten was die l nge des rennens angeht man h tte einfach um eine runde verk rzen m ssen
7106527 die regeln erlauben nicht dass wir w hrend des rennens nachtanken wir haben alles versucht um den verbrauch zu verringern aber wir waren machtlos das ist schade weil wir so elf wertvolle punkte verloren haben
7106528 ich hatte keine vorwarnung denn wenn der motor gestottert h tte h tte ich rollen lassen k nnen mein vorsprung nach hinten war ja gro genug
7106529 aber es war ganz pl tzlich aus ich bin nicht allzu entt uscht denn giorgio und ich hatten das gleiche problem damit bleibt das titelrennen weit offen und ich bin zuversichtlich dass ich morgen ein gutes resultat holen kann das wird vom neunten startplatz harte arbeit aber es ist m glich
7106530 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7106531 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7106532 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7106533 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7106534 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7106535 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong

7106538 barbarians thats what they are they kill innocent people here how many kilometers miles outside the battlefield they bombed all over georgia
7106539 its hard to be in your own city and see someone elses soldiers roaming your streets i didnt sleep for 15 days
7106540 were trying to make things normal again but normalcy will only come when peoples souls are eased
7106541 i took only a foot and some of a torso i couldnt get the other bodies out
7106542 im an old man but i will return to abkhazia
7106543 russian georgians ossetians we should all be living in peace together like we did under stalin
7106544 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7106545 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7106546 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7106547 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7106548 we dont send a message to anyone who hasnt initiated contact with the campaign and opted in
7106549 was just as sweet coming back up and it was going down
7106550 ampara la aplicaci n de una sanci n muy grave por rgano administrativo sin que medie ning n otro procedimiento
7106551 habr que determinar entonces hasta qu punto una disposici n de ese tenor no agrede las normas del debido proceso
7106552 nadie podr ser castigado por un hecho que no estuviere expresamente previsto por la ley amp
7106553 es claro entonces que no hay delito sin ley penal y tan importante como esto por aplicaci n elemental del principio de separaci n de poderes es al poder judicial y no un rgano administrativo a quien le compete determinar la existencia o no de un delito
7106554 es interesante que el diputado que est encargado de la relator a del caso jorge orrico sea un diputado del frente amplio de uruguay que tiene cierta identificaci n con el chavismo
7106555 sabemos que eso en venezuela no va a ocurrir pero la comisi n tiene la posibilidad de elevar el caso ante la comisi n interamericana de los derechos humanos
7106556 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7106557 how can you be a leader of anything if you cant be a leader of your home
7106558 i walk the streets and people say please run as a write in

7106561 teaser trailer it is nearly identical to the french version we saw way back in early june
7106562 i knew i was stronger i knew i could do it
7106563 the relay is a team sport im not using that for redemption at all
7106564 were a team out here in the relay and thats what we came out here to do which was to run as a team
7106565 redemption that comes at other meets when i run the open it does not come when i have three other guys on the team
7106566 when we drop the baton in back to back relay races the public views our performance as a disaster
7106567 i have received e mails from people across the country particularly about the relays they all say more or less the same thing the dropped batons were reflective of a lack of preparation lack of professionalism and of leadership i agree
7106568 if i had carried the momentum id had through all the way from the trials i would have been fine
7106569 this was not my performance i wanted to do better next time
7106570 i will not rest until i get something for the united states again
7106571 we can be a much better team and we will be
7106572 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7106573 figure out which of the kitchen tables to sit at
7106574 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7106575 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7106576 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7106577 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7106578 a mon avis cette m re de famille ne compte pas faire du

7106583 were 0 3 in the preseason but were still 0 0
7106584 regardless of whos out there its up to us to execute and do our own job it may come out where we may have to be without tom
7106585 we only have another week before we get started but we take a lot of pride in our special teams unit
7106586 theres just no way we can have returns going back on us putting our defence in a tough situation and putting our team in a tough situation
7106587 well get better well watch film and well get better
7106588 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
7106589 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
7106590 earlier in the day anna had a dispute with gajanan mahajan over some trivial issue he received third degree burns
7106591 talks have been positive final draft has been sent to the government waiting for their response hopefully they should accept our demand we want land for the period of the yatra and for years to come
7106592 the pakistani government and the military in particular are not monolithic
7106593 in some areas theres very good counter terrorism cooperation with us in other areas there is plenty of room for improvement there are elements within the government and military that might have some links to militant groups in the region that is a matter of concern
7106594 we have not received any specific evidence of any military officer helping terrorists
7106595 if we are provided specific evidence we will take action
7106596 if there was any collaboration of any sort to help the militants you would not see these sorts of things against security officers
7106597 the pakistan army is very professional organization it is one of the best armies in the world
7106598 i was going to the worst place in the world and i didnt even know it yet weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river that snaked through the war like a main circuit cable plugged straight into kurtz it was no accident that i got to be the caretaker of colonel walter e kurtzs memory any more than being back in saigon was an accident there is no way to tell his story without telling my own and if his story really is a confession then so is mine
7106599 you know what women are like you send them out for kaka and they come back with most of barcelona a bayern left winger and a keeper from monaco too shell only play them all once then claim theyre out of fashion and bin them or sell them to hull anyway
7106600 but he needs a helping hand bless him who the hell rests gerrard for an away game at portsmouth
7106601 ignoring javier margas marco boogers rigobert song titi camara and david nugent harry redknapp has always had an eye for talent if he says shes good enough she could be just what we need shell show rafa how to spend money without wasting it on feckless french and spanish youngsters who arent even any good at carrying on the drinks i mean anthony le tallec why
7106602 id love to see jamie carragher sent to his room for bad language
7106603 as for this diving business well if the lads all came in with mud stains on their shirts im sure there would be hell to pay
7106604 i really enjoy that side of the job because that is real managing
7106605 the pumped up pair clinched and swapped spit at a celebratory bash outside the olympic village
7106606 this looks like something that could roll out nationally if the ticket takes it all the way
7106607 you have a tours button so you must have agents in addition to a website so you must make money as a brokerage probably splitting the commission since its partially on the web
7106608 the difference between a successful person and others is not a lack of strength not a lack of knowledge but rather a lack of will
7106609 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here and say look you gotta get this done
7106610 alberta became the bolivarian province of alberta when you decided to take more royalties from the oil companies
7106611 same as they were the earth kingdom is busy rebuilding with help from the water and fire nation everything will be back to normal there soon
7106612 hehe nothing its just funny you saying nice things it just seems so forced
7106613 yes well niceness wasnt something i experienced much of during the war concern and trust and all the emotions you throw around are well were considered a sign of weakness by my father and other soldiers you had to scare people into respecting you soldiers wouldnt respect someone who was weak let alone a weak female leader
7106614 well its a good thing youve changed i like the new azula
7106615 ill just let that slide but you really make it too easy avatar
7106616 you leave in a week youre to be transported to omashu by a fire nation ship next monday im sorry azula
7106617 oh well we both knew it was coming cant stop the inevitable i suppose
7106618 we arent havent been since the festival after ozais execution
7106619 what happened if you dont mind my asking that is
7106620 well she pulled me aside during the festival and started apologizing i couldnt really hear her because of the loud music so i was kind of lost but she started talking about zuko and how she was in love with him then she started apologizing again i was dumbfounded needless to say i just kind of said okay and walked away at first i was really angry at katara and zuko for stealing her from me but then i realized that love wasnt something you could force on someone it was their destiny so i just kind of accepted it i still try to avoid being around katara if i can but avoiding zuko was impossible seeing as how i have to mediate between the leaders of the nations eventually he apologized to me as well but i told him i didnt have any hard feelings me and him are actually kind of best friends funny how that works not long before he was hell bent on killing me haha
7106621 well this was nice as usual but ive got to go there are some rogue fire nation soldiers that have been causing a ruckus and ive gotta go teach them a lesson
7106622 of course ive actually got a little surprise for you
7106623 cmon get up princess time to go for a ride
7106624 so princess you ready to meet the same fate your father did
7106625 i asked you a question princess i expect an answer
7106626 you know boys weve still got some time before the ships due to leave what do ya say we have a little fun your looking rather attractive
7106627 besides i dont think the avatar would take too kindly to you hurting me before we reach our destination now would he
7106628 oh my god what the hell is that ahhh take that you freak
7106629 giving you your surprise of course i thought it was obvious
7106630 aang you cant just break me out of here did you even stop to think of the consequences
7106631 ugh they will come looking for me zuko might not but i know the leaders of the earth nation will we will only be delaying the inevitable
7106632 you worry too much azula im the avatar and youre the smart and cunning azula of the fire nation im sure well figure something out
7106633 well are you going to get these cuffs off me or not avatar
7106634 finally you have no idea how incredibly uncomfortable those things are
7106635 i dont mean to rush you but we kind of need to hurry before they wake back up
7106636 ahh it feels so good to be out of there the air was so foul
7106637 dont worry about it if it wasnt for you id still be on my way to my death so im forever grateful for what youve done how ever stupid it might have been
7106638 wheres that flying bison of yours i dont see him anywhere
7106639 oh i didnt bring him i didnt want to announce to the entire ship who i was figured itd be best if we didnt give away who broke you out if that were the case we really wouldnt have a chance
7106640 well i had to lets just say liberate an unused water nation sub the machinist had built a few more than we needed during the day of the black sun so i figured id take one for a spin maybe save a damsel in distress on the way
7106641 water bending of course all you gotta do is control the water around the ship and you can go up down however fast you want its pretty ingenious really
7106642 the first models has some problem storing air but the mechanist revised the construction a bit we can stay under for quiet awhile now
7106643 ahh yes he is the one that invented the war balloons correct
7106644 an island close by weve gotta find appa then from there the western air temple
7106645 well its sort of where i live now really i had to rebuild a bit of it of course sparky sparky boom man as sokka would say destroyed quiet a bit of it in his attempt to kill us but before that i thought it was really pretty its my favorite temple and i figure they all belong to me anyways seeing as how im the last air bender i might as well settle down at one of them
7106646 im sorry aang about your people and what the fire nation has done
7106647 dont worry about it you didnt kill us all off and besides im still here so that means hope isnt completely lost ill bring back the air benders somehow
7106648 and ill help you with whatever it is you do though not like i have much of a choice
7106649 i think we wont have much to worry about at the temple them you know finding you even if they suspect me of doing it they dont really know where i stay you should be safe i obviously wont be able to stay with you the whole time im still the avatar and if i vanished that would be extremely suspicious
7106650 god damn aang i almost killed you again can you give me a warning before you start blasting things to hell
7106651 sorry azula just had to get rid of the evidence wont happen again i promise
7106652 i know one thing i loved during my training to defeat ozai and all the running we did was the sights places like this really kept my spirits up when i was losing hope i fought for peoples lifes yes but another part of it was so all the pretty places id been too wouldnt end up in ash the fire nation was so destructive fire itself is a destructive force the misguided can cause and did cause so much damage with it
7106653 your right fire isnt the most forgiving of elements its angry if not properly controlled but at the same time it is a beautiful element and can be used for good in the right persons hands
7106654 mhmm very true beautiful and dangerous kind of like you
7106655 are you hungry i figure weve still got a little while before anyone starts actually looking for you and well im starving
7106656 we should leave soon we cant stay this close to long
7106657 how long do you think itll take to get there
7106658 well ive never really been fond of flying ive ridden in the war balloons before just wasnt my thing i guess you could say
7106659 toph was the same way well sort of she didnt like not being able to see you know she saw with her feet so in the air she felt pretty helpless but eventually she actually started to love riding appa so im sure you will as well
7106660 i told you youd like it those bulky balloons are nothing compared to a sky bison
7106661 do you ever miss katara i mean you say you avoid her do you miss seeing her
7106662 i guess in a way i do she was a great friend we were really close as well i could tell her anything and she would listen she was comforting and kind and truly a beautiful girl all these things are why i fell in love with her she was something else you know i couldnt help but not think about her not miss her miss us but shes with zuko now me and her were over i had my chance and i guess i failed im glad shes happy and ive forgiven her and zuko but still i cant help but feel jealousy when i see zuko even when i see sokka or toph i cant help but think of katara because we all journeyed together it makes me think about our time together the journey to defeat the fire lord all we went through i kind of fell into a depression at first after that night i left for awhile i didnt want to see my friends i didnt want any part of their sympathy i just wanted to forget about her and i knew theyd apologize and tell me things would be okay but they wouldnt she was mine and zuko took her from me thats all i could think about eventually i realized i was wrong and that he didnt take her but still it was devastating shortly after that was when i started visiting you actually im not even entirely sure why i did but im glad i did weve become great friends haha and now were convicts on the loose well you are anyways funny how things work destiny is a weird thing
7106663 a few landmarks and the fact that ive flown here so many times eventually you just kind of get a feel for where something is things start looking and smelling familiar like the air the air here is much more clean unlike that of the fire nations the fire nation smells like ash and sulfur if your close enough to one of the many volcanoes
7106664 this is where youll be staying while were here which could be for awhile
7106665 outside to be honest i find myself sleeping out there more often than in here anyways the nights here are incredibly beautiful and peaceful
7106666 make yourself at home ive gotta go back out for now though im sure by now they know of your escape and ive got to go see how serious they are about it i should be back sometime tomorrow im pretty sure youll be safe here till then
7106667 before you go i just wanted to say thanks for what youve done for me
7106668 it was no problem i mean besides the world wouldnt be the same without the queen of all cranky fire bending females
7106669 leave it to you to ruin a happy moment sigh you better leave before this cranky fire bender decides to burn you to a crisp
7106670 hey hey theres no need for that ill just be going now
7106671 well i ought to go see you soon appa yip yip
7106672 hey azula isnt this outfit sweet i feel like a ninja
7106673 aw come on now i thought it was pretty funny
7106674 well yeah actually haha you should have seen your face it was priceless
7106675 yeah maybe but if i was like you then wed have a serious problem with boredom i keep things exciting
7106676 ah pretty bad the earth nation is outraged they are accusing the fire nation of being weak not being able to hold onto one prisoner etc etc etc long story short they are sending a pretty massive search party of earth and fire benders to find you and on top of that a rogue band of ex fire nation soldiers have begun attacking small villages and outposts in the earth kingdom from the sounds of it they are a pretty big army saying something about the fire nation will return to power again or something to that effect citizens of the fire nation are starting to agree with the rogues and their cause their leader is quit charismatic zuko doesnt know what do the earth nation army is still pretty weak from the war but they are trying to hold them off as well as they can but my help is going to be needed they actually tried to recruit me in finding you but i told them i thought stopping an army was more important than going on a manhunt i tried to convince them of the same thing but they wouldnt have it its like they think their troubles will all end if your gone i dont get it
7106677 it seems things will never change its like people dont want peace i dont get it
7106678 everything will be fine you can defeat these rogues and when that happens the people of the fire nation will realize their beliefs are flawed and everything will fall back into place
7106679 itll all be fine youll fix everything im sure of it
7106680 but whats the point i dont even think its worth it after all ive done nothings changed people are still hurting other people and i think well i think thats how itll always be its like they get enjoyment out of the suffering of others even if i stop this war another ones sure to come eventually most of the avatars have had to deal with war what difference does it make if i try to stop this one or not another one will come its only a matter of time its a hopeless venture people are ignorant
7106681 sorry about that its just things are starting to get to me i guess im starting to realize the truth that there will always be bad people and nothing i can do will stop it just fighting one man cant change a hundred years of war and the people that took part in it and im just now realizing that but i have to be strong and fight for the people that cant fight back thats my job and ill do it without hesitation im going to stop them although i will need help even the avatar cant take on a battalion of elite troops by himself
7106682 youll be coming with me and i think i might pick up an old friend or two along the way
7106683 how exactly can i go theyll recognize me for sure
7106684 not if youre a ninja did you think i got this for me haha silly
7106685 theres no way your getting me to wear that hideous excuse for an outfit
7106686 aww your no fun do you honestly want to be cooped up here the rest of your life
7106687 ugh this better be worth it and if i get caught its your fault
7106688 well before we actually head out i think we should train a bit can you fire bend regular fire like you know not blue itll give you away and we dont want that
7106689 of course i can its just not as hot as the blue fire and well i go for whatevers the most powerful
7106690 well lets go a round or two i know you havent exactly been able to bend a lot during your prison time oh and you might not want to use your lightening either seeing as how your one of the only fire benders that can also a big give away
7106691 you have no idea how good it feels to bend again not being able too well its made me feel empty like im not myself its hard to explain
7106692 wow for someone who hasnt really bended in over a year your doing pretty good although i think your aim with lightening has faltered a bit
7106693 nope nope my mistake hah i dont feel like dying twice thanks
7106694 we can leave now if youd like the sooner the better we have to stop at gaoling and pick up toph then we can start our search for these bandits reports say they appear to be making camp somewhere in the earth kingdom which would make sense seeing as how the earth kingdom is all theyve attacked so far toph will most likely recognize you seeing as how she cant see with eyes you cant exactly disguise your stature and internal movements but i trust her i know she wouldnt tell anyone
7106695 im just going to go grab a few things from inside ill be right back
7106696 this should last us awhile we might want to get more in gaoling before we start the search though
7106697 we still have a couple hours why dont you take a nap or something
7106698 a minute at most im going to stear appa in the direction of that large group of fighters there
7106699 when we get over them were going to jump off and give them what they have coming
7106700 okay were getting close now get ready to jump on my mark
7106701 can we have this conversation after we arent getting viciously attacked
7106702 hey youre the avatar arent you youre the one that took down our leader youre going to die
7106703 we wish to finish what the fire nation started and we wont stop until all bow to the power of the fire nation
7106704 i suggest you answer him trust me when i say you dont want to see him angry
7106705 fine have it your way but trust me when i say your not going to like my partners interrogation techniques
7106706 oh and how is it you plan to subdue us as far as i can tell we still have you out numbered
7106707 thats the 2nd mistake youve made today never underestimate the avatar
7106708 couldnt have done it better myself aang you do me proud
7106709 oh dont worry about it hey you guys round these suckers up and put them in a holding cell until we can get around to interrogating them
7106710 you dont have to be so nervous im not going to turn you in or something
7106711 so i heard whatever attacked the ship made quick work of all the guards
7106712 now now aang lets not get to cocky the guards werent exactly the most experienced
7106713 of course we cant go and let you get a big head now can we
7106714 youre my type of gal not afraid to tell it how it is katara on the other hand she is way to gentle
7106715 speaking of katara have you seen her lately aang i havent heard anything from her in awhile
7106716 no although i think shes been busy helping zuko out with all the paperwork and things that go along with being the firelord apparently its pretty stressful
7106717 nope went away for awhile something to have to do with meeting with some other rich family i didnt really pay attention
7106718 nope after i returned and they learned about my help in the defeat of the fire nation they just kind of figured i could take care of myself which i can so im pretty happy here now
7106719 aang you do realize this is pretty serious right what you did
7106720 yeah i know but i had too shes a really good friend now and shes changed i wasnt about to let her die
7106721 yes i know im extremely grateful for what he did for me
7106722 oh nothing so what brings you to these parts aang
7106723 well as youve obviously seen ex fire nation soldiers are attacking earth nation cities and are gaining more and more support in the fire nation each day if we dont put a stop to it their could be revolt and if one of these guys became king that would present a major problem for the rest of the world
7106724 ahh so you came for the greatest earth bender evers help right
7106725 of course im always up for an adventure plus itll be nice to get out of gaoling again ever since i traveled with you being here makes me bored its just not the same after youve been all over the world
7106726 yes well try being trapped in a small cell for a year then well talk
7106727 true that sister i feel for you but you didnt exactly give them a choice
7106728 mr obamas selection ended a two month search that was conducted almost entirely in secret it reflected a critical strategic choice by mr obama to go with a running mate who could reassure voters about gaps in his r sum rather than to pick someone who could deliver a state or reinforce mr obamas message of change

7106891 est claro que tambi n el colegio de los ap stoles unido a su cabeza recibi la funci n de atar y desatar dada a pedro
7106892 es el principio y fundamento perpetuo y visible de unidad tanto de los obispos como de la muchedumbre de los fieles
7106893 el pont fice romano en efecto tiene en la iglesia en virtud de su funci n de vicario de cristo y pastor de toda la iglesia la potestad plena suprema y universal que puede ejercer siempre con entera libertad
7106894 el colegio o cuerpo episcopal no tiene ninguna autoridad si no se le considera junto con el romano pont fice sucesor de pedro como cabeza del mismo
7106895 tambi n sujeto de la potestad suprema y plena sobre toda la iglesia
7106896 no se puede ejercer a no ser con el consentimiento del romano pont fice
7106897 no existe concilio ecum nico si el sucesor de pedro no lo ha aprobado o al menos aceptado como tal

7106910 the case for developing new research on humor and culture in organizations toward a higher grade of manure
7106911 theres an ernest hemingway quote we relied on for our title it always seemed to me that in those who make jokes in life the seeds are covered with better soil and with a higher grade of manure
7106912 the double entendre there is that people who use humor may be well full of it but theres a positive side as well
7106913 the ability to appreciate humor the ability to laugh and make other people laugh actually
7106914 its hard to know whats going to be funny or when to use humor
7106915 some people have suggested that you just avoid it all be funny dont try to make jokes we basically reject that
7106916 the most accepted theory of humor is incongruity theory that people find things funny when you take two things and you connect them in an unexpected way
7106917 often the very work youre doing provides common expectations you can build on customers clients coworkers yourself suppliers the building youre working in
7106918 or there are general human experiences like funny things kids say that almost anyone can share where people get into trouble is stepping on expectations such as with religion ethnicity or other values
7106919 the show the office regularly explores extreme cases of something that obviously happens in everyday life you have people who try too hard

7106922 in gods economy whether he is making a flower or a human soul nothing ever comes to nothing the losses are his way of accomplishing the gains
7106923 when suffering shatters the carefully kept vase that is our lives god stoops to pick up the pieces but he doesnt put them back together as a restoration project patterned after our former selves instead he sifts through the rubble and selects some of the shards as raw material for another project a mosaic that tells the story of redemption

7106926 hell fight back hell remind people rightly that being a liberal democrat means raising the minimum wage making sure everybody has affordable health care providing strong public schools and protecting human rights then hell ask why conservative republicans dont want the same things thats exactly the kind of political debate this country needs by picking biden as a running mate obama has signaled that he welcomes this argument and intends finally to win it
7106927 now this long metal rod is called a bat thats what you use to hit the ball
7106928 web 2 0 since why would you need to search for something when its already there
7106929 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7106930 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm

7106934 i hope this medal can be a message of peace in afghanistan
7106935 an education system that was once the pride of pakistan
7106936 the targeting of the peace committee sent a particularly chilling message because it was a brutal tactic by mehsuds forces to quash pro government groups in the region tribal elders said the killings appeared to directly challenge the policy of the new pakistani government to negotiate with militants rather than use military force some of the men had been shot others had their throats slit
7106937 resist all people from mehsud inhabited areas and neighbouring north waziristan who attack government installations and supporters of maulvi nazir
7106938 we will establish the writ of the government at all costs as a parallel government cannot be tolerated
7106939 a suicide bomber meanwhile blew himself up while being chased by police in the southwestern town of zaranj in nimroz province said the provincial governor ghulam dastagir azad the attack killed three people including two young girls and wounded five other civilians the police wounded the man before he blew himself up azad said
7106940 more insurgents roaming the countryside more bombings more violence of all kinds
7106941 mr alexander cites an unpublished un study that suggests public servants such as doctors and teachers now enjoy greater access to rural districts than they did a year ago despite increasing taliban activity that may indicate signs of d tente between government and insurgent figures at the lowest levels
7106942 in some cases the survey found afghan government officials can drive without armed escorts into districts where a visit by canadian troops routinely provokes a firefight
7106943 the fact that government employees are ranging farther into districts heavily influenced by the taliban shows that some afghans are finding pragmatic ways to live alongside the insurgents he says but its also a sign that government institutions are growing stronger and gaining support from villagers who want services
7106944 two years ago tarin kowt would have looked like a large black stain from where we are now standing now lights are burning and there is an enormous hustle and bustle of people engaged in commerce and many kinds of activities all sorts of things are going on

7106946 it is now technically possible to reproduce without the aid of males or for that matter females and to produce only females we must begin immediately to do so retaining the male has not even the dubious purpose of reproduction the male is a biological accident the y male gene is an incomplete x female gene that is has an incomplete set of chromosomes in other words the male is an incomplete female a walking abortion aborted at the gene stage to be male is to be deficient emotionally limited maleness is a deficiency disease and males are emotional cripples
7106947 hes an amazing guy and anybody would be lucky to be dating him
7106948 getting the first one is always great now we know what to expect its never easy its going to take a monumental effort on everyones part im not naive enough to think we can just show up and win it we have to play our best baseball

7106975 when a lawyer uses the enemy in order to advance what he thinks is our agenda he validates the enemy it would be better if the goal were simply to get the state to leave us alone any private business should be allowed to discriminate against men if it wishes the whole idea that such a business should be sued under the law is exactly the oppression that we are fighting against such tactics validate and legitimize the frivolous lawsuits that the femmies are so fond of bringing

7106980 hum vou para o estudio pretenciosamente na verdade eh so uma garagem ainda com um pano preto no fundo
7106981 its great to be on pole position especially after the great disappointment of budapest but im well aware the race is tomorrow and so there is still a long way to go my first run in q3 was very good and on the second i made a good improvement in the first sector and thats where pole came from today the track was still very slippery partly because of last nights rain after this mornings free practice i thought the harder tyres would be the most competitive in qualifying but at the start of the session i didnt feel as comfortable anymore and so we went for the softer compound the team did a great job in preparing for this event and i want to thank them for giving me such a strong car i hope we can have a good race tomorrow
7106982 fourth place is not what i was looking for but its definitely not the end of the world i could have been higher up the grid but on my last run in q3 i locked the wheels at a few points and lost valuable time it was nothing dramatic but at this circuit a small error is very costly i still think i can be in the fight for the win especially if i manage to get a good start we have a good car which should be especially competitive in the race
7106983 we are very happy with felipes first place and he really drove very well it was a shame for kimi who could have been a bit higher up the order even though fourth place cannot be considered a bad result all things considered a good day for the team even though we are well aware that its the race that counts tomorrow we can expect a sweaty afternoon and not just because of the heat we will have to pay great attention in managing all the possible scenarios that could occur the decisive factors will be the usual ones reliability first and foremost strategy performance and the work of the team and drivers on top of that there will be the unknowns that go with a track being raced on for the first time for our part we will do our utmost to try and bring home the best possible result in terms of the championship
7106984 ive never pitched very well in oakland a 9 00 era in three appearances so id love to have a good one
7106985 after all when i was at hayward i didnt even know where it was going i was a beanpole with bad mechanics and i just threw the ball as hard as i could i still have bad mechanics but at least i have some sort of clue now where its going
7106986 i guess theres value having me in the pen especially since ive been pitching a lot late in games with the lead
7106987 it doesnt really matter to me i just want to get to the playoffs for the first time
7106988 i havent had a real illustrious career as far as winning titles
7106989 my freshman year at hayward we won ncs and i wasnt even a big part of that team then one year in the minor leagues we won it all but that was it
7106990 but then an old coach of mine here in the east bay chris kyriacou now baseball coach at bishop odowd high talked me into staying around for a month i didnt want to do it i was thinking i have to get back in the workforce im 25 ive made no money i dont have a home i went back reluctantly
7106991 i just thought i could still compete at this level
7106992 as long as i get a chance i thought i can show what i got and these guys liked what they saw in spring training

7107009 once he gets fired up hes a guy whos scary
7107010 oh my god if you get him angry hes unstoppable hes one of the most athletic guys on the team and probably the fastest guy on the team
7107011 everyone whos a senior is looking to play at their best potential
7107012 im in competition just like everybody else its part of the deal everybodys in competition
7107013 umm i think we just want to make the big play thats what its about make the big play it could be an interception or a stop on a third down thats the same with any other position
7107014 i could tell you all the things he did wrong i always think he can do better hes got a chance to be a better football player than he was for games that he started
7107015 maybe not with the media and stuff like that but hes one of my best friends on the team hes a very open guy but hes also very quiet thats just his personality
7107016 hes a very quiet leader but there were a couple times today during practice when he went ahead and stepped up and said some things trying to get the guys going
7107017 hes very quiet so its hard for him to go out there and be a vocal guy he leads by example when you lead by example thats a good way to go
7107018 it felt good having mom and dad come up walking across the stage
7107019 we really havent seen him tackle much at this time
7107020 thats a concern because thats a part of the game

7107054 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake
7107055 its a well intentioned notion he has but its a very na ve way of thinking how youre going to conduct foreign policy
7107056 having talking points on foreign policy doesnt get you there
7107057 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

7107082 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7107083 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7107084 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7107085 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7107086 we did go in and did a whole bunch of levee work right after betsy
7107087 we were under the illusion that what we had done would prevent another betsy from flooding the area
7107088 the progress i see each time i visit is really remarkable the region has a better hurricane and storm damage reduction system in place than ever before in its history and it will continue to get better
7107089 we are in pretty good shape financially to do quite a bit of work in this area
7107090 its almost one of those proverbial you cant get there from where we are situations
7107091 all the human instincts post katrina are the same as post betsy
7107092 we keep building in holes and contractors keep trying to move in and take advantage of a situation they come in with a bunch of contractors sell off property in low places take their money and run
7107093 you see that green spot up there thats below sea level well below sea level
7107094 theres some people going to have dinner tonight out there in new orleans east theyre walking on the floor inside their house at 13 feet below sea level
7107095 were in the job of risk reduction not risk elimination
7107096 strictly relying on levees alone should not give anyone the impression they are risk free i think that would be a horrible mistake to make
7107097 what we learn from history is that we learn nothing from history
7107098 and whats going to happen after katrina pick a name and put it on it and its going to happen again unless we pull together to make sure
7107099 my number one place to buy gifts is green with glamour but i never can resist getting several things for myself as well its wonderful to know that you can be eco friendly ethically sound and not have to scrimp on style they do all of the whittling away so you are only browsing the creme de la creme it makes shopping so easy from eco fashion to beautiful furniture gwg has everything i could possibly want or need

7107123 readers new to the genre are not served well by recommendations to read isaac asimov ee doc smith robert heinlein or the like such fiction is no longer relevant is often written with sensibilities offensive to modern readers usually has painfully bad prose and is mostly hard to find because its out of print a better recommendation would be a current author such as richard morgan alastair reynolds iain m banks ken macleod stephen baxter and so on

7107131 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7107132 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7107133 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7107134 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7107135 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7107136 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7107137 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7107138 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7107139 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7107140 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7107141 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7107142 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
7107143 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
7107144 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7107145 we wont have to spend so much time fixing the broken toilets passengers wont need them
7107146 channel 9 is an intrusion into the tabernacle of the cockpit as elected custodians of the cockpit society we must maintain the sanctity of our pilot rituals and also avoid terrorist eavesdropping
7107147 we will still be able to eat in the employee section of the aircraft section a most of the passengers who used to sit there went to ba or some other airline which is ok with us they were so much trouble now we are able to chat with the non flying pilots and the family of the crews without complaints from other passengers up front

7107153 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7107154 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7107155 has continued in the best traditions for the vice presidency by selecting an exceptionally strong experienced leader and devoted public servant
7107156 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7107157 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7107158 can be ready but right now i dont believe he is the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training

7107230 young people are not actively turning to the communist party videos of chairman shii hammering on the problem of contract labor have certainly made the rounds on the internet but the reality is probably that disgusted by the ruling party and unable to expect much from the democratic party people are supporting the communist party as a result of choice by elimination
7107231 as mr shii says there is certainly a growing interest in marx but that doesnt necessarily translate into interest in socialism there are many who reject that i want to see what the communist party will do about this dilemma

7107243 a little reflection will show that humbug is an astonishingly wide spread phenomenon in fact almost universal
7107244 is some sort of daft wit or evidence of a pedantry bordering on the pathological
7107245 the wonderful thing about a steam engine is that you can follow the path of power generation and function beginning with the fire box and boiler follow the plumbing valves gauges gears d valves pistons eccentric shafts and fly wheels all the way from the source of power to the final outcome of kinetic potential
7107246 in all of the new steampunk design there is a strong nostalgia for a time when technology was mysterious and yet had a real mark of the craftsperson burnished into it
7107247 handicraft almost completely vanished the unity of design and production ended
7107248 pesky kids modding their nice beige computers how dare they
7107249 the wonderful thing about a steam engine is that you can follow the path of power generation

7107251 we are being taken for rubes at worst the steampunkers seem to be mediocre hobbyists with great publicists
7107252 one could easily argue that following the etched surface of a printed circuit board would provide no less a fascinating visual
7107253 im here look at me im gonna write a really agressive article and like that all diy community will know that im a humbug
7107254 i dont get it i dont want to get it nobody else should like it either
7107255 i love my mac i worship at the feet of steve jobs anyone who would sully the perfect design that is
7107256 people are defending the fun of a hobby against willful mischaracterization and unsupported criticisms such as the ones you provide they arent doing anything close to what you are projecting calm down
7107257 recalling an era that is the ground zero of mass production the cultural inflection point from the artisan to the manufactured
7107258 i guess cory is right any and all criticism of steampunk is legitimate no matter how ham handed inaccurate or contradictory and any problem with those critiques whether with the conclusions or the specifics is evidence of arrogance and self importance thanks cory
7107259 i agree with you that steampunk is full of arrogance and self importance and i would add elitism judgmentalism materialism and a high handed unflattering contempt for the common man
7107260 besides its not the victorian era its kitch you worship diyers brass leather and wood are so boring why dont you dare to try some art nouveau asthetics is it too difficult
7107261 opinions are like anal orifices everyone has one and they usually stink
7107262 if its not broke it doesnt have enough useless features
7107263 btw i tend to preferr art deco to art noveau and incorporate much of the former in my own steampunk creations
7107264 cory you remind me all too much of certain people whom i absolutely detested in the electronic music scene to whit the kinds who would visciously attack anyone who dared call a song breakbeat techno when it was obvious to everyone that it was actually happy hardcore or vice versa when i couldnt give 2 cents difference between the two styles
7107265 opinions are like orifices everybody has one and they usually stink

7107270 i hope you enjoy them if not oh well no skin off my nose
7107271 i think that alot of the comments here are slamming the article for missing the point of steampunk but in turn have missed the point of the article as near as i can tell the central critique of steampunk in this article is that he doesnt like form being valued over function
7107272 despite your claims your telephone mods have nothing to do with art nouveau or art deco plus they are not steampunk at all dieselpunk at best so i cant see why youve decided to show them here
7107273 people like this stuff and i dont understand it therefore i must tear it down
7107274 another fantasy to consider a world which isnt addicted to the evermore expensive oil industry
7107275 where do people get this idea that we all arrange huge hatefests where we burn ipods in effigy and self importantly expound at length about how were going to change the world through cultural revolution
7107276 imagine if you are capable if your infantile comprehension can fathom the concept a world in which the everyday item is asthetically pleasing in its function as well as durable enough to stand the tests of time rather than being slated for the recycle bin or rubbish heap after a very short lifespan another fantasy to consider a world which isnt addicted to the evermore expensive oil industry such a thing of beauty unfortunately for us would neither be easily mass produced nor would it be in the benefit of the rich capitalistic monopolists who strive only to make that next million dollars verily it is easier to mock a dreamer than to share the dream

7107394 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7107395 mobile computing devices with a screen size of 5 inches to 10 inches that run a full version of client operating system os such as windows xp or linux
7107396 the demand for mini notebooks will be driven by several factors by their small form factor and small screen their light weight their price their ease of use and their basic but sufficient pc functionality
7107397 mini notebooks are likely to attract a variety of users with different usage scenarios content consumption internet browsing e mail instant messaging im keeping in touch with friends and family storing and sharing pictures and so on
7107398 potential users are likely to include both first time buyers seeking a low cost introductory pc as well as experienced users seeking a low cost second or third pc for themselves or a relative

7107402 at first these lepers were so suspicious that they abused me and told me to leave but i built a hut here and began dressing their wounds their bodies are so weak that even a minor cut leads to ulcers and the wounds just fester as doctors refuse to treat them
7107403 we soon realised that treating wounds isnt enough they need to be integrated into society that is the aim of the divya prem sewa mission
7107404 initially it was tough convincing parents to send them to school since it was the kids that brought in the money but we worked to convince them that this would give them a chance at a better future
7107405 the focus is on basic skills reading writing and maths as well as developing character and physical fitness
7107406 the first time in front of a class is daunting but now i lecture confidently
7107407 in our institution the annual expenditure for a day scholar is rs 800 and rs 6 000 for a boarder
7107408 all my life i had been a self centred person i now found that there was greater satisfaction in giving
7107409 these suicides made me realise the kind of apathy our society showed towards the problems faced by kids irrespective of their socio economic background
7107410 the centre has been positioned not just as a counselling centre but as a place where the youth can hang out
7107411 the objective is to create an informal and friendly atmosphere where youngsters can work out problems through discussions with their peers as well as mentors
7107412 the feedback that most kids gave us was that if services were not free their parents wouldnt allow them to come
7107413 the core problem in our society is that the value of a child is seen in accordance with the marks that he or she gets
7107414 when a kid is not stressed about peer pressure or other growing up issues academics fall into place but all we do is expect results from them
7107415 i would like to open more youth centres where there are multiple activities since there is currently a huge shortage of places where kids can go but right now i find it difficult to even pay rent for this centre
7107416 we have to see what are the amendments proposed we can talk only after that but we will not accept any prescriptive amendment
7107417 there is an attempt by ireland new zealand and a few other countries to incorporate the hyde act conditions in the nsg draft but our stand remains the same
7107418 who has chosen to be in here doesnt want a photo or an epigraph it may be difficult to accept for those who remain behind but we need to respect the wishes of those who are no longer with us
7107419 those who made this decision did not want visibility why put their name and photo on a screen it is not right to put them in a box now even though it is a virtual one
7107420 im a sex blogger and i am writing a book about my experiences being in an open marriage
7107421 i love bill clinton but can you imagine being vice president
7107422 he has decades of experience in washington and yet uniquely he is not of washington he goes home to his family in delaware every single night
7107423 we have somebody who hasnt forgotten where he comes from and goes home to delaware every night on the train
7107424 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him he never moved to washington instead night after night week after week year after year he returned home to wilmington on a lonely amtrak train when his senate business was done

7107431 who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7107432 hes the guy who for all his washington experience is not beloved by the k street crowd of lobbyists hes told too many people what he thinks
7107433 when you think about joe biden you think about family
7107434 ive never met somebody who is both able to stick to their principles and yet negotiate with anyone from strom thurmond on the crime bill to jesse helms on the chemical weapons treaty
7107435 i was a better candidate than the other people and not because i was ready to lead the country
7107436 the fighting in georgia underscored the need to bring some foreign policy experience to the ticket no one does that better than biden
7107437 being from delaware myself i think thats pretty cool ive liked senator biden ever since he spoke to my 7th grade class during our class trip to washington
7107438 for a campaign that has consistently chided john mccain for being mired in the old washington guard and conducting the
7107439 but while biden 65 made strides during the primary season on curbing his legendary penchant for leaving no thought unspoken those who have watched him and listened to him over the years know the obama team will spend some sleepless nights wondering what he might say at any given moment
7107440 a safe choice even a smart choice but picking someone whos been part of washington for more than three decades is hardly change we can believe in
7107441 for biden the choice amounts to something like a political resurrection one that took nothing less than 20 years and one that has seen him evolve from firebrand to party statesman
7107442 just three hours after the obama campaign sent out its text announcement the mccain campaign rolled out its first ad this morning using senator joe bidens own words during the primary season about senator barack obama
7107443 i think it is an outright terrible decision on obamas part to pick biden yes he helps balance obamas inexperience on foreign policy but he also reminds people of it yes biden could conceivably be effective as an attack dog but biden is such a gasbag he makes the hindenburg look like a sack of rocks
7107444 barack obama told everyone he wanted a running mate who will challenge his thinking and now hes got one joe bidens tendency to speak his own mind and speak and speak is entwined in his dna
7107445 the thing is joe is old news very old news and hes got no executive experience to jerk around the national press for a full week only to deliver
7107446 after a week of excruciating suspense the big revelation is joe hairplugs
7107447 its hard for obama supporters to play the age card any longer as their potential veep is all of six years younger than mccain
7107448 this is a formidable ticket and a risky ticket and not a comfort zone choice for obama criticism will focus on bidens 1987 plagiarism bout his support of credit card companies he pushed the bankruptcy bill that dems now hate his comments about obama his racial obliviousness
7107449 the mccain campaign was quick to ridicule the choice there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden said his spokesman ben borritt
7107450 if not hillary clinton joe biden is absolutely the next best pick in my view no doubt many will be fueled to act out on this but theyre not thinking of the larger goal
7107451 i cant believe obama doesnt feel like hes sitting on a keg of dynamite with biden just hoping he doesnt go off
7107452 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee watch the first obama biden rally live at 3pm et on www barackobama com spread the word
7107453 its hard to put a time on t j i know hes better now than when we started practicing but i dont know i dont anticipate him playing in the opening game i hope to have him back by the third game

7107621 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7107622 we contacted the place where they were heading but so far they havent seen them
7107623 they left this morning and all their phone numbers are switched off we are not sure but it seems that they were kidnapped
7107624 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7107625 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7107626 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7107627 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7107628 it is the ppps own decision and it has nothing to do with the coalition
7107629 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7107630 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7107631 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7107632 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7107633 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers
7107634 a spontaneous explosion went off in a depot containing munitions taken from georgian tanks which we had not yet had time to destroy
7107635 there were no victims and no wounded among the residents and the russian soldiers
7107636 all activities of the russian peacekeeping contingent are based on the six principles that were signed in agreement by the presidents of russia and france
7107637 they want to keep these checkpoints as we know but they have no legal basis for it
7107638 until now the us supported russias integration in the world community we have admitted russia to the group of eight and we have saluted and encouraged its wish to join the wto
7107639 our position is that they should pull out to the sixth of august positions
7107640 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7107641 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic yeah
7107642 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7107643 if the doctor turned into an old man you would be a bit p off
7107644 even william hartnell who played the first doctor had trouble back then he was often ill and forgot his lines i think hell always probably tend to be around 40
7107645 as long as it was great and fantastic then yeah but a film is on for 90 minutes and that is not as important as the series but as long as it doesnt get in the way of the show we could do it
7107646 i would not rule out a film version of doctor who no
7107647 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7107648 shut up just shut up it is easy to find out whats going on with the show we virtually publish the scripts and we film in public
7107649 but in giving things away you become that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7107650 the show is really tough for a superfit david tennant so you might kill somebody who takes on the role in their 60s for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7107651 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7107652 never go in against a sicilian when death is on the line
7107653 never let your name be found in a dead mans trousers
7107654 other towers other turrets protruded from the medieval ch teau they called the temple deceptively religious name but this tower was different larger easily 60 feet in height and black like the inside of a chimney and lord of all its secrets whatever was in there stayed there
7107655 legend has it that if you give vidocq two or three of the details surrounding a given crime he will give you back the man who did it before youve had time to blink
7107656 more than that hell describe the man for you give you his most recent address name all his known conspirators tell you his favorite cheese
7107657 y was serious and dark and grounded in reality where doctor who is quite playful it does affect my mood at the table ive noticed
7107658 the trick is to find a way to graphically impersonate these characters their gestures and expressions so that it feels natural in the end its either spot on or something your uncle does at christmas dinner i dont know how close i am to the former fingers crossed its not the latter
7107659 maybe im just happy to be drawing so many men after drawing a gazillion women for the last seven years
7107660 that only just occurred to me a couple of weeks ago and it actually made me giggle
7107661 the power of the subconscious is a surprising and mysterious thing
7107662 at first i was thinking to have something elaborate on the floor beneath the doctor to make the first page splash really pop
7107663 but it should also have some meaning behind it and not just be some pretty eye candy that made me think of the seal of rassilon but since it makes an appearance on the next page it shouldnt be the actual seal and celtic knot work wouldnt really work but i wanted something like that elaborate and a little complex like the trouble hes in
7107664 i went online and started looking at tile work and this one piece jumped out at me it was an italian floor created by cosmati
7107665 i know it seems like a crazy amount of extra work for an easter egg but its those things that make the work more fun as you go its something i did a lot of on y and its a hard habit to break
7107666 when i was six i lived in finland for about a year and what television there was and of those the ones in english were all itv shows the phoenix and the carpet the muppets toms mindnight garden i claudius and grange hill they were all shows i enjoyed and they had a really specific look about them we later moved to toronto and i remember my aunt watching this show on tvontario that had that look there was a guy in a crazy long scarf and a girl dressed like andy pandy running around a nuclear power plant as a disembodied rock hand growled eldrad must live and it scared me silly i was hooked
7107667 i love the new stories like i loved those old fourth doctor ones especially with tennant who captures the doctors personality so beautifully that manic enthusiasm
7107668 but now theres the added bonus of seeing it from an adult perspective theres more of an appreciation for the story probably the best way to put it baker is the doctor of my childhood but tennant is my doctor today
7107669 there are a bunch of stories percolating in my head that id like to write
7107670 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7107671 today i have come back to springfield to tell you i have found that leader
7107672 barack has chosen senator joe biden to be our vp nominee
7107673 biden can go toe to toe on any challenge the mccain team throws his way he is a hard nosed brawler and champion of the working class
7107674 with this choice obama shows he plans to surround himself with smart and challenging people like jfk no yes men here

7107678 the spiritual disciplines are those personal and corporate disciplines that promote spiritual growth

7107688 but even if they want to debate it for a couple of hours let them do that after the resolution is adopted there should be an executive order reinstating the judges and the judges should be reinstated by monday night
7107689 in the latest one which was just two weeks ago we agreed that the judges would be restored with 24 hours of musharrafs impeachment or resignation this is a sacred document for us
7107690 after the turn of events in the last 10 12 days morally and democratically i felt i should resign and that is why i handed over my resignation

7107697 boxing is an aggressive sport and has its own glamour for youth the good performance of the three boxers including vijenders medal win has the nation waking up to the glamour of boxing this will really boost the visibility of the sport in india with vijender soon assuming the status of a fashion icon brands associated with youth action and macho will be pouring money into the sport
7107698 theres a lot of excitement around sports like boxing and shooting after indias success at the olympics vijender will be an attractive marketing and ad proposition for sports sportswear and even the cola companies
7107699 currently bindra is the superhero at par with big cricketers like dhoni or sachin if he is able to renew the popularity of the sport over the next few months he will be alive in the consciousness for a long time
7107700 vijenders win gives a big visibility and boost to non cricket sports like boxing but going forward his endorsement value will depend on how he is able to encash it through his future performance
7107701 though the sport will be in the limelight for a while it remains to be seen how much value it derives in the long term

7107816 there is no question that one of the most likely things that will happen in the next 40 years is that machine and human intelligence will come much closer together
7107817 the ability of humans to communicate with machines and for machines to communicate with humans will get so much better
7107818 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future

7107871 for sure starting on pole here is very nice the track here is not very easy the surface is slippery i had a good lap and i was able to score the pole position i think i have a good car for the race tomorrow which will be very difficult but i will try to do my best
7107872 i think i made pole position in the first sector the first sector was just fantastic i made some very small mistakes in sector two when you always have an oversteer car or understeer car depending on the corner then i had a good sector three but everything was done in sector one
7107873 for sure the track gets better all the time yesterday we saw the lap time getting crazier improving so quick from the beginning of the session we see that it was so green and as long as you put rubber on the track lap times improve a lot and the balance improves a lot as well i think yesterday we had a big big shower which doesnt help for the grip of the track so today was also difficult in the morning but its ok i think it is a nice track lets hope that we can have a good run tomorrow
7107874 for sure we have a great car we showed that at some many races this year we showed that at the last race unfortunately sometimes things happen we showed again here that we are competitive i think that is the most important thing the team did a great job today yesterday and also the preparation for this race which was also very difficult we went to the simulator trying to find a reasonable balance to start with and also the job done yesterday the team did a great job
7107875 yeah for sure it is always nice to be on top after such a bad result especially how it happened it was so bad to have a problem with three laps to go with a win completely in my pocket after such a difficult race it is very nice to be here for the first time in valencia and also after the problem we had in the last race and to be on the top but for sure the race is tomorrow and we dont know how it is going to be but it is always nice to start on pole position we will try to do a great race valencia is a nice place we always come here for testing and the city is fantastic i have been coming here since 2000 when i was doing formula renault and it is amazing how the city is getting bigger and bigger and so modern and a nice place to go nice hotels nice atmosphere it is very nice to be here and on pole lets hope that tomorrow we can have a great race
7107876 already in the first lap on q3 i was thinking the lap was good but you think people have made mistakes or didnt do a great lap you always need to try the second one and try to improve everything i think compared to my first try i improved the first sector that was really good i think i was a couple of tenths quicker than my first try in the first sector and it was already quite good the second sector was normal nothing special and the third sector was ok so i think the pole position came for sure because of the first sector which was great

7107955 as you know attorney general guidelines were first implemented in the wake of the fbi abuses of the 1960s and 1970s and serve as one of the most important bulwarks against future abuses
7107956 given the importance of these guidelines providing a period of time for public comment would be a reasonable and responsible way to move forward and achieve the best possible end result
7107957 the guidelines will require all activities to have a valid purpose

7107994 i have a small favor to ask of you dont refuse me
7107995 give abishag the shunammite to your brother adonijah as his wife
7107996 what kind of favor is this asking that abishag the shunammite be given to adonijah why dont you just ask me to hand over the whole kingdom to him on a platter since he is my older brother and has abiathar the priest and joab son of zeruiah on his side
7107997 may god do his worst to me if adonijah doesnt pay for this with his life as surely as god lives the god who has set me firmly on the throne of my father david and has put me in charge of the kingdom just as he promised adonijah will die for this today

7108004 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7108005 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7108006 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7108007 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7108008 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7108009 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7108010 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7108011 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7108012 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7108013 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7108014 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7108015 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7108016 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7108017 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7108018 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7108019 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7108020 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7108021 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7108022 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7108023 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7108024 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7108025 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7108026 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7108027 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7108028 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7108029 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7108030 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7108031 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7108032 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7108033 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7108034 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7108035 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7108036 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7108037 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7108038 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7108039 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7108040 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7108041 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7108042 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7108043 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7108044 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7108045 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7108046 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7108047 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7108048 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7108049 next time i race im not just going to win im going to wipe the floor
7108050 i can take my leg off and im completely free in the water
7108051 if we do nothing more if theres no extra investment above what we have now we will go backwards
7108052 thats based on seeing the amount of money other countries are investing even if we put a bit more money in well only tread water
7108053 be rightly pleased they have got more than their moneys worth people should be blown away
7108054 our position is that we would review high performance sport in terms of our policy after the olympics we didnt think it was appropriate to have any discussion about it until after the beijing olympics but it is no great secret that both the academy and the nzoc have serious financial pressures and we intend to address those in the next few weeks
7108055 address the high performance end of sport some time soon
7108056 the strategy is right and we have lots of confidence we are doing the right thing
7108057 can we do better of course we can should we do better absolutely are there things to improve on absolutely but the buzz around here from other nations is that we have done brilliantly
7108058 the number of others bubbling up in fourth to eighth those who get diplomas is important that indicates depth and flow on and is critical
7108059 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7108060 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7108061 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7108062 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7108063 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7108064 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7108065 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7108066 who are open to doing something on the production side
7108067 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7108068 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7108069 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7108070 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7108071 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7108072 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7108073 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7108074 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7108075 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7108076 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7108077 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7108078 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7108079 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7108080 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7108081 about the political issue of autisms and their alleged link to childhood vaccinations in the past as a metaphor for what we went thru with the debunked tort driven silicone breast implant sbi scare in the late 1980s
7108082 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7108083 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7108084 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7108085 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7108086 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7108087 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7108088 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7108089 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7108090 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7108091 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7108092 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7108093 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7108094 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

7108118 for its future china needs to become more international and the olympics was an important step in that
7108119 so it was crucial that the international community pay us due recognition

7108244 think of web page development lots of people are creating web pages with little or no knowledge of html they use simple interfaces like dreamweaver once weve developed the equivalent scientists will be able to use our system without having to learn little b
7108245 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
7108246 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
7108247 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
7108248 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
7108249 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
7108250 oh you just have arthritis you will have to live with it

7108252 la influencia en los casos nos dice que esta afecci n puede estar pasando los 300 000
7108253 eso es funci n del gobierno pero como la prevenci n tambi n tiene que ver con educaci n la promoci n de la salud si el gobierno pone de su parte te aseguro que la poblaci n bien enterada act a con mayor facilidad en esta parte de la prevenci n
7108254 mientras m s informaci n se tenga de las enfermedades que est n apareciendo reapareciendo o disminuyendo podemos ayudar en la prevenci n de las mismas vemos que el gobierno en vez de dar mayor informaci n la restringe tanto que el propio ministro de la salud en sus primeras alocuciones dijo que iban a disminuir las enfermedades y eso iba directamente relacionado con la informaci n epidemiol gica porque no se iba a seguir dando la informaci n como en la cuarta rep blica porque eso creaba alarma
7108255 el peor embuste que le ha creado el gobierno a venezuela es la creaci n de ese sistema paralelo de salud en vez de dotar los hospitales crearon un sistema paralelo de salud dirigido y orientado s lo por cubanos que de ellos sabemos que son cubanos no que son m dicos

7108287 we have reached a stage at which we have surrounded ourselves with more things but have less joy
7108288 a lot of our major builders are reporting contracts off as much as 25 percent year to date compared to year to date last year
7108289 so its no doubt the real estate market for used and new homes has slowed down significantly throughout the chicago market
7108290 higher prices have driven a wedge between upper and lower income households that now extends well beyond their personal financial situation
7108291 households in the bottom third of the income distribution held significantly more negative views about their own financial prospects as well as a more negative outlook for employment and economic growth
7108292 the current situation is exactly the opposite as the gap is now due to lower income households voicing much less favorable economic expectations when the economy is closer to the expansions peak
7108293 when asked about their financial prospects for the year ahead half of all families in the lowest third of the income distribution expected declines in their inflation adjusted incomes twice as frequently as among families with incomes in the top third
7108294 the growth rate in spending will slow over the next four quarters and be quite uneven across products that appeal to different income groups
7108295 i thought i was beyond getting nervous about giving a speech because ive given thousands
7108296 the path that these two people have traveled is uniquely american
7108297 i want to bring it down to a pretty basic level about who they are and why they represent the best of us
7108298 has more in common with most missouri families than john mccain does
7108299 weve tried it john mccains way for 7 1 2 years and it hasnt turned out very well
7108300 weve tried a foreign policy thats just focused just on iraq weve tried economic policies that are all about tax breaks for the very wealthy weve tried giving big oil everything they wanted frankly the results have really kind of stunk
7108301 i hope my two sisters would quit arguing over what i should wear
7108302 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7108303 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7108304 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7108305 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7108306 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him
7108307 the easiest and fastest way to demonstrate a change of foreign policy would be on climate change
7108308 this treaty is going to be so complex that the senate could not give its advice and consent
7108309 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7108310 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7108311 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7108312 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7108313 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7108314 the iraqi government wants this agreement to be valid just for three years
7108315 the full withdrawal will depend on the situation on the ground and the needs of iraqis and the decisions of the iraqi government
7108316 reasonable enough to see that it does them no good to coddle these criminals
7108317 senator mccain has stubbornly focused on maintaining an indefinite us presence in iraq but events have made his bluster and record increasingly out of touch with reality
7108318 while senator mccain continues to offer unconditional military and economic support for iraq i strongly believe that we need to use our leverage with the iraqi government to ensure a political settlement
7108319 conditions based withdrawals of us troops are the precise opposite course of that advocated by senator obama
7108320 senator obama seeks to withdraw all us combat forces regardless of the consequences for iraq or for american national security
7108321 i am glad the administration has finally shifted to accepting a timetable for the removal of our combat troops from iraq
7108322 success in iraq depends on an iraqi government that is reconciling its differences and taking responsibility for its future and a timetable is the best way to press the iraqis to do just that
7108323 i welcome the growing convergence around this pragmatic and responsible position
7108324 amid the controversies of the ministerial hierarchy the cpn uml will stay out of the government
7108325 we have not said we wont accept cpn uml leader in the second position in the protocol ranking we are ready to show flexibility regarding this
7108326 we come from 17 countries and we have one common goal and that is to break israels siege of 1 5 million palestinians
7108327 israel has to be held responsible for its policies toward the civilian population they have absolutely no right in international law to declare an economic siege on gaza to harm the civilian population thats a form of collective punishment which is illegal
7108328 our original mission was to sail into gaza open up a sea lane so that they can actually use their sea lane and then break israels siege and to tell the world that the gaza mediterranean belongs to the people of gaza
7108329 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7108330 the fighting that is still raging has so far left 12 militants and three soldiers dead including a colonel
7108331 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7108332 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7108333 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7108334 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out

7108339 why is the price of oil so high because the bush administration did to the commodities market what it did to housing
7108340 from the eco mba to the christian hipster college activism is alive and kicking but what todays students care about might surprise you this spring we posted a survey at motherjones com to find out what our readers think about the state of student activism how do todays campus movers and shakers stack up to their peace marching draft card burning hunger striking forebears among the respondents the consensus was clear 85 percent said students today are less politically active than they were in the 60s so where have all the hellraisers gone many are online nearly half of current college students told us that the future of activism is digital but nearly two thirds also said the future is on campus flesh and blood action is far from an anachronism but its becoming unthinkable without social networking tools to see how this mix of the old and the new works look no further than obamas young campaigners theyve got online organizing down to a science but unlike the deaniacs theyve mastered old school skills like canvassing door knocking and phone banking in november well see if they pass their biggest test luring their peers to the polls
7108341 in the end barack obama used unconventional means to announce a conventional choice for his running mate
7108342 the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7108343 obama names gaffe prone joe biden as his running mate
7108344 an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team
7108345 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service

7108351 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7108352 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7108353 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse
7108354 we are talking a potentially major and awful outcome for this child and it is our job to protect children when they cant make decisions for themselves
7108355 we played hard and we never gave up only in the second set we played badly
7108356 i am not too emotional personally the team has improved every day especially the young players
7108357 i am very lucky to have this crowd support the people here have given us a lot of care and love especially off the court
7108358 the gold medal match is always bitter sweet for the loser but what weve got to look at is that we got a silver medal
7108359 nobody expected it but we knew deep down inside that we were that good we came out to this tournament and fought our hearts out
7108360 we came to play the number one team in the world we got a game set off them and we could have taken them to five thats all we could ask for we are just thrilled

7108683 we are optimistic that senator bidens history of seeking practical means of addressing abortion will help move our nation beyond the divisive acrimonious and unproductive debate that has come to surround the issue senator biden accepts his churchs teachings on human life and can work to advance these teachings in ways that americans of all political persuasions can support
7108684 catholics united is especially hopeful that operatives on the far right will refrain from using senator bidens faith and the teachings of the catholic church as political weapons in the coming campaign faith and values should be used to unite americans behind solutions to the key challenges of this age war poverty lack of health care and a looming climate crisis and not as partisan wedges to divide voters

7108692 i have always seen him as a genuine eighteenth century philosopher a mixture of diderot and voltaire and this means that the opera then becomes an experiment with human nature in the first scene to show him as a philosopher and not a joker i had him appear at a table covered with books and classical references the drawings of sir william hamiltons neapolitan collections some of galvanis early experiments on animal electricity and thee might be a mesmeric tub in his room he is interested in all these scientific and intellectual developments of the enlightenment the view that ultimately all human beings are the same because all individuals partake in the nature of man is an eighteenth century idea it follows that if there is any escape from a basic human nature it is achieved only by acknowledging those parts of oneself that cannot be altered

7108713 well if i say that this case is related to your sisters death
7108714 your sister died in a car accident however a witness saw ishikawa crews in that car so they might be involved with your sisters death
7108715 even though ishikawa kazuko is a dangerous man but he has a daughter named rika and he loves her a lot she goes to an all school girl named gakuhou high school we want you to get close to her and if you have a chance then investigate her father
7108716 ill accept this case but i dont want to wear a skirt
7108717 dont worry about that we can ask a permission for you to wear pants by the way change your name to hitomi to hide your idenity

7108750 our take home message today is that the reason for the collapse of world trade center 7 is no longer a mystery wtc 7 collapsed because of fires fueled by office furnishings it did not collapse from explosives or from diesel fuel fires it collapsed because fires similar to those experienced in other tall buildings burned in the absence of water supply to operate the sprinklers and burned beyond the ability of firefighters to control fires it fell because thermal expansion a phenomenon not considered in current building design practice caused a fire induced progressive collapse

7108752 to apply thermite to a large steel column approximately 0 13 lb of thermite would be needed to heat and melt each pound of steel for a steel column that weighs approximately 1 000 lbs per foot at least 100 lbs of thermite would need to be placed around the column ignited and remain in contact with the vertical steel surface as the thermite reaction took place this is for one column presumably more than one column would have been prepared with thermite if this approach were to be used
7108753 unlikely that 100 lbs of thermite or more could have been carried into wtc 7 and placed around columns without being detected either prior to sept 11 or during that day

7108814 we see a lot of innovation in russia its been developing for quite a while i think its the right time and the right transition in the market for us to participate
7108815 its being able to have visibility and insight and learning into new technologies and new markets in russia in particular its being able to understand what kinds of innovations are going on in the startup community
7108816 we tend not to invest with the idea that were going to acquire the company later on that may happen but it certainly is not the intent of the majority of the investment

7108924 arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
7108925 i think john mccain would be a great candidate for vice president
7108926 but i think it is a reflection of the desire of this country and the desire of people in both parties to want to see this god awful vicious rift that exists in the nation healed and john and john could go a long way to heal in that rift
7108927 theres too much partisanship in america and theres too much partisanship in the senate

7108939 then in september 1987 the campaign ran into serious trouble when he was accused of plagiarizing a speech by neil kinnock then leader of the british labour party
7108940 within days it was also discovered that as a first year law student at syracuse law school biden had plagiarized a law review article in a class paper he wrote
7108941 if i lose to mccain ive lost to a really good man

7108944 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion

7108976 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7108977 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7108978 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7108979 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7108980 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7108981 we have seen some text campaigns in the many hundreds of thousands of opt in mobile users over the past couple years all in the consumer products services realm
7108982 this is the first massive effort in the political world
7108983 its a pretty big challenge because were under a strict time constraint to get all those messages out
7108984 we dont send a message to anyone who hasnt initiated contact with the campaign and opted in

7108995 a little reflection will show that humbug is an astonishingly wide spread phenomenon in fact almost universal
7108996 is some sort of daft wit or evidence of a pedantry bordering on the pathological
7108997 the wonderful thing about a steam engine is that you can follow the path of power generation and function beginning with the fire box and boiler follow the plumbing valves gauges gears d valves pistons eccentric shafts and fly wheels all the way from the source of power to the final outcome of kinetic potential
7108998 in all of the new steampunk design there is a strong nostalgia for a time when technology was mysterious and yet had a real mark of the craftsperson burnished into it
7108999 handicraft almost completely vanished the unity of design and production ended
7109000 pesky kids modding their nice beige computers how dare they
7109001 the wonderful thing about a steam engine is that you can follow the path of power generation
7109002 one could easily argue that following the etched surface of a printed circuit board would provide no less a fascinating visual
7109003 we are being taken for rubes at worst the steampunkers seem to be mediocre hobbyists with great publicists
7109004 one could easily argue that following the etched surface of a printed circuit board would provide no less a fascinating visual
7109005 im here look at me im gonna write a really agressive article and like that all diy community will know that im a humbug
7109006 i dont get it i dont want to get it nobody else should like it either
7109007 i love my mac i worship at the feet of steve jobs anyone who would sully the perfect design that is
7109008 people are defending the fun of a hobby against willful mischaracterization and unsupported criticisms such as the ones you provide they arent doing anything close to what you are projecting calm down
7109009 recalling an era that is the ground zero of mass production the cultural inflection point from the artisan to the manufactured
7109010 i guess cory is right any and all criticism of steampunk is legitimate no matter how ham handed inaccurate or contradictory and any problem with those critiques whether with the conclusions or the specifics is evidence of arrogance and self importance thanks cory
7109011 i agree with you that steampunk is full of arrogance and self importance and i would add elitism judgmentalism materialism and a high handed unflattering contempt for the common man
7109012 besides its not the victorian era its kitch you worship diyers brass leather and wood are so boring why dont you dare to try some art nouveau asthetics is it too difficult
7109013 opinions are like anal orifices everyone has one and they usually stink
7109014 if its not broke it doesnt have enough useless features
7109015 btw i tend to preferr art deco to art noveau and incorporate much of the former in my own steampunk creations
7109016 cory you remind me all too much of certain people whom i absolutely detested in the electronic music scene to whit the kinds who would visciously attack anyone who dared call a song breakbeat techno when it was obvious to everyone that it was actually happy hardcore or vice versa when i couldnt give 2 cents difference between the two styles
7109017 opinions are like orifices everybody has one and they usually stink
7109018 deformation of the form with a vengeance un insult to intelligence
7109019 an insolent piece of abstract symbolism an lechery in art
7109020 o rly please provide us a link to your creations to prevent us from getting bored
7109021 i tend to preferr art deco to art noveau and incorporate much of the former in my own steampunk creations
7109022 i hope you enjoy them if not oh well no skin off my nose
7109023 i think that alot of the comments here are slamming the article for missing the point of steampunk but in turn have missed the point of the article as near as i can tell the central critique of steampunk in this article is that he doesnt like form being valued over function
7109024 despite your claims your telephone mods have nothing to do with art nouveau or art deco plus they are not steampunk at all dieselpunk at best so i cant see why youve decided to show them here
7109025 people like this stuff and i dont understand it therefore i must tear it down
7109026 another fantasy to consider a world which isnt addicted to the evermore expensive oil industry
7109027 where do people get this idea that we all arrange huge hatefests where we burn ipods in effigy and self importantly expound at length about how were going to change the world through cultural revolution
7109028 imagine if you are capable if your infantile comprehension can fathom the concept a world in which the everyday item is asthetically pleasing in its function as well as durable enough to stand the tests of time rather than being slated for the recycle bin or rubbish heap after a very short lifespan another fantasy to consider a world which isnt addicted to the evermore expensive oil industry such a thing of beauty unfortunately for us would neither be easily mass produced nor would it be in the benefit of the rich capitalistic monopolists who strive only to make that next million dollars verily it is easier to mock a dreamer than to share the dream
7109029 there werent many middle fingers being extended back in the victorian era

7109036 i think the china government has done a very good job of presenting a positive image overseas but in doing so it didnt change much of its behavior to do that
7109037 this was part of the grand plan to show a new china and i think its delivered in many regards
7109038 china is trying to present itself as nonthreatening and in a lot of ways nonsocialist

7109238 we played hard and we never gave up only in the second set we played badly
7109239 i am not too emotional personally the team has improved every day especially the young players
7109240 i am very lucky to have this crowd support the people here have given us a lot of care and love especially off the court
7109241 the gold medal match is always bitter sweet for the loser but what weve got to look at is that we got a silver medal
7109242 nobody expected it but we knew deep down inside that we were that good we came out to this tournament and fought our hearts out
7109243 we came to play the number one team in the world we got a game set off them and we could have taken them to five thats all we could ask for we are just thrilled
7109244 you dont have a boyfriend or a girlfriend you havent messed around with
7109245 mr asif zardari has accepted to contest the election for the office of president of pakistan after the party unanimously drafted him to do so
7109246 it is the ppps own decision and it has nothing to do with the coalition
7109247 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7109248 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7109249 id like to take some risks on the field id like to be active rather than passive
7109250 when our team falls into a jam i always take the necessary risks
7109251 tonight we faced a good pitcher he was really tough on the batters
7109252 we were not able to execute in the last situation in the ninth inning but thats baseball
7109253 as a pitcher i was a little bit worried at the time and hoped that the coach would replace me with our top closer he made the right decision
7109254 it has been a blessing for me to be out on this court
7109255 i havent necessarily played great during this tournament tonight i got into some foul trouble as did diana taurasi and katie smith but we fought hard and we beat australia
7109256 we tried hard to get there but thats the way it goes
7109257 and thats what hurts the most id rather lose by 20 than two but its still disappointing
7109258 defense has been our strength the whole tournament and we just let them have 90 points thats not australian basketball
7109259 this is my last olympic games i want to thank many people including those who doubted me and those who supported me
7109260 you dont have a boyfriend or a girlfriend you havent messed around with a girl not even while drunk at a party
7109261 you dont have a boyfriend or a girlfriend you havent messed around with
7109262 schon wieder raus da komm ich doch grad erst her

7109265 make me a grey goose and soda but make it weak like youre making it for a baby
7109266 i learned about the companies that run this business and politics leverage and power
7109267 grew up with midwest values and always knew his parents loved him
7109268 i think i learned more about myself in that stretch of time than i did in the previous five or six years because life had gone very well for me up until that point
7109269 it was a real test are you prepared to lose something for the right cause essentially in my mind it became a question of can i show the same kind of resolve that i would demand from a character that i was writing ultimately i decided that it wasnt that big of a tragedy in the grand scheme of things that i didnt get to go to the shield for the finale i come from a place rockford ill where people do a lot tougher things than that it seems like a silly thing to whine about
7109270 we still finished it the way we set out to but what was miss ing was the familial aspect we werent together to do it and that was disappointing because weve been such a great team during the entire run of the series
7109271 look at the way he approached the final season he took the time to watch every episode that had been made in the first six seasons
7109272 thats just really rare for someone to approach his work with such humility and seriousness and attention to detail that does not come from ambition it comes from integrity
7109273 as a writer your job is to explore the moral issues that interest you the most
7109274 you cant be principled without really thinking about whats right and wrong and i think clearly shawn has done that shawn was always fascinated with the moral ambiguities of characters and i think the psychopathology of vic mackey makes him one of the greatest characters thats been written for television
7109275 he put his conviction into his words and that led to a whole new chapter in his life one which really established his position as being one of those voices out here in the tv landscape that defined show runners as artists
7109276 it created the map it created a model for how cable channels could create brand identities and it started an era that you didnt have to make a show that appealed to everyone
7109277 if you look at march 2002 there were a couple of exciting things on tv that premiered that year 24 and alias
7109278 but a lot of tv was getting very stagnant so there was an appetite for this kind of stuff its not like i conjured up a new way of doing television and cable becoming this new mecca for quality writing and acting i was just trying to do my little show and we got really lucky with the timing those gates were ready to open whether it was us or somebody else
7109279 i like songs that have a strong ending and books that have the confidence to end and say this or that

7109281 as many of you may have heard already in an interview at leipzig the senior producer for littlebigplanet announced that the game is region locked this is in fact not the case and all shared levels in the game will be available worldwide
7109282 the confusion arose out of regional differences in how moderation will work as there are different legal rules each region have to play by and at one point this looked like it may require the game to be independent in each region however this has been worked around and there will only be one region for the game a littlebigregion

7109286 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7109287 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania

7109293 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7109294 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7109295 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7109296 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7109297 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7109298 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7109299 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7109300 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7109301 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7109302 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7109303 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7109304 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7109305 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7109306 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7109307 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7109308 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7109309 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7109310 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7109311 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7109312 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7109313 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7109314 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta
7109315 por su vida y la de su n cleo familiar
7109316 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7109317 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7109318 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie

7109320 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7109321 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica

7109323 and while vulcan is leading the charge its still his brother havok thats on his mind
7109324 his twisted life has messed him up pretty bad and him not killing havok and the x jammers is the question on the shiars minds for sure does he enjoy torturing them at first maybe but he wants something more he just doesnt know how else to get it
7109325 havok allowed himself a moment of doubt and weakness as seen in divided we stand 2 and now hes focused on one thing killing vulcan
7109326 polaris chod and raza are in there too and each of them is holding up as best they can but the thing is killing vulcan was havoks goal before the others were supporting him now they all want him dead vulcan really really should have just killed them
7109327 theyve been on the run hunted by imperial guardsmen and death commandos alike theyre intent on finding the rest of their team and liberating them from vulcans grasp
7109328 but at the same time we have his focus split hes obsessed with breaking havok and capturing rachel and x men dont just lie down and die even captured tortured and on the run x men are dangerous
7109329 vulcan is waging war on the galaxy and beyond the x jammers are few the imperial guard is many and vulcan is unhinged and radically powerful
7109330 but events occur that cause things to shift vulcan is running out of patience hes making decisions that will cost him and the x jammers are going to take advantage of that
7109331 its got a lot of intergalactic drama but its got a bit of escape from alcatraz to it as well it is different than emperor vulcan because its getting so very personal between the two brothers the tension is growing and growing
7109332 its two brothers at war over the murder of their father its meaty stuff
7109333 its a great cast of soldiers pirates x men alien ambassadors and raving lunatics youve got characters like chod and raza whom ive come to love and imperial guardsmen like gladiator whos a fascinating character all that power but loyal to a throne regardless of what scum sits on it deathbird is so very deadly and lilandra seems like just the opposite but she had that side to her too its a great cast something the x universe has never lacked
7109334 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7109335 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7109336 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7109337 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7109338 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto

7109342 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7109343 es incre ble que en un pa s democr tico en el cual muchos han ca do muchos han sido encarcelados muchos han sido desterrados a n no se goce esa libertad de expresi n a n tengamos que estar en c rceles a n no podamos disfrutar de verdad lo que significa
7109344 con un temor a poder decir estoy en libertad y yo pienso esto
7109345 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana

7109352 al a o 2025 las energ as renovables y la eficiencia podr an entregar 30 m s de electricidad al sic y juntas aportar an 7 600 mw al sistema
7109353 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
7109354 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
7109355 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
7109356 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente
7109357 debe existir una regulaci n que diga concretamente en chile no se puede importar equipos que tengan eficiencias menores a tanto y eso cambiar a el panorama
7109358 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones
7109359 todas las investigaciones actuales muestran que los f siles tienden a subir de precio en forma estable tanto el petr leo como el gas natural el carb n y el recurso de embalse se est agotando las tecnolog as de las nuevas fuentes en cambio est n madurando y muchas de ellas ya tienden a la baja y se van a hacer cada vez m s competitivas lo que impulsar el desarrollo de las fuentes no convencionales
7109360 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7109361 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7109362 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7109363 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7109364 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano

7109367 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7109368 mike green is soft he is pretty he will never make a big impact in the nhl while vishnevski is tough plays with snarl in his game and is a stand up bone jarring d man the likes we havent seen in dc since scott
7109369 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7109370 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7109371 i said that before the senator abandoned his principles and turned himself into a bush republican
7109372 i know i speak for every american when i say we are all georgians today
7109373 in my 34 year career i have never wavered from the notion that the only time progress has ever been made in the middle east is when the arab nations have known that there is no daylight between us and israel
7109374 so the idea of being an honest broker is not i think like some of my democratic colleagues call for is not the answer it is being the smart broker it is being the smart partner
7109375 why is biden obamas running mate if he used to doubt obamas experience and praise mccain
7109376 in case you didnt know i was out of the primary pretty early and sat as an unbiased spectator without endorsing anybody and i was amazed by barack obama he gets it this man is the next great american president
7109377 mccain of 2008 is a sell out mccain in 2000 condemned george bush for running a low road smear campaign and then at the first sign of trouble in the polls runs and hires the same people who ran bushs campaign
7109378 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7109379 sure lots of people praised mccain of 2000 and maybe even 2004 but now i dont know who mccain of 2008 even is the guy who cant tell who shia and sunni are the guy who refused to vote against torture the guy who refused to vote for an increase in educational benefits for soldiers because well in his words it might mean soldiers would not want to be soldiers anymore

7109384 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7109385 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7109386 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7109387 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7109388 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7109389 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7109390 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7109391 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7109392 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7109393 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7109394 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7109395 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7109398 the fedora infrastructure team is currently investigating an issue in the infrastructure systems
7109399 as long as youre damaging at least some part of the file
7109400 an extremely high percentage of the hidden files were destroyed
7109401 is it better to know who is doing the attacking or to stop the attack from happening
7109402 sometimes catching an intruder is less important than preventing the potential damage caused by releasing that information
7109403 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7109404 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7109405 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7109406 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7109407 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7109408 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7109409 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7109410 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7109411 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7109412 n o precisamos ag entar george w bush por mais quatro anos
7109413 precisamos de um l der s bio que possa realizar as mudan as necess rias obama far o que precisamos
7109414 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7109415 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7109416 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7109417 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7109418 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7109419 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7109420 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7109421 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7109422 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7109423 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7109424 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7109425 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7109426 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7109427 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7109428 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7109429 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7109430 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7109431 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7109432 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7109433 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7109434 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7109435 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7109436 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7109437 als het om gebed gaat zijn we geneigd om verdedigend lusteloos ingewikkeld en verward te doen wat een schitterende onbevangenheid heeft een kind daarentegen en juist dat is wat onze heer ons wilde leren
7109438 gebed is in onze ogen niet nuttig het is onnozel en pas als wij inzien dat gebed onnozel is dat wil zeggen onnozel vanuit het oogpunt van het alledaags gezonde verstand pas dan zullen wij bidden het is dwaas om te denken dat god dingen gaat veranderen in antwoord op gebed maar dat is wel wat jezus zegt te zullen doen het klinkt onnozel maar het is een onnozelheid die gefundeerd is op zijn verlossing de reden dat onze gebeden niet worden verhoord is dat we niet onnozel genoeg zijn om te geloven wat jezus zegt
7109439 hoe dichter abraham bij god kwam in zijn voorbede hoe sterker hij zijn volstrekte onwaardigheid moest erkennen zie toch ik heb mij verstout tot de here te spreken hoewel ik stof en as ben genesis 18 27 oprechte onwaardigheid is nooit m r verlegen voor god dan een kind verlegen is voor zijn moeder een kind van god is zich alleen maar bewust van zijn volkomen afhankelijkheid van god
7109440 het betekenisvolle van voorbede is dat we zien hoe god handelt
7109441 wat gij ook vraagt in mijn naam ik zal het doen
7109442 indien gij mij iets vraagt in mijn naam ik zal het doen
7109443 de enige die bidt door de heilige geest is het kind de kindergeest in ons de geest van volledig vertrouwen in god
7109444 er is maar n soort mens die werkelijk kan bidden en dat is de gelovige die als een kind wil zijn het eenvoudige onnozele op gods kracht vertrouwende kind van god en dan bedoel ik ook echt onnozel als je probeert op grond van verstandelijke argumenten te verklaren waarom god gebed verhoort is het onzin god verhoort gebed op grond van geen andere reden dan de verzoening
7109445 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7109446 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7109447 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7109448 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7109449 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7109450 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7109451 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7109452 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7109453 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7109454 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7109455 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7109456 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7109457 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7109458 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7109459 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7109460 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7109461 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7109462 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7109463 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7109464 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7109465 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7109466 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7109467 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7109468 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7109469 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7109470 het zal nooit gods bedoeling geweest zijn ons tot geestelijke poppen of babys te maken het is gods bedoeling dat wij zonen en dochters van hem worden
7109471 bedankt voor deze mededeling kun je me even nog erbij vertellen wat ik ermee moet
7109472 en nu uitgenuanceerd want nog even en ik heb helemaal niks meer gezegd
7109473 als ik saddam toch maar eens vond en die gedachten langs de wet och wie maalt waar het vandaan komt geen hond die daar op let
7109474 waar was je gisteravond je liet me wachten in ons bed en o ik weet waar jij vandaan komt je was weer bij die slet
7109475 i think the two of them together would beat john mccain
7109476 in a week were not going to be talking about his pick hes going to be right back where he was in the polls
7109477 i cant give you an answer i dont think anybody else can
7109478 i frankly cant understand why and i assume he must have some reasons that are unknown to me but hes thought all the issues out and weighed all the factors and decided someone else is the best
7109479 it was a tough time almost 36 hours it was very hard for many of us
7109480 they are very brave they are very strong i am proud of them
7109481 in this media war it was impossible for them israel to win because they have no case for what they are doing to your port and to your borders
7109482 we call for more activities to break the unfair siege imposed on our people
7109483 this decision was about these boats we will see what happens with any future boats
7109484 als je een fanatieke purist bent moet het wel lukken denk ik maar helemaal schone handen hebben wordt steeds moeilijker tegenwoordig
7109485 ik had in die tijd collegas die als enige argument om op het cda te stemmen hadden paars heeft er een zooitje van gemaakt terwijl ze helemaal niets hadden met het cda laat staan me konden vertellen waar het cda dan voor stond dat vind ik dus veel te kort door de bocht je kon op je klompen aanvoelen dat een coalitie van lpf cda en vvd een op een aantal vlakken een sociale ramp zou zijn net zoals je ook weet dat een puur linkse colatie veelal een economische ramp is wat gechargeerd gezegd diezelfde cda stemmers hadden al vrij snel na de formatie vreselijke spijt van hun keuze
7109486 de n deed het raam open en de ander flikkerde de centen eruit
7109487 ik zou ook niet snel stemmen op die man maar toch ik wil niet bij voorbaat iemand afwijzen op zon verleden misschien is dat naief maar ik geloof graag in het principe dat mensen niet statisch zijn en ook andere inzichten kunnen krijgen al kan ik niet met zekerheid zeggen dat dat bij bos het geval is
7109488 maar om een omwenteling in mentaliliteit te krijgen of idee n er door te drukken verzwijgt de politiek bewust de geldbom die ze ter beschikking heeft en waarop men makkelijk kan terugvallen als de nood aan de man is
7109489 okay hier kan ik mee leven al weet ik dat het bij lange na niet minimaliseer
7109490 welcome to matala george today is life tomorrow never comes
7109491 today is the first day of the rest of your life
7109492 dit moet niet n g een dag zo doorgaan of ik ga er wat van zeggen
7109493 maar voor 5 euro had ik eigenlijk kilos appels kunnen kopen en had ik de pitten er gratis bij gekregen
7109494 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7109495 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7109496 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7109497 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7109498 het drietal laat zich overhalen naar afghanistan te trekken om te helpen te midden van een oorlogssituatie
7109499 figure out which of the kitchen tables to sit at
7109500 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7109501 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7109502 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7109503 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7109504 spore 2 or anything how can you do that but elements from spore will appear all over maxis
7109505 this exploration is now banned by a provision included in the annual interior appropriations bill
7109506 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7109507 they have protected billions in tax give aways for big oil and tax loopholes for businesses who ship jobs overseas rather than making a serious commitment to the development of clean alternative energy that can transform our economy and create thousands of new jobs
7109508 the announcement of joe biden as barack obamas running mate is terrific news
7109509 senator biden has been a strong voice for working americans in the senate
7109510 i really think its funny that senator obama wants to get into a debate on housing he is not exactly poor either
7109511 obviously theres allegations and a disconnect here the sooner we can get that cleared up and get it official the better off well all be
7109512 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7109513 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7109514 apr s une s rie de coups de fil qui ont dur toute la journ e nous sommes parvenus un accord avec chelsea andre sera dimanche soir milan lundi il passera la visite m dicale puis il signera son contrat et d s mardi il sera la disposition de carlo ancelotti nous avons r ussi faire revenir la maison le joueur qui a marqu le plus de buts avec notre maillot depuis 50 ans
7109515 le pr sident berlusconi et moi sommes heureux ainsi que lentra neur et je crois que nos tifosi doivent l tre aussi
7109516 president sarkozy insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible
7109517 i think what russia has done now is the strongest catalyst it could have created to get georgia in nato
7109518 while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here
7109519 we went up in a cable car and a toboggan down so that was really good fun
7109520 sometimes you see all these people walking around and its like oh my god i just walked past an olympic gold medalist
7109521 everything i imagined the olympics to be imagine that times 10 and thats how it feels to be in the olympics
7109522 figure out which of the kitchen tables to sit at
7109523 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7109524 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7109525 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7109526 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7109527 it was a brief conversation theyve known each other for years
7109528 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7109529 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7109530 biden has denounced barack obamas poor foreign policy judgment and has strongly argued in his own words what americans are quickly realizing that barack obama is not ready to be president
7109531 thats the kind of way we were used to playing last year that was something we needed to see
7109532 that gives us a little confidence with the season around the corner
7109533 i tried to bait the guy a little bit but he did a great job and got underneath the ball
7109534 it was nice to see him regroup after the interception
7109535 to come out of the two minute situation with points is a positive that gave us a shot in the arm
7109536 we could have done a ton more we didnt go that deep in the playbook as long as we get into the rhythm and feel good about each other and what were doing the skys the limit
7109537 well probably start looking at cleveland probably more in depth now and start preparing for them
7109538 everything offensively went well passing game the run game just the way we moved the ball down the field
7109539 when i first found out that i was moving to manchester i was so happy a chance to move away prove my sanity and escape the suffocating outreach service i am under but it seems like i am going to be dumped in a see of concrete that is owens park and left to fend for myself as the ex lovely psychiatrist has realised that although they have promised me the world with a care coordinator assigned to me before i arrive up north and all the perks that camhs might think anyone wanting to escape might want cannot be provided
7109540 yesterday out of nowhere i was bludgeoned with the graphic image of my throat being cut slashed
7109541 after discussing his symptoms with him the doctor asked mr man if he would go into hospital voluntarily but he refused the doctor asked me if i agreed that mr man needed to go into hospital and i did so arrangements were made for a psychiatrist and a social worker to attend
7109542 i tell him i havent got a clue what hes talking about
7109543 yes you have an appointment to see dr x on tuesday 27th at 9 15 i dont know why you havent been informed but i certainly did my bit
7109544 systems in place to prevent this kind of thing occurring
7109545 there are scenarios when im twitchy and would see risks as unacceptable almost always since these are discussed as a team with the patient carers concensus can be reached and a sensible management plan generated with prescribing its a little different since i do that in discussion with the team but prescribe independently
7109546 they were taken under the threat of firearms it was an abduction
7109547 its clear that they were kidnapped because their schedule was to come back to the hotel before 12 in the afternoon and we dont have their whereabouts
7109548 we contacted the place where they were heading but so far they havent seen them
7109549 they left this morning and all their phone numbers are switched off we are not sure but it seems that they were kidnapped
7109550 we know what its like to sit around the kitchen table after putting the kids to bed thinking about what it is you need to make it the biggest worry john mccain has is deciding which kitchen table to sit at
7109551 you cant change america by voting with george bush 95 of the time
7109552 je d colle mon papier peint rien quen le regardant avec un air mauvais
7109553 je trouve ce que je veux casto les yeux ferm s et a me rend heureuse
7109554 ik kan mijn teen in mijn mond krijgen ik kan het echt maar nu even niet
7109555 as gane empate o pierda con independiente dejar el cargo
7109556 of course it is mych broader anytime they adopt a citizen surveillance project it always becomes much larger doesnt it
7109557 this is a vast expansion of the technology and a vast change in the goal of the technology
7109558 does make one wonder doesnt it like would such a system have helped prevent 9 11
7109559 the technology has reached the point where its very good now it puts a tool in the hands of police officers out in the street to help fight terrorism
7109560 and therin lies the rub bank databases credit card databases who decides what and when this is scary
7109561 and so new york city becomes a fortress to keep the bad guys out but that also enables control over who is within and who is next miami chicago san francisco los angles houston and on and on until america is a land of fortresses controlled by their police departments are not tallahassee florida and canton ohio prime examples of why we do not want that to happen
7109562 doesnt calling 911 provide the same service at less cost
7109563 the department of homeland security will now have an enormous amount of information about the travel habits of washington area residents
7109564 well have to carefully weigh all those privacy issues and make sure we do it the right way
7109565 or whatever database is plugged into it remember is this is whatis known as government doublespeak
7109566 it will help us identify other types of criminal activity
7109567 normally they focus most of the money on government agencies but the hospitals are a critical part of the response to any natural disaster or terrorist attack
7109568 uno de los objetivos de este gobierno era acabar la oficina del narcotr fico que se llama oficina de envigado
7109569 a m lo que me da tristeza es que fiscales de medell n se hayan dejado corromper eso es muy grave y me siento frustrado
7109570 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7109571 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7109572 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7109573 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and understand the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7109574 if hes happily married with children its kind of wrong but not really
7109575 durf de stad te ontdekken door de weg kwijt te raken

7109578 what happens if i dont earn enough to support myself with what im doing
7109579 what if my family needs me to share the bills
7109580 if you get those individuals that fit the federal requirements it creates the american dream like no other program ive ever witnessed
7109581 whether it happens now or next year it will be a dream come true for these families
7109582 a house in galveston for this price would either be really old or rundown or have something wrong with it

7109604 due to the powers of allesas thoughts the whole town is transfigured into the otherworld

7109609 anyone swallowed up by that world will live there for eternity undying

7109615 if the governor wants to come and look at our budget and then show us how were being wasteful thats fine but i dont think the governors job is to fix local problems and to tell local people how to spend their money
7109616 it might be nice if the legislature would focus on their spending and where their funds are coming from

7109629 when he ran for president in 1988 biden was accused of plagiarism when he did not credit neilkinnock then leader of the british labor party for much of his stump speech
7109630 was forced to quit the 1988 presidential race inthe face of accusations that he had plagiarized
7109631 for instance joseph biden comes off as a liberal democrat but hes the one who authored the bill that put me in jail he wrote the law against shipping drug paraphernalia through the mail which could be anything from a pipe to a clip or cigarette papers
7109632 i wouldnt have run that piece there was nothing in it

7109639 in this race the good people of connecticut should know that barack obama supports jim himes and believes himes is the candidate who will bring the change american families need to washington
7109640 did mccain ask his biased staff members to recuse themselves and then ask others to help him get his facts straight
7109641 what im most proud of in my entire career is the violence against women act
7109642 it showed we can change peoples lives but the change is always one person at a time there are many more laws and attitudes that need changing so women are treated with equal opportunities at work in the classroom and in our health care system
7109643 were not blaming the doctors for what they produce they have a compromised bit of software and that has led to at least frustration for us and some danger it could turn into something more serious
7109644 very early on there should have been a strong consensus that gps and pharmacists should use the same system

7109646 theyre expecting to come in and beat us theres no doubt about it

7109653 but if someone wants to believe the only way bolt can do what hes doing is through doping that is their prerogative
7109654 we feel the deterrent effect played a part in what we see

7109667 sebagai pemain sinetron memerankan tokoh antagonis itu tantangan buat dia
7109668 we played a very solid opening five minutes but struggled for any consistency the rest of the game
7109669 in order for us to be successful this season we will need to play a more complete game from start to finish this was our first game and i know that we are going to get better we just have to get back to work and get ready for our next home game on sunday
7109670 hanya orang orang yang berkepentingan saja yang bisa hadir di sini
7109671 coach william savarese believes in his players and loves to win
7109672 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7109673 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7109674 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7109675 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7109676 i am clearly devastated by this my hope is that the poker community will help me try and recover the irreplaceable items that were taken
7109677 i truly appreciate the outpouring of love and support i have received
7109678 this is what the fake lyrics allowed me to do completely write earnestly from the point of view of a republican ex fratboy guy whos trying to make it at his law firm and is horrified cause his girlfriend has left liberal views and its fun
7109679 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
7109680 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
7109681 theres going to be added pressure whenever youre given the type of money they invested in me
7109682 to set foot back on american soil and to know what i did so many thousand miles away it completes the journey im just really glad to be home
7109683 you dream about it but when it actually happens i dont even know what to think youre drawing a blank its like wow we just did something incredible here its surreal
7109684 that just makes what theyve done even more remarkable the experience was amazing you had 18 000 people cheering for the u s a it was amazing
7109685 in my own effort to illuminate the character and career of abraham lincoln i have coupled the account of his life with the stories of the remarkable men who were his rivals for the 1860 republican presidential nomination new york senator william h seward ohio governor salmon p chase and missouris distinguished elder statesman edward bates
7109686 i mean you got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7109687 warren buffett is right i would eliminate the tax cut for the wealthy they didnt ask for it and as someone earlier said they dont need it
7109688 where we can america must why darfur because we can we should now those kids will be dead by the time the diplomacy is over
7109689 this administrations mishandling of the war in iraq may be the greatest foreign policy disaster of our times the next president is going to have to be prepared to immediately step in and act without hesitation to end our involvement in iraq
7109690 i think he can be ready but right now i dont believe he is its awful hard with only a little bit of experience to have a clear sense of what you would do on the most critical issues facing us today
7109691 john mccain is a personal friend a great friend and i would be honored to run with or against john mccain
7109692 rudy giuliani theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7109693 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7109694 i made some mistakes and now the exaggerated shadow of those mistakes has begun to obscure the essence of my candidacy and the essence of joe biden
7109695 i think youre a damn war criminal and you should be tried as one
7109696 if i end up with the numbers the way you just read them in the national poll sure im out of the race but im not going to end up that way i may surprise you all
7109697 we have not said that wally west will not be the flash
7109698 some of the more recognizable wally west stories deal with the barry allen lore and what his legacy is a lot of wally cant be explained without barry so therefore it was essential we thought for barry to come back and at that point wed undone so much of what
7109699 i used to be in taxi cabs with dan and just say we have to bring barry allen back
7109700 now is the time for this character flash is a csi scientist its a whole new avenue for flash stories and these are stories geoff and i want to tell and you have to give us the room now this isnt a reboot we are going to make this part of one long continuous story just like with hal jordan everything that was done even before us was part of a much larger picture were going to do the same thing with barry allen and the entire flash legacy
7109701 what happens is that if a character doesnt work we go we got a brand new direction to put him in
7109702 our biggest mistake is that we dont continue and build on what we should be doing is let it sit for a while and then come back with a good strong story with whats going on
7109703 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work
7109704 billsinsider com is a great website bills fans are unbelievably rabid and knowledgeable good stuff
7109705 i think the bills insider does a great job of following the bills they give the most accurate facts and in depth stories that i have found on the internet keep up the great work

7109707 docs and local police are still looking to find the family
7109708 i dont agree with the one size fits all policy he is a small baby 2 49 kilograms five pounds eight ounces and they give the same dose to babies twice his size i just wanted time to get more information about the vaccine
7109709 itll be something thatll have to be assessed once that child is located
7109710 i am a strong believer in vaccinations being voluntary but not getting this baby vaccinated is a form of child abuse

7109715 canadians will like the fact that both of them are opposed to the war in iraq
7109716 theyll like the fact that theyre both knowledgeable about world affairs theyll like that obama and biden will take a multinational approach and not an our way or the highway approach to international issues
7109717 the idea that we are not willing to take the prime minister of canada and the president of mexico to the mat to make this agreement work is just a lack of presidential leadership
7109718 certainly obama and biden will take a more aggressive approach to increasing fuel efficiency for automobiles thatll be tough on the auto industry but they can do it and generally they favour a more aggressive approach on environmental regulation
7109719 so right at the top of the ticket you have someone who brings significant expertise in areas that concern canadians

7109724 if we do nothing more if theres no extra investment above what we have now we will go backwards
7109725 thats based on seeing the amount of money other countries are investing even if we put a bit more money in well only tread water
7109726 be rightly pleased they have got more than their moneys worth people should be blown away
7109727 our position is that we would review high performance sport in terms of our policy after the olympics we didnt think it was appropriate to have any discussion about it until after the beijing olympics but it is no great secret that both the academy and the nzoc have serious financial pressures and we intend to address those in the next few weeks
7109728 address the high performance end of sport some time soon
7109729 the strategy is right and we have lots of confidence we are doing the right thing
7109730 can we do better of course we can should we do better absolutely are there things to improve on absolutely but the buzz around here from other nations is that we have done brilliantly

7109744 train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it
7109745 and ye fathers provoke not your children to wrath but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the lord
7109746 these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children
7109747 ye shall teach them your children speaking of them when thou sittest in thine house and when thou walkest by the way when thou liest down and when thou risest up
7109748 let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation in charity in spirit in faith in purity
7109749 for men shall be lovers of their own selves covetous boasters proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy
7109750 in that day i will perform against eli all things which i have spoken concerning his house when i begin i will also make an end for i have told him that i will judge his house forever for the iniquity which he knoweth because his sons made themselves vile and he restrained them not
7109751 thou shalt rise up before the hoary head and honor the face of the old man and fear thy god i am the lord
7109752 correct thy son and he shall give thee rest yea he shall give delight unto thy soul
7109753 chasten thy son while there is hope and let not thy soul spare for his crying
7109754 he that spareth his rod hateth his son but he that loveth him chasteneth him betimes
7109755 children who are allowed to come up to manhood or womanhood with the will undisciplined and the passions uncontrolled will generally in after life pursue a course which god condemns
7109756 fathers provoke not your children to anger lest they be discouraged
7109757 now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous but grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby

7109764 is there an issue on which he would do the unpopular thing or break with party orthodoxy
7109765 will he break from the status quo on muslim relations or will he turn his back on the
7109766 will it deepen the impression that hes more of a rock star than a person of serious public purpose or can mr obama have the serious conversation he needs to reassure americans

7109785 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7109786 biden brings to the table his ability to speak knowledgeably about issues ranging from foreign policy to to the countrys domestic agenda
7109787 my impression is obama thinks that if we leave somehow the iraqis are going to have an epiphany
7109788 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7109789 but and the but was clearly inevitable he doubts whether american voters are going to elect a one term a guy who has served for four years in the senate and added i dont recall hearing a word from barack about a plan or a tactic

7109807 the girls were absolutely great everything went perfect there were clear figures first class choreography interesting transitions faultless synchronisation and each number was executed at a high speed this was a real show of olympic champions
7109808 this was evident for example in the case of chinese marksmen who were accommodated right next to the firing ranges if you wanted to put in a few practice shots at night no one stopped you from going onto the range and putting in a few everybody would have loved to have such a privilege but shooting was only one example i can assure you that the most favoured nation status applied to several other lines of sport as well

7109880 canadians will like the fact that both of them are opposed to the war in iraq
7109881 theyll like the fact that theyre both knowledgeable about world affairs theyll like that obama and biden will take a multinational approach and not an our way or the highway approach to international issues
7109882 the idea that we are not willing to take the prime minister of canada and the president of mexico to the mat to make this agreement work is just a lack of presidential leadership
7109883 certainly obama and biden will take a more aggressive approach to increasing fuel efficiency for automobiles thatll be tough on the auto industry but they can do it and generally they favour a more aggressive approach on environmental regulation
7109884 so right at the top of the ticket you have someone who brings significant expertise in areas that concern canadians

7109893 blake wrote the marriage of heaven and hell if i have written of their divorce this is not because i think myself a fit antagonist for so great a genius nor even because i feel at all sure that i know what he meant but in some sense or other the attempt to make that marriage is perennial the attempt is based on the belief that reality never presents us with an absolutely unavoidable either or that granted skill and patience and above all time enough some way of embracing both alternatives can always be found that mere development or adjustment or refinement will somehow turn evil into good without our being called on for a final and total rejection of anything we should like to retain this believe i take as a disastrous error you cannot take all luggage with you on all journeys on one journey even your right hand and your right eye may be among the things you have to leave behind
7109894 wretched man that i am who will deliver from this body of death
7109895 thanks be to god through jesus christ our lord so then i myself serve the law of god with my mind but with my flesh i serve the law of sin

7109904 als er weer orgels bij zijn ervoor zorgen dat jonge kleine spelers zichtbaar zijn

7109933 west palm beach is second and tampa bay is in the top three top four sites in the country the scene in tampa is not big but its there wakeboarding a lot of its tricks originated in south florida and pretty much all of the top wakeboarders live in south florida

7109940 i wanted people to have a thought i mean they might hate it they might consider it a blight like graffiti or they might take it as a positive
7109941 i had no idea id be putting up a sign in greensburg
7109942 i got out there saw the devastation and thought wow if any place ever needed love its greensburg so i hammered up a sign and i liked the way it felt hammering that thing up so i hammered up a few on the way back in on the highway too when i got back i just started hammering around wichita
7109943 i got busted several times by people in the neighborhood
7109944 theyd ask me you know what are you doing one of my neighbors here across the road said are you having a garage sale i totally lied to him and told him it was for a scavenger hunt

7109956 no home will be allowed that costs less than 7 500
7109957 it is not merely the best in the middle west
7109958 there were throngs of people a big searchlight a band and music everybody milling around and streaming in and out of the brightly lighted shops along the l shaped midway
7109959 i really enjoy the cases where we can find normal causes for what the homeowner thinks is something scary
7109960 thats why i do it so they can feel comfortable in their home again
7109961 ive experienced shadow people voices full blown apparitions unexplainable noises lights coming on and off
7109962 every time weve come here weve picked up some sort of activity
7109963 but at the same time we have to wonder if it is just something we dont understand right now
7109964 monsieur nicolas sarkozy viendra maill le lundi 25 ao t 2008 il honorera la m moire des 124 victimes du 25 ao t 1944 en d posant deux gerbes et proc dera linauguration de la maison du souvenir

7109966 i wouldnt want to get anywhere near your toilet tonight
7109967 chelsea fc have agreed terms for andriy shevchenko to return to ac milan
7109968 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i believe that in the past two years he has realized that this is his home
7109969 now he has made his financial sacrifices but at this point the only thing that matters is that he returns to us
7109970 we succeeded in bringing home the player who in the last 50 years has scored the most goals in our shirt
7109971 president silvio berlusconi and i am happy as is our coach and i believe also our players
7109972 limiting losses in tough times has also helped the funds long term returns as it has less ground to make up when markets move higher
7109973 its that chasm that lies between knowing something and doing something about it
7109974 we get hundreds of inquiries about this every couple of weeks
7109975 its better if shes not writing the check directly to me to pay back her brother even though she is
7109976 worthy borrowers used to have lots of options but those have dried up
7109977 he really hasnt been himself so were going to give him a couple starts down in triple a just to see if he can get his mechanics back together
7109978 played catch yesterday afternoon with pitching coach john farrell for about 10 minutes
7109979 he threw the ball pretty well we just want to make sure we do the right thing
7109980 fighting in kashmir has claimed the lives of between 30 000 and 60 000 people
7109981 our aggressive military activities in afghanistan are foolish and wrong were going to have to leave the place or therell be nothing left of us or of whatever weve done except the blood weve lost there after we leave so its better we leave now
7109982 every thing is what it is and not another thing
7109983 the nhl and nhlpa have more or less agreed to overlook whats written in the cba at least until theres a clear direction on whats going to happen in terms of a new transfer agreement or lack thereof
7109984 1 the cba is amended to include a provision for how long european draft picks rights can be retained 2 at the point the direction of the nhls transfer relationship with the khl and other european countries is determined a deadline could be set for nhl teams to sign their picks whose rights would have expired under the two year window specified by the current cba 3 they could simply continue the status quo which essentially readopts the old system in which nhl teams could hold european players rights more or less in perpetuity
7109985 and it is not only the leaving cert results which should serve as a wake up call the most recent oecd survey ranked irish teenagers 16th in maths out of 30 member countries in overall english literacy tests by contrast irish teenagers regularly take one of the top three places a mid table ranking in maths is simply not good enough for a country investing heavily in science technology and innovation even at third level academics tell of students some with higher level leaving cert maths who have a poor grasp of mathematical concepts and an inability to apply the knowledge they do have outside practised routine situations
7109986 it was high time and i expected this negotiation to come to a happy ending by yesterday
7109987 its been complicated but now that everythings sorted im absolutely delighted
7109988 andriy made a mistake in leaving and i think that in these two years he has understood that milan is his home
7109989 i think in the first half in midfield we were dominated
7109990 we were not strong enough not quick enough and we suffered in there
7109991 i think when you want to play at the top you have to start the game in a different way than we did and have more personality and authority and that is where we were punished today
7109992 i believe that fulham started stronger than us and were quicker in the game and that corner that we didnt defend very well and then on i feel in the second half it was all us if you look at the number of shots they had
7109993 in fairness credit to them they were always sharp motivated defended very well but they didnt create enough chances to really win the game
7109994 i think it is ours to lose the game but it is fair to say fulham played well
7109995 i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7109996 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7109997 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7109998 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7109999 i mean you got the first sort of mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
