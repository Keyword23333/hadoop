3020163 releasing specific details about verification processes can undermine the effectiveness of the departments compliance arrangements

3020166 such a law would simply allow rich people to employ lawyers in a bid to avoid scrutiny of their wrongdoing
3020167 that matter is not a priority for me but it is something that i will speak to my cabinet colleagues about
3020168 comparing like schools with like schools to measure differences in school results
3020169 were not talking about anything as simplistic and silly as league tables
3020170 but we are talking about parents and the community understanding what kinds of students are in schools their socio economic status the number of indigenous students the number of students with disabilities because that obviously means the schools have special needs
3020171 the aim should be to robustly ascertain what mix of capacities and needs children are bringing to their school
3020172 we need this information in order to understand what schools in turn should offer to these students and how governments and communities working together can support schools to do so
3020173 as a nation we should then be tracking attainment knowing that we are in the powerful position of comparing like schools with like schools if two schools have comparable school populations but widely varying results we would be able to ask the question why and ascertain the answer
3020174 we should be able to identify best practice and innovation and work systematically to ensure that they are spread more widely we should be able to especially assist those schools that need it specifically we should be identifying excellent teaching and excellent school leadership we must expect high standards of every child
3020175 there is considerable concern with proposals to excessively tag students and schools with various labels for little purpose
3020176 nsw is responsible for the welfare and education of its students and is committed to the constructive application of the outcomes of assessment in all its forms
3020177 its like hospitals its the rules around that ranking because if youre going to stand in a hospital and its a similar example with schools like westmead and compare it for example with a small district hospital like canterbury and then attempt in some way from the straight statistics that appear on that list to rank those two hospitals you would not be comparing like with like
3020178 public schools nationwide require an immediate 1 4 billion per annum to raise retention rates to 90 per cent and a further 1 3 billion per annum to ensure that all primary school age children reach the minimum benchmark scores for literacy and numeracy

3020205 the decision to suspend enrollment in this clinical trial is based solely on the results reported in a recently published study comparing laser treatment and intravitreal injections of ta
3020206 we believe the data from the phase i and phase iib clinical trials generated to date provide support for the tolerability profile of i vation ta and more generally that of the i vation sustained delivery platform

3020255 we feel he owes us at least a season of loyalty
3020256 we took him from arsenal reserves and made him an international player
3020257 although we do accept from his point of view he has given us two years excellent service and it wasnt his fault that we were relegated
3020258 we feel its not the right time to sell him from the clubs point of view we hope in due course he realises we are being entirely reasonable
3020259 we have the highest respect for him that is why weve offered him a new contract doubling his money despite the fact that hes got two years left on his existing contract and we have a two year option at the end of his existing contract
3020260 we fully accept that there are two sides to any dispute but we feel we are entitled to one more year of commitment from the player

3020275 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3020276 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3020277 this is a planning took where all things are going
3020278 the idea just came from the fact that there was something that needed to be told we had a story to tell its about life in sheffield at the end of the 80s on the dole and going climbing it is about having something you are passionate about but at the same time at a time when there is high unemployment and you have to grow up relationships marriage and all that
3020279 we were actually in the alps climbing and were waiting for the weather to clear so i hired a bike and a map and set off it was black route but i figured i was pretty tough i was carrying this heavy bike up the worst trail ever thinking i was reasonably fit and there was still no way i would be able to ride up this only then noticed the lift and realised how things work out here that its automated going up and you ride down
3020280 we were all keen mountain bikers but the fact was that you could rarely tell on a map what would translate to be a good track for mountain biking
3020281 i ended up with ordnance survey maps covered in highlighter pen working out a way of linking everything together
3020282 i lived here but there were still so many places that i didnt know so it was awesome if you go out with friends you tend to do the same loops but here i was discovering every corner id head out and spoke to loads of people in the area i ended up with ordnance survey maps covered in highlighter pen working out a way of linking everything together
3020283 if you want to go out and see the wildlife and be on your own then i would recommend the white peak but if you are with your mates i would recommend the dark peak my all time favourite i guess is win hill out of hope just because it is on my doorstep and i can go out in an evening with my night lights and see all the wildlife and know every inch
3020284 the first time i did high street on helvelyn was so memorable because i was up in the lakes with work
3020285 i havent done loads in the alps as i am usually there climbing but i will always take the time for a couple of routes on rest days
3020286 confidence is really the most important thing really these days most bikes will roll over a lot of stuff so it is just about having confidence if you are looking 20 yards down the hill you will be fine too many people dont have the faith in their bike and end up putting a foot down
3020287 i have always liked doing journeys whether it is going down caving or fell running its just so rewarding
3020288 its my forks honest they were bottoming out and are definitely near the end of their life
3020289 if you can take out demo bikes that is the ideal option but biking is definitely worth the investment sadly if you only spend 100 you really are not going to enjoy it if you can manage it spend as much as you can on your bike
3020290 i still really like the fact that you can have a bad day at work and go out on your bike and you just cover so much ground that by the time you are back it is like it has totally absorbed you i have always liked doing journeys whether it is going down caving or fell running its just so rewarding

3020308 the new stadium is wonderful its top class i wish i had played in such a stadium during my heyday
3020309 on 3 may 2006 a day after orlando stadium celebrated its 47th anniversary we stood at almost this exact spot when we handed her the old lady to the contractors
3020310 on that day we marked the city of johannesburgs ground breaking movement towards the first 2010 project to be initiated by the city
3020311 when we announced that orlando stadium would be demolished and reconstructed we had a vision of what the new stadium would look like and what it would mean to the community of greater orlando
3020312 the community at large has benefited from this development through the jobs that have been created
3020313 to date 2 205 jobs have been created and training is being provided in the fields of carpentry bricklaying plastering and painting
3020314 the act deals effectively with the plight of older persons by establishing a framework to empower and protect older persons and at the promotion and maintenance of their status well being safety and security
3020315 we want our communities to treat the older person fairly and equitably and as a department we are committed to protect the older person from unfair discrimination on any ground including on the grounds of the health status or disability of the older person
3020316 on the supply side the reduction of unplanned maintenance has been kept below 250 megawatts per day and eskom coal stockpiles have increased from just less than 13 days in january this year to about 19 days in june

3020321 the construction sector is a competitive and high risk business for both clients and the industry
3020322 the industry is mobile and every project brings together new combinations of technology and resources of professional discipline of contractors and subcontractors skilled and unskilled workers plant and equipment
3020323 cooperation between government and sector organisations in providing skills and opportunities for women contractors is critical to ensure that women continue to claim their share of this industry by gaining skills and critical knowledge
3020324 our interventions will have to be strengthened and vigorously implemented in order to ensure that women contractors do not remain static small time plays in the construction space

3020359 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3020360 the countrys still pretty divided people may want a divided government they want change but im not sure that the democratic agenda has the support of a majority of americans
3020361 ive watched the blogs try to say that you cant trust obama because he spent a little bit of time in a secular madrassa
3020362 i feel quite opposite i think its a tremendous strength whether hes in the united states senate or whether hes in the white house
3020363 i had a guy shoot a gun next to me thats how bad it was the guy shot two shots i ran home it was terrifying this was bad i never thought i would see this in my life
3020364 usually its quiet though theres never nothing bad this is bad
3020365 i thought i would see this only on tv never in real life
3020366 we faced young people who knew their territory so they went inside buildings around buildings
3020367 were there to listen to understand what happened yesterday sunday night and to avoid these kinds of situations
3020368 a little further down the road there were two fires and the kids were massacring our town
3020369 i turned my head and saw a big burst of fire next to my car
3020370 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3020371 the struggle against terrorism is not in the villages of afghanistan
3020372 the only result of the use of airstrikes is the killing of civilians this is not the way to wage the fight against terrorism

3020374 new orleans own eyehategod have served up 20 years and 7 albums of original painful and misanthropic feedback laden hardcore blues to an ever increasing doomed climate of world wide despair and degradation and have absolutely managed to have fun doing it multiple tours of europe the usa and even japan have seen these southern gentlemen preaching the end time message and influencing new generations of hedonistic roustabouts to spread their rock n roll nihilism since 1988 the band will play at one eyed jacks on the 3rd anniversary of katrina friday august 29th with crowbar and hellkontroll
3020375 i was at the biggest fucking metal show on earth
3020376 were pretty damn proud of it and we cant contain it any longer
3020377 i didnt think it was possible with 10 laps to go to tell you the truth
3020378 i knew darnell was going to be tough i had a really hard time passing the 30 of bodine he was running strong too then i saw bodine sliding around and i was able to get by him i worked on darnell and was able to get to victory lane
3020379 i was doing my best to keep johnny back there and held him off for a while as soon as he cleared bodine he ran right up there once benson got air on the nose that was it i held him off for a while but he got under me and that was it
3020380 it was a great points day for us but just as important it just continues to show how strong our team is we started out loose and wheel hopping but crew chief todd berrier made good pit calls and we kept getting the car better as the race went on add comment
3020381 we didnt quite hit the setup the way we wanted to but we had enough to stay with them we just couldnt race as hard as i wanted to but the race came our way
3020382 its a shame for jimmie johnson the 48 was just a rocket he probably had the pace to win but were here in victory lane and hes not
3020383 i told him several times he did not need to pass him to win the race
3020384 i called to him the last few laps what his interval was to second place i told him there was no use taking a chance
3020385 we were just a little off today but this crew worked hard and we brought home a top 10 finish i really couldnt push the car more than i was or i would have wrecked it and that would have been a worst case scenario
3020386 we had good strategy today some good calls by crew chief mike ford and the crew but our car wasnt quite there
3020387 i hear the big investment trusts are buying apelike electronics
3020388 he missed a week hes going to get a chance to play more and more we like our depth we like what we have
3020389 i thought it was a real good start for all our young backs particularly jacob
3020390 we know ladainian tomlinson is our goal line runner but he hester is a very good short yardage runner and end of the game runner thats where people lose sight of what michael turners role was jacob showed those qualities there was a third and 2 run he made honestly the style of the run was very very similar to what michael turner gave us
3020391 going on set for the first time i didnt sleep the whole night before because its a big deal for me
3020392 its my first american thing it was the lead there was a lot of pressure but good pressure it was something i was very excited about i couldnt sleep because i was so excited to start my first day at work
3020393 im just happy to be part of this musical boom
3020394 towards the end of the movie there was actually 2 000 kids standing with their cellphones in the air waving them as though it was a concert
3020395 simply didnt support prosecutors depiction of a hard core al qaeda terrorist who hates america and its way of life
3020396 message to the bush administration or comment on its military commission system
3020397 thoughtful and fair or as fair as a hopelessly flawed system could hope to produce
3020398 designed by the white house and its congressional enablers to guarantee convictions using evidence obtained by torture and secret evidence as desired
3020399 could anything happen at guantanamo that isnt a stunning rebuke or an embarrassing blow to the bush administration
3020400 we have found ourselves scratching our heads in anguished confusion about what exactly president bush is trying to achieve by trashing the constitution at guant namo bay

3020402 youve only got to look around the club since he was appointed everyone will tell you how hard he works
3020403 i think there could be another couple of signings coming in
3020404 its no secret we need a back up keeper and it wouldnt surprise me if we look at another centre half as well
3020405 i would like to go in and meet with president barack obama
3020406 i would like to go in and meet with president barack obama

3020410 seven generations of the tolkowsky family have played important roles in the diamond world and embody the history of this exceptional stone not least the diamond genius marcel tolkowsky inventor of the ideal cut as a consequence of these milestones the tolkowsky family name symbolises pure perfection as well as absolute and exceptional quality and brilliance inherent in all cut by tolkowsky diamonds today jean paul tolkowsky continues the family legacy
3020411 like many others we saw the adverts from h amp a cutting works an affiliate of excel co sightholder which buys diamonds directly from the mines in various newspapers
3020412 they were looking for 30 batswana apprentices to be trained in thailand and later to return to teach others
3020413 our factory in thailand is one of the leading diamond factories in the world
3020414 it has one of the highest achievements in fine diamond cutting anywhere our vision is to recreate this centre of excellence in botswana
3020415 on february 19 2007 i was told i had been selected and asked to bring my passport for visa arrangements to be done in pretoria and to be present at a pre departure gala dinner at mmokolodi nature reserve to be hosted by none other than lior kunstlre partner to jean paul tolkowsky
3020416 the thai 20 pioneers of the diamond industry in botswana
3020417 kunstler bragged that he was going to change these kids lives forever khuto continues
3020418 we were awestruck we all believed ourselves to be on the threshold of a great opportunity the nucleus of botswanas diamond beneficiation programme we were going to be at the forefront of cutting grading and polishing
3020419 it stated that we would receive a p600 monthly allowance and that employment upon completion was not guaranteed
3020420 but we didnt allow that to dampen our spirits because we reasoned the pula was five times stronger than the thai baht besides the company was to take care of our accommodation food and other basics
3020421 i took up the issue of no guarantee of employment with the managing director for botswana samuel mothibi who told me not to worry about that it is just a formality
3020422 we left botswana on february 21 flying to johannesburg where we caught a connecting flight to abudabi in the united arab emirates whence we flew on to bangkok
3020423 we were to be trained at gemopolis estate an industrial zone of bangkok that is all about gems at the h amp a cutting works thailand factory
3020424 the factory had a room known as the botswana room a mini factory with all the trappings of a diamond firm
3020425 how much you learnt depended on how much english you could teach your teacher
3020426 we learnt that in the land of the bhudda blasphemy could land the perpetrator in jail we were told that because thailand was a conservative society we should be careful not to insult the bhudda
3020427 i am now sponsoring myself in a different course there are less than 10 of our group left there now
3020428 among these are a 100 percent medical aid scheme meal allowances and gratuity paid in line with the labour laws of botswana
3020429 the technical director claes kept telling us we were making progress
3020430 he wanted the factory in botswana to outclass the one in thailand he would tell us that these thai guys want to sabotage the botswana project which caused sowed a fair amount of discord even among us
3020431 claes actually told me that he was not a fool and that he would have some keep tabs on others the two representatives we had chosen were turned against us and were actually spying on us one morning claes told me that he had been told that i nurtured a fantasy socialist dream
3020432 we had a meeting with him and i told him of the challenges we were facing
3020433 i was soon called to a hearing for causing trouble by merely telling the minister that we were not happy once again claes told me that he was watching and that i should know that he was the one to choose who to employ
3020434 the trainees were advised not to wait for a third party before raising any issues they may have our staff are the most important resource we have there was no hearing of any sort following the ministers visit
3020435 a room for 20 was now being used by 60 people even the thai instructors were complaining they embarked on a go slow which resulted in redeployments and demotions
3020436 we were also chastised for allowing ourselves to be influenced by the thai way of doing things
3020437 the thai government does not allow foreigners who are not professionals to work in gemopolis a tax free zone and the factory had no training school
3020438 i asked him after reading the thai immigration act and told him that strictly speaking we were illegal immigrants
3020439 that falls within my mandate and not that of the technical director
3020440 the visas had to be renewed every three months as an immigration requirement mainly because we were pioneers in the kingdom of thailand in conducting such a training exercise
3020441 at no stage was anyone concealed from the authorities even the minister of mineral resources energy and water resources the honourable mr p kedikilwe came to visit the trainees that is not something that can be concealed
3020442 the aim is to have diamond experts but our people are only being taught to be labourers in the industry all we do is stand for 10 hours cutting and polishing until we develop hunchbacks like some of those thai workers and that for p800 a month it is sad
3020443 we have had to take hard decisions like parting with those that chose not to believe in our dream but to become unruly instead
3020444 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3020445 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
3020446 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
3020447 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
3020448 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
3020449 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
3020450 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake
3020451 parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
3020452 if there were no proper control here blood leaving the mothers blood vessel would trigger release of serotonin platelets would aggregate vessels constrict and the fetus wouldnt get what it needs
3020453 we believe that 80 percent of women experience postpartum blues because of this effect of interleukin 1 beta if our hypothesis holds true lowering interleukin 1 beta levels may be a better treatment option
3020454 we enroll women who are without housing who are living from place to place we often see women who are medically high risk in combination with social and environmental challenges
3020455 tentativo di cambiare la costituzione siriana incitamento alla ribellione armata e diffusione di informazioni false
3020456 chops up all the oxygen particles in the air leaving none to breathe
3020457 we saw it as a tool to help us with retention and recruitment
3020458 this definitely is something that has helped with our stature in the community and with our competitiveness
3020459 executives realize that if employees are stressed out financially have excess debt it really makes them less productive
3020460 theres a real financial benefit to the company a long term financial benefit for their employees to be on track for retirement and financially fit
3020461 er moeten nog een paar liedjes ingezongen worden en dan is het helemaal klaar
3020462 deze week duik ik de studio weer in met mijn bandje waar ik me enorm op verheug
3020463 doordat ik twee maanden in afrika heb vertoefd voor de film wit licht heb ik weinig gezongen
3020464 een stemband is gewoon een spier in je lichaam welke getraind moet worden dat heb ik weer volop gedaan en het loopt weer gesmeerd
3020465 het voorkomen van huiselijk geweld is een van de speerpunten van het justitiebeleid
3020466 plannen is een groot woord we kunnen momenteel leven op het terrein maar we moeten zien wat er gaat gebeuren als we aan het gebouw vast blijven zitten tot nu toe hebben we steeds oplossingen gevonden voor onze expansie maar het oude gebouw moet weg voor verdere groei
3020467 we zijn een wereldwijde organisatie en kunnen ons overal vestigen
3020468 niet alle bouwsels zijn weg we zijn nog bezig met de afronding van het traject
3020469 de beweging is al lange tijd aanwezig en dat levert zeker het een en ander op
3020470 every time you go look for something new and its not there youre wasting valuable time
3020471 with the economy suffering and prices for gas food healthcare and education climbing higher every day new mexicans need a leader in the united states senate who will put our interests first
3020472 always do right by new mexico in the united states senate

3020478 thamess customers have enjoyed the lowest bills in the industry for many years but we now need to make essential investment to secure their services for the future
3020479 it is a shame that some of our partners are not helping us but essentially are hindering us
3020480 i mean the transfer by the united states of a georgian contingent in iraq with military transport planes practically to the conflict zone
3020481 the very scale of this cynicism is astonishing the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3020482 the axiom honest men have nothing to fear from the police is currently under review by the axioms appeal board

3020488 the failure to plan and successfully implement liquid box office indicates a fundamental lack of relevant expertise amongst board members this has resulted in the fringe society reaching a point of potential financial ruin
3020489 hundreds of thousands of tickets have been sold and the fringe society is financially secure more importantly many fringegoers are out enjoying shows

3020492 you put the ball on the ground you have to run and thats the way when we talked about it he wanted it and thats the way i wanted it
3020493 its more of a team unity thing nick and i ran it i told eric day 1 that unless i pass out i am going to try to do everything that everyone else does
3020494 im no different aside from being a little gray headed and a little bit older
3020495 you get used to a new guy and it takes a little bit of time and usually you get the luxury of doing it in the spring where no ones really around or cheering for laps
3020496 i need to call my mom and have her tape espn
3020497 hopefully i got on there today with a penalty lap it was weird because its a penalty lap and youre running it because youve done something wrong and people are cheering it was a little different
3020498 you have to get used to a guys voice his placement of his hands how quickly hes getting out you try to make it look as effortless as possible
3020499 i think its kind of funny but yet serves its purpose i think things like that are important in the fact that everyone is involved in it
3020500 when you come out here and the fans are going crazy and having fun it just helps you get through the day
3020501 weve just got to make sure were handling everything around him so we have the chemistry we need to have before the season starts
3020502 the ball comes out hard and fast and straight and long so thats always good
3020503 its been a whirlwind for him and theres a lot of new information going in were progressing quickly
3020504 until i can see the cadence and see the mechanics
3020505 brett had his two hard boiled eggs a little bit of orange juice
3020506 there was a garnish i think and some hashbrowns and i can take you through minute by minute after that
3020507 it was an original idea from gordon and there has been a substantial personal contribution from him
3020508 he has approached several archbishops and other religious leaders for their views and ian rankin j k rowling and sir george martin are among the other contributors
3020509 its quite a wide list and the book is meant to reflect on the diversity of what it means to be british in the modern day
3020510 today its an amazing fact that 50 of scots have close relatives in england so it seems strange that people are talking of splitting up when theres such a level of connection at a human level at a family level with england
3020511 then youve got to look at what holds us together people say the empire the benefits of industrialisation the war years that we went through together i dont think thats the case
3020512 i think we share the same values about liberty about democracy about the need for social cohesion and for people to work together co operatively
3020513 i think we share respect for similar institutions like the health service
3020514 i wouldnt like to see health care denied to a scot in england or to an english person in scotland
3020515 i think the principle of the health service we all accept is the right to health care in any part of the united kingdom the right to work in any part of the united kingdom the right to attention no matter which part of the united kingdom you live in
3020516 i get up early and write first thing in the morning
3020517 i type with two fingers it can be as unintelligible as my hand writing
3020518 for poor old gordon brown this may be too little too late
3020519 his britishness campaign has always been about him trying to sell himself to people south of the border especially middle england
3020520 i thought it was a very good game and im glad we were able to pull out the win
3020521 all their shooters have nba range we had to make sure we got out on them
3020522 well eoin i think you guys have to let padraig off the hook here
3020523 now you guys have to remember the only guy in the world these days who wins back to back majors in the same year is rehabbing down in his mansion in florida mortals just dont win back to back majors it takes too much luck too many good breaks too much concentration and too much effort for a guy who just played his guts out and left it all on the course at birkdale just three weeks ago
3020524 thats tigers territory so come on lads lets be real padraig can be quite pleased with his major triumph set his sights on the ryder cup and call it a great year
3020525 but why gary hes just hit the paintwork with his shot before he can go for it
3020526 nick the front of this green rolls right back down weve seen so many guys in the water today its unbelievable
3020527 i dont know what he was trying to do there
3020528 it is not possible for me to stay there at the village
3020529 i cant escape the other athletes want pictures and everything i dont mind it but its every day it is not ideal preparation for trying to win a gold medal
3020530 it is a pleasure to see and spend time with athletes from all over the world
3020531 people recognize me and if they ask me for a photo i just do the photo it is no problem for me to do that they are all athletes i am excited to be here the same as them
3020532 it is different here because it is only every four years so you feel the pressure
3020533 it would mean as much to win the gold medal as a grand slam and i couldnt ask any more than to have started like this
3020534 roger has been dominating everyone for four years and now nadal is beating everyone
3020535 i have to first off all thank my little boy pietro who is waiting for me
3020536 i always gave my heart and soul to this sport
3020537 s skal vi til at st til ansvar for jesus
3020538 jeg har feber idag men jeg skal p job de regner med mig
3020539 i know nothing about the video and have only seen the photos yes it looks like its really her but it is ridiculous to think it was me who put them there
3020540 we can just have it downstairs for awhile it doesnt have to be up in his room so i dont need to get another tv at the moment if i just get the basic wii with a couple extra controllers and one game its not that bad we are hardly home to play anyway so having it on the main tv wont be that much of a conflict just for a few months right plus its for all of us so its better if its downstairs yeah ok
3020541 customers need to make many key decisions during any datacentre project and they do not always have the necessary information to guide them many of their concerns are not addressed by configuration tools because they occur early in the concept selection process with the introduction of apcs tradeoff tools when a roadblock arises the data centre decision maker can easily find a tool to deal with their specific issue get a quick answer and continue on in the concept selection process
3020542 customers are increasingly seeking network independent resilient data centres to provide secure hosting and connectivity services the continued growth of the internet economy and the evolving online needs of business both locally and internationally are combining to drive the increase in demand for high quality data centres
3020543 we were putting too big a demand on the sun servers which were between six and seven years old and they could not take it anymore
3020544 corporate enterprises are tightening their spending belts while searching for alternative anywhere application environments that increase cost efficiencies and without sacrificing capability or performance
3020545 organizations need not look any further than the virtualization market for the appropriate solution thanks to the rapid commoditization and intensified competition in this market a price war has emerged making it departments the true winners in this battle
3020546 it is obvious he has a grave dislike of women
3020547 at the scene of the attack police officers arrested a 26 year old local man who was taken to hastings police station
3020548 he will be interviewed about this and other similar attacks in hastings being investigated within operation medium he has not been charged as yet
3020549 the willingness of this man to use unprovoked violence against women is a great concern and we urgently need to find the man responsible we know the man is white probably in his twenties or thirties with dark hair and he may have a muscular build
3020550 i would say i spent most of my life in them right up until the time ive had one of my own to operate working for the family spas and engaging the culture of experts that have surrounded me for my entire career i was able to take everything that i learned and provide services in a luxurious atmosphere that is unique for cleveland
3020551 the idea was jojos to forge an association of artists from around the world who would meet to exchange ideas and to educate each other in a noncompetitive format
3020552 its the kind of thing that just wouldnt happen today these events were not sponsored by products companies or manufacturers like they would be today it was an arrangement that created a welcoming environment for pure unadulterated education and artistry
3020553 it was a great situation and the caliber of people who got together to do these incredible stage shows and educational events was the exception and not the rule
3020554 some of the people involved didnt even have their own products or companies going at the time right now with the way the industry is you couldnt do what the art amp fashion group did without having your own products and sponsorship it was very cutting edge and done purely for the joy of the profession it was incredible and inspiring i had a lot of very good teachers
3020555 when our guests come to the spa we really want them to forget about everything and want them to indulge in feeling pampered
3020556 pamper our customers in a sanctuary that exceeds their every expectation
3020557 at a location like this we have people who come on their lunch breaks and after work
3020558 we have a lot of people from downtown business locations and w e have a lot of patrons come in from the suburbs for a full day or partial day of treatments with dining and entertainment comprising the rest of their downtown experience
3020559 with the hyatt and arcade serving as a location for a lot weddings our phenomenal staff of hair artists here at the spa do a great deal for wedding parties as well weddings can be stressful and we like to provide an escape from that pressure
3020560 i love to be pampered and spoiled as most people do
3020561 we like to keep things here intimate and unhurried helping our customers find that ultimate retreat they need i always find time to have services myself because i think the relaxation and revitalization is essential to keeping yourself healthy and for people who havent been here the added bonus of being in the beautiful arcade we feel that the spa is a gem in the middle of downtown and close to everything which adds to the retreat feeling
3020562 whether its an herbal wrap and aromatherapy or one of our signature massages im a firm believer in spa services and i am such a firm believer because i experience the treatments we offer first hand
3020563 we want to treat everyone to a unique and wonderful experience thats really what we aspire to here weve tried to create the most luxurious environment combined with the most knowledgeable staff in order to pamper our guests with head to toe relaxation and physical enhancement
3020564 well you know what the interest is going to be on the income from bond money before its expenditure on construction
3020565 why cant the financial guy respond he knows the numbers
3020566 it does mean you are expending a billion dollars of public money arent you arent you
3020567 we are very happy to report that we are very pleased with our recommendation and very confident and comfortable with the results

3020579 we are giving space and time to the provinces first the provincial assemblies are moving their own resolutions we must give them that time they must occupy that space today
3020580 actually the leadership wants that instead of being impeached by the parliament if he himself resigns then that will be comparatively advisable for him
3020581 impeachment can be long and drawn out it can lead to confrontations within the political arena that i do not think pakistan can afford i think that it can also raise issues that are best not discussed in the political arena i think it would be very hard to have a smooth process of impeachment
3020582 coalition troops called in close air support to engage the militants hiding in the structure they did not have knowledge of non combatants in the buildings at that time
3020583 survivors reported that coalition aircraft dropped a bomb on the enemy position which killed eight of the civilians
3020584 an anonymous eyewitness told coalition forces that the civilians tried to escape the compound but the militants beat them and refused to let them leave
3020585 a convoy of vehicles was attacked by a suicide bomber i believe it hit one of the vehicles in the convoy it is an armoured vehicle
3020586 he was part of the initial regulation and encouragement to grow the american merchant fleet
3020587 we know that because all of our students are required to memorize a saying that he has which goes you can have a first class merchant marine with first class men even if they sail second class ships but second class men cant be trusted on the finest ships afloat
3020588 what he was saying was it was important to invest in the education and in the training of merchant mariners of the officers who go to sea
3020589 so for all those good reasons the academy was overjoyed at the opportunity to honor the kennedy family by naming the training ship after the kennedys
3020590 we have 1 200 young men and women in training going through college this will be a daily constant reminder of both the public service that the kennedys are famous for and also their love of the sea

3020602 this complicated network of causation has confounded efforts to understand cd says carol nacy ph

3020604 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3020605 we are finding that breastfeeding rates arent just explained by the individuals who live in these areas theres something about the areas themselves and breastfeeding
3020606 its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3020607 we need to design nanorectifiers that go with our nanoantennas
3020608 its exciting because weve found a compound in nature that may one day surpass a currently marketed drug or could become the structural template for rationally designed drugs with improved selectivity
3020609 the ocean is a genetically distinct environment and the single most diverse source of new molecules to be discovered
3020610 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
3020611 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
3020612 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
3020613 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
3020614 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
3020615 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
3020616 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
3020617 we know that testosterone makes males more susceptible to disease
3020618 we wanted to find out if it impacts their behavior as well and how that increases their ability to transmit disease
3020619 our plan was to raise the testosterone levels in wild mice and measure the disease risk they posed to the population
3020620 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
3020621 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
3020622 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam

3020642 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3020643 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3020644 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3020645 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3020646 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3020647 i am very shocked i cannot see if we should live in this area any more

3020649 my study demonstrates that the prevailing view in corporate law that special litigation committees uniformly decide to dismiss derivative litigation against manager colleagues is not accurate
3020650 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3020657 she believes there needs to be a property based tax but there is still a lot of work needing to be done
3020658 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

3020895 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia

3020934 we want to bring it to the worlds attention that gaza is virtually an outdoor concentration camp
3020935 peace and security we discovered in south africa do not come through the barrel of a gun i support the boat convoy in its effort to bring humanitarian relief to the people of gaza
3020936 we want to break the siege of gaza we want to raise international awareness about the prison like closure of the gaza strip and pressure the international community to review its sanctions policy and end its support for continued israeli occupation we want to uphold palestines right to welcome internationals as visitors human rights observers humanitarian aid workers journalists or otherwise
3020937 we are these human rights observers aid workers and journalists we have years of experience volunteering in gaza and the west bank at the invitation of palestinians
3020938 but now because of the increasing stranglehold of israels illegal occupation of palestine many of us find it almost impossible to enter gaza and an increasing number have been refused entry to israel and the west bank as well despite the great need for our work the israeli government will not allow us in to do it

3020948 there are millions of individuals living in the u s with diabetes that take injections
3020949 when developing the survey we had two goals in mind the first was to encourage patients to take a more proactive role in communicating with their healthcare team about their concerns regarding insulin injections the second was to dispel the myth that healthcare providers were unaware of or were unwilling to address the quality of life issues surrounding insulin injections it is our hope that the results from this survey accomplish both these goals and that patients and providers will begin talking regularly about these important issues if we can improve the quality of life for 33 percent of people with diabetes who are insulin dependent then we can be one step closer to lessening the impact of the disease on our patients lives
3020950 diabetes is unique in that it requires significant commitment and adherence by the patient to keep it in control if patients are not comfortable communicating issues related to their quality of life over time they may adhere less and less to their regimen putting them increasingly at risk for complications
3020951 as this survey shows a percentage of individuals living with diabetes and taking insulin are altering what they eat during the day to avoid injections or even skipping the injection entirely even if that only happens rarely omission of insulin depending on the circumstance may have an impact on a patients overall health and potentially leave them at risk for serious diabetes related complications
3020952 i am not surprised that many people with diabetes are not talking with the doctors or diabetes educators about their injections
3020953 for years i skipped meals or injections to avoid the hassle and discomfort of taking them but when it came to talking with my doctor about it i did not speak up as much as i could have when i did finally talk to my diabetes educator about my injections i learned there were other less painful ways to manage my diabetes effectively i am so happy i finally said something
3020954 in this day and age i still get patients who believe that they developed diabetes from eating too much sugar
3020955 bad eating habits such as too much refined sugars empty carbohydrates and fructose does not cause diabetes
3020956 baby boomers who were raised with misconceptions about the disease may be at risk
3020957 the better the patient controls his or her blood sugar the less likely the more serious complications associated with diabetes will progress anyone already experiencing the side effects of diabetes needs to achieve and maintain the most stringent possible control in order to minimize their further progression
3020958 type 2 diabetes even pre diabetes is serious even if your blood sugar isnt that high
3020959 keep in mind you can have your cake and eat it too but if you want to eat something rich in carbs you will need to balance it out by cutting an equivalent amount of carbs or sugar from somewhere else in your diet
3020960 patients have a good deal more flexibility in their diets than they might suspect the rest is just a matter of care and moderation
3020961 this myth is dangerous because you can wind up in the hospital if you ignore symptoms of hyperglycemia which is hard to detect by the way you feel
3020962 making do without a regular blood glucose tests is like flying without a parachute or crossing the street with your eyes closed youre guessing learn your bodys signals when you get into trouble but be certain to use your glucose monitor to be sure
3020963 i still get patients who believe their lives are over once complications set it
3020964 the reality is that with the development of proper skills and mindset and the possession of monitoring equipment patients with diabetes can continue to live full lives even with severe complications many diabetics even insulin dependent live well into old age
3020965 pay attention to your body keep ahead of what your diabetes is doing for baby boomers this is no time for surprises consult with your doctor or your diabetes educator discuss exercise plans and any adjustment in medications with your doctor first

3020981 in addition if the company is able to identify incremental value or synergies in due diligence it will consider sharing that benefit with the republic stockholders
3020982 waste managements bid is in line with the 36 38 range where we think the company could execute an all cash bid for republic without issuing additional equity and maintain its investment grade debt rating

3021237 und wir haben nie einen zweifel daran gelassen dass ein solches auch privatwirtschaftlich zu f hren ist
3021238 wie auch andere kultureinrichtungen hat das birdland einen einmaligen baukostenzuschuss erhalten im damit verbundenen gemeinderatsbeschluss ist ausdr cklich festgehalten dass das birdland auf weitere betriebssubventionen seitens der stadt wien verzichtet das sollte eigentlich auch der vp bekannt sein die diesen beschluss mit ihrem vp kulturstadtrat federf hrend mitgetragen hat

3021285 elections in ghana are no longer a ghanaian affair because they will attract the attention of both friends and enemies of the country so we should not be naive to think that everybody wishes us well
3021286 it is unfortunate because the ghanaian society has been praised globally as a country where the rule of law and good governance has been entrenched
3021287 i am however glad the issue is already in the public domain and people are talking about it and frowning at it
3021288 any rule or regulation that does not have sanctions will be difficult to enforce enforcement of rules are part of the democratic process because you want to show that nobody is above the law

3021291 the school is still counting on the ghana education service ges to furnish and equip the building with all the necessary logistics
3021292 what is more pathetic is that since last year the school has not received any financial support from the university which it serves as a practical school to ucc because funds received by the university were not enough to complete the universitys own projects
3021293 it was only the pta which donated a 23 seater bus to the school 13 years ago which is presently nothing to write home about
3021294 beloved these are awesome days days of challenges and difficult decisions days of changes and new beginnings so let us join our hearts to form a strong network of caring and praying people and ask for a peaceful election

3021298 we believe more people will join the npp party if boniface is picked as a running mate he is widely respected by members of the opposition parties and religious leaders in the whole of ghana we all witnessed that over 100 ndc supporters defected to the npp just to support boniface to win the salaga seat for nana akufo addo
3021299 we believe that there is greatness in the passion of ghanaians for football and the english premier league and we urge all football fans to reach for that exhibition of greatness
3021300 this broadcast sponsorship ensures that the premiership matches featuring some of the most exciting african and international professional players will be available to a greater audience through satellite paid for and terrestrial or free to air television stations
3021301 guinness would also bring the broadcast of the english premier league to life especially in the favourite bars of consumers via the installations of gbs decoders and engage its loyal consumers in a number of exciting brand activities in bars where consumers show their loyalty to their english premier league club of choice and have the opportunity to predict score lines and win great brand souvenirs
3021302 guinness believes that there is greatness at all levels of football and in particular within the passion of ghanaian fans for the game and particularly the english premier league
3021303 we want to celebrate that greatness not just the greatness of the skills exhibited in singular matches but also in the entirety of the league most importantly we want to celebrate the greatness of the fans by giving them more opportunities to express their loyalty for individual clubs in the premiership
3021304 guinness is uniquely qualified to celebrate this greatness by showcasing this seasons english premier league through its positioning as a great and distinctive international brand
3021305 it is important to note that the survival of gt goes beyond just the capital as it is being speculated by a section of the public
3021306 we believe vodafone has the international clout in the telecom industry worldwide which gt can leverage on when it comes to international transactions and compete effectively with mtn zain glo tigo and kasapa which are all multinationals
3021307 otherwise by the time gt raises capital from the stock exchange as has been suggested by some people there will be no new customers to be acquired and even gts existing customers would have been taken over
3021308 gt cannot be sold every ghanaian must oppose this sale
3021309 it is unfortunate when people think the irresponsibility of government must necessitate the sale of a national asset as a solution rather than firing incompetent government appointees from office
3021310 is it not shameful to dissipate the assets of the state instead of creating more or even maintaining the little
3021311 if they did not intend any fraudulent act would they have included any indemnity clause in the likely event of causing financial loss to the state

3021348 taxpayers across the country are having trouble paying their taxes
3021349 as the economy continues to worsen and unemployment rates continue to increase thousands of families are falling too far behind on their taxes to ever fully repay their debts fortunately the irs offers settlement programs such as the offer in compromise where taxpayers can offer to settle their liability with one affordable lump sump payment
3021350 i had been dealing with irs problems for over a decade
3021351 for over a year the irs sent letters to me and eventually the irs assessed a penalty against me although i did not believe i was responsible for the debt they issued levies against my bank accounts and took every penny i had they left me broke sick and scared
3021352 in june 2001 i suffered a stroke i had been ill but i believe the irs harassment was the final straw when i suffered the stroke i lost my job my car everything i spoke with a few different tax advisors and one of them mentioned roni lynn deutch so i called the 800 number and finally asked for help i had total assistance and full support from everyone i spoke with at your law firm they were all so nice and helpful
3021353 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3021354 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem

3021383 my view is that the united states if we had a stronger relationship with russia we could exercise strong diplomacy to stop this effort against georgia we should immediately go to the united nations security council condemn russias action and then get the security council to pass a strong resolution getting the russians to show some restraint and possibly at the same time generate some u n peacekeeping troops the problem though is that we dont have the kind of influence and strength in our relationship with russia to persuade them this has been one of the failures of the bush administration failing to build a strong relationship a mutually beneficial relationship with russia so wed have the kind of influence to persuade them to stop some of these very very dangerous efforts within their territory
3021384 we are trying to stop this as soon as possible

3021400 it raised my eyebrows a bit when mississippi was selected
3021401 obviously there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits the group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for i dont know what dhs was looking for
3021402 we were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses
3021403 you told me more about the process than i know
3021404 i havent talked to anyone about it not to jay cohen or anyone
3021405 mississippis governor does not know of one dhs is in mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system
3021406 mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor
3021407 it appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers
3021408 this raises the question of whether dhs is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building
3021409 if any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process weve got a big problem on our hands

3021432 okay youre not feeling like it i get that but look there are so many reasons why you should do this lets make it fun lets set up rewards the final reward will be weight loss but what can we do in between to make this a positive experience
3021433 see you big loser i knew you couldnt do it why even bother

3021455 i think the most obvious reason that they made the announcement is just looking at the success of our console square has done games for us in the past and i think theres a point where square just has to look at the xbox 360 the install base and attach rates that were seeing and actually has to make a decision on their own that its the right thing to do for them i think its easy to assume that somethings going on behind the scenes i think the more obvious answer is were doing really well and the game creators want their games to be where the most people and the most consoles are and right now thats the xbox 360

3021480 i believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
3021481 we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win
3021482 at lufthansa the effects of the strike are particularly noticeable in the europe traffic region
3021483 although capacity still rose by 0 3 per cent this was considerably less than in prior months due to the strike traffic dropped by 3 1 percent compared with the previous year so that the load factor was also 2 5 percentage points lower at 73 3 per cent
3021484 the americas traffic region which is suffering from the economic downswing was particularly affected
3021485 however housing activity is definitely on a downward trend consistent with indications of deteriorating affordability through last year this factor is expected to keep new residential construction activity under pressure going forward our forecast assumes that starts will drop on average 5 3 per cent this year and 14 8 per cent next year

3021490 youve seen oil prices go down what is it 126 a barrel now i think this debate has everything to do with that
3021491 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3021492 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3021493 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3021494 youve seen oil prices go down what is it 126 a barrel now i think this debate has everything to do with that
3021495 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3021496 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3021497 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3021498 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3021499 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3021504 of course ecclestone turned down the offer but the article adds that he may yet be interested if he was offered full control of the circuit could the donington deal have been done to force the brdc into a position where they offer their prize asset over to ecclestone
3021505 belgian jules bianchi has had a reputation for being rather wild in his two seasons of car racing to date but on sunday he outshone his art formula 3 team mates to win the masters event at zolder the much talked about nico hulkenberg ended up second ahead of a third art car of jon lancaster
3021506 tottenham hotspur has become the first english premiership football club to join the superleague formula series which is due to start later this month at the donington park
3021507 talk of f1 races in mexicans is intermittent and in recent years has never seemed to be very serious there is nonetheless a long history of f1 in the country and good reasons for f1 to want to be there to help expand interest in the sport in the us timezone and attract the attention of the vast mexican population
3021508 i have been rather neutral on the refuelling issue but i slowly start to lean towards the ban
3021509 i cant however say that i agree with mike gascoynes ideas to ban the testing during the season and to extend the required life of the engines to more than 2 race weekends to autosport
3021510 in the days pre 1994 when you carried your entire race fuel load on board the car there was a much bigger role for the driver in managing the tyres and brakes
3021511 you could even opt to run non stop if you could make the tyres go the distance while someone else might pit twice
3021512 and because the cars weight changed so much more in the course of the race there were more fluctuations in performance and handling characteristics which in turn created more overtaking opportunities
3021513 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

3021515 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3021516 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3021517 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3021518 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3021519 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3021520 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3021522 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that

3021524 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3021525 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3021526 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3021527 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3021528 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3021529 of two young adults one of whom has down syndrome and is a survivor of leukemia
3021530 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3021531 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3021532 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3021533 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3021534 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3021535 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3021536 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3021537 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3021538 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3021539 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3021540 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3021541 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3021542 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3021543 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3021544 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3021545 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3021546 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3021547 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3021548 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3021549 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3021550 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3021551 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3021552 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3021553 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3021554 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3021555 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3021556 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3021557 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3021558 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3021559 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3021560 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3021561 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3021562 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3021563 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3021564 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3021565 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3021566 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3021567 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3021568 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3021569 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3021570 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3021571 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3021572 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3021573 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3021574 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3021575 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
3021576 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
3021577 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3021578 michaels not going to be able to walk right back into the nfl

3021581 when youve arrived ive opened my arms your mirth already yours to keep
3021582 the guys rowed a really disciplined race and stayed focussed in our boat
3021583 this is the first time the americans have raced so it would be very foolish to think that this is all theyve got they are not olympic champions for nothing
3021584 the canadians will be the challenge on sunday without a shadow of a doubt
3021585 id love to have won today but id have got it in the neck if id have gone harder through the middle
3021586 we found a better and more efficient rhythm so that we could sprint the last 250 metres
3021587 steering the candidates wealthy supporters away from independent democratic groups
3021588 its a brilliant move i think on the part of the campaign to get people to commit to the campaign weve really been putting ourselves out there and i think its really paid off
3021589 if you ask young people just coming into the political process right now about dean you get a blank face from them but his campaign was the beginning of my political career
3021590 young people should not have to choose between going to the latest arcade fire show and volunteering to canvass an apartment complex the two activities can be one and the same and when they are that creates a much lower threshold for someone to cross in order to engage in politics
3021591 music for america caught the first wave of venture funding that would provide the resources for the new progressive youth movement
3021592 obama cant and shouldnt be allowed to run the youth component of this campaign cycle alone his campaign needs the help of complimentary independent youth organizations to reach out to those non college voters and get them to the polls not just to secure his own election but for the election of down ballot candidates as well
3021593 as far as im aware all the youth voting groups put together havent secured more than 10 million toward their budgets in 2008
3021594 it wasnt a difficult choice to make coming here everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3021595 as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come to pompey
3021596 i came here because the manager has wanted me for two years i met him two years ago when i was at auxerre and i like the man because he gives you confidence
3021597 its a good opportunity for me because the club has a lot of ambition
3021598 i think pompey are a top five premier league side and i believe i can achieve what i want to achieve at this club
3021599 weve got the uefa cup as well and i want to go a long way in that
3021600 it does mean that there is a lot of competition for places but thats good it keeps everyone focussed
3021601 also i can play in midfield or at the back i dont mind really
3021602 georgia continues to use force and in this regard we cannot consider this document

3021608 the truth is jeff and i write how we write
3021609 everythings got to come out of real emotion we want to deal with issues and show consequences but not the issue of the week and pound you over the head
3021610 they were able to develop such a loyal fan base
3021611 this has the glitz of an aaron spelling show but at the same time gabe and jeff have taken it and given it a sense of humor they really flip it on its ear sometimes

3021621 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
3021622 because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
3021623 our legal team are going to be exhausting every possible channel for holding the police accountable for the draconian use of stop and search measures for the things they confiscated and for their violent incursions on to the camp
3021624 every year police use the supposed existence of a hardcore minority as justification for their heavy handedness and every year this hardcore minority fails to materialise

3021632 this will be my fourth year as an ice girl theres nothing more exciting than being able to interact with fans at the coliseum and all over long island
3021633 its a tribute to all of the work these ladies have brought to the ice and community knowing that we were the first nhl ice girl squad and so many nhl teams have followed our shining example

3021636 urgent action is needed now to kick start the housing market in shropshire which has been slowing for fifteen months but the labour government is dithering and their spin and speculation over stamp duty is further undermining the market by making buyers wait and see
3021637 before home information packs were introduced labour ministers ignored warnings from experts and industry that this new red tape would harm the housing market and the economy these warnings are coming true but ministers are more interested in saving face than saving homebuyers money
3021638 its been three years and we have hundreds of lots i honestly dont recall
3021639 mr ross did not contact or ask me to change anything
3021640 while researching his renkels complaint it became apparent that there was a lack of consistency in appraisals among identical often adjacent lots
3021641 the lower appraisals were on those lots still owned at the time by the developer
3021642 this is a mass appraisal program and all values are based on sales information collected during the years between appraisals as the assessor of property from 1980 to 2006 i strived to be fair and equal to all property owners
3021643 there was no supporting documentation for the reversals no record of appeals to the board of equalization and no sales data to support the lower valuations
3021644 i am sorry mr jenkins spent so much time researching this matter when a simple phone call would have answered these questions
3021645 it sounds as if the person who did it was using the practice of developer discounting
3021646 the state board of equalization has determined that there is nothing in the law that allows developer discounting
3021647 the law states that all property is to be taxed at fair market value
3021648 that money is not recoverable and that portion of the tax burden had to be redistributed among the rest of loudon countys taxpayers
3021649 im very glad mr jenkins investigated the way i look at it it should be illegal i think somebody should pay
3021650 we have scheduled quality teams that will challenge us as we prepare for our goals to become eiwa champions and place as many wrestlers as possible at the ncaa championships of course the ultimate goal is a national title and this schedule will prepare us to be in the hunt for that as well there is no question we will wrestle the best the country has to offer

3021653 ive seen plenty of disgusted and disgruntled parents come in with phone bills in the hundreds of dollars for their kids
3021654 and then theres the fact that kids will be kids they play rough with and lose their toys a phone will be no different
3021655 theres a huge difference between feeling safer and being safer
3021656 a cell phone is with the person who controls it and most parents dont check cell phones
3021657 we do not have enough information nor do we have enough time to be sure that cell phones are safe and theres reason for concern that they may be harmful
3021658 i was so busy with school and sports that i rarely used the phone

3021771 que son v ctimas de agresiones provenientes principalmente de autoridades estatales
3021772 una creciente autocensura en los medios de comunicaci n mexicanos como consecuencia directa de las t cticas de terror que han implementado las mafias y ante la desconfianza que existe sobre el accionar de las autoridades estatales y federales por su falta de respuesta o por su posible vinculaci n con el crimen organizado
3021773 la manipulaci n por parte de los gobiernos estatales y federales del presupuesto destinado a la publicidad oficial con los que se pretende orientar la informaci n as como la alta concentraci n de medios de comunicaci n en pocas personas o grupos empresariales vinculados a diferentes ramas de la econom a y con sectores con enorme poder pol tico empresarial y religioso
3021774 uno de los retos m s importantes a los que se enfrenta el gobierno mexicano la impunidad en los casos de asesinatos desapariciones y agresiones contra periodistas que representa una de las formas extremas de censura y que se recrudece cuando no existe castigo para los responsables
3021775 funcionarios de alto nivel del gobierno federal han declarado que existe voluntad pol tica para resolver los delitos cometidos contra periodistas sin embargo en los hechos se evidencia que han adoptado pocas medidas eficaces para atender la problem tica
3021776 m xico es uno de los pa ses m s peligrosos para periodistas en las am ricas en los ltimos ochos a os por lo menos 24 periodistas y trabajadores de los medios han sido asesinados ocho m s permanecen desaparecidos y decenas han sido amenazados intimidados o agredidos en raz n de su oficio la mayor a de las agresiones contra periodistas se encuentra en total impunidad lo que provoca un estado generalizado de autocensura

3021778 la situaci n no parece mejorar bajo el nuevo gobierno de felipe calder n desde enero de 2007 al menos ocho periodistas y trabajadores de los medios han ca do en el mismo per odo cuatro informadores han desaparecido cifra que se suma a los cuatro reporteros de quienes desde el 2000 se desconoce su paradero

3021781 la estrategia militar y policiaca de combate al crimen organizado que desarrolla el gobierno federal arroja ya ataques directos a comunicadores agentes de esas instituciones han amenazado agredido y detenido a periodistas locales injustamente
3021782 la actuaci n de las mafias y el m todo dise ado por las autoridades para enfrentarlas ha puesto en el escenario un nuevo riesgo para el trabajo informativo la estigmatizaci n oficial a la prensa
3021783 dicha estigmatizaci n de los medios de comunicaci n y de las personas que trabajan para fomentar la libertad de expresi n tuvo repercusi n directa sobre el trabajo de la misi n internacional el 21 de abril de 2008 en la reuni n que sosten an con juan de dios castro subprocurador de derechos humanos de la pgr el funcionario calific de enemiga del estado a aleida calleja periodista mexicana y vicepresidenta internacional de la asociaci n mundial de radios comunitarias amarc calleja le hab a preguntado a castro sobre el caso de las ind genas triquis teresa bautista y fel citas mart nez periodistas de la emisora comunitaria la voz que rompe el silencio de oaxaca asesinadas el pasado 7 de abril momentos antes castro hab a declarado ante la misi n que el rol de los periodistas es fundamental en la protecci n de una democracia
3021784 resulta alarmante que un funcionario de alto nivel del gobierno promueva una pol tica tan nociva para el ejercicio de la libertad de prensa como un paliativo contra la ineficacia del estado en el cumplimiento de sus obligaciones en materia de derechos humanos
3021785 la autocensura ha sido aceptada por funcionarios del gobierno federal y de los estados como consecuencia de la impunidad con la que se mueven los criminales por una justicia que no condena y la incapacidad del estado por dar garant as de seguridad al trabajo informativo

3021809 impact on the long iron shot weight is still on the left foot as it was in address and throughout the swing

3021826 we take the time to educate those who are around brianna
3021827 this includes the children in her classroom and their parents the entire staff in her school and the education community within our county we have found that most people know someone who has food allergies and want to learn as much as they can to keep that person safe

3021841 by acquiring i2 we double our addressable market in manufacturing to include discrete manufacturing complementing our current market leadership in process manufacturing and strengthening our retail and transportation management presence a major player in the supply chain space for more than 20 years i2s world class customers and employees are the perfect match for jda with the experience gained from the successful acquisition of manugistics in 2006 the addition of i2 is comparatively an incremental and logical step for jda
3021842 we are confident in our abilities to execute and deliver on projected synergies creating significant incremental shareholder value
3021843 in an industry that continues to consolidate scale matters in that regard the combination of these two companies will create one of the worlds strongest best of breed software solution providers focused on the global supply chain
3021844 the combination of i2 and jda increases the opportunity for expanded expertise accelerated innovation and even greater value delivery through the joining of some of the best solutions and brightest minds in the industry
3021845 in order to avoid equity dilution and maximize our shareholder value jda will finance the acquisition using debt credit suisse and wachovia will be financing the deal
3021846 consistent with our strategy after the manugistics acquisition we will use our significantly expanded cash flow from operations to de lever as quickly as possible

3021848 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3021849 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3021850 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3021851 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3021852 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3021853 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3021854 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3021855 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3021856 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3021857 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap

3021866 this month we have seen the highest annual price increase on the staples basket since april this year this indicates that shoppers need to keep an even closer eye on what theyre spending
3021867 shopping habits are changing consumers are more cash conscious and consequently despite the overall price increases there are a wide range of offers available in each store this means that discerning shoppers can beat these rises and be smart about the way in which they shop
3021868 it is clear that despite the impressive political energy and resources focused on education iod members believe the government has generally performed poorly in this critical arena there is a substantial credibility gap between what official statistics show and what employers feel on the front line
3021869 even at face value the official figures illustrate a need for a step change in performance to meet future skill needs
3021870 there is absolutely no doubt that english and maths standards have risen over the last decade results have risen and quality has been rigorously scrutinised by our independent exam regulators

3021873 the current national testing system is not set in stone as we said in the childrens plan there may well be changes
3021874 could be more flexible for schools more personalised for individual pupils and provide more scope for teacher assessment and professional judgment
3021875 this is why we are currently carrying out a pilot in 450 schools of stage not age tests which allow children to take shorter tests when they are ready rather than waiting until a fixed point at 11 or 14
3021876 im attracted to the testing when ready principle but ill only implement it following rigorous evaluation of whether it helps children make faster progress

3021899 a lot of people think this is going to have an impact on who the vp selection is going to be
3021900 you have to think of people who have foreign policy experience
3021901 i think one of the outsiders who would be a very interesting choice im not recommending this is senator sam nunn of georgia youd have to put new mexico governor bill richardson back on the list and obviously senator biden if obama wants to have two senators which im not sure is what he really wants to have if hes going to run an outside washington campaign
3021902 i do believe this changes the situation quite a bit but not for mccain
3021903 i think john mccain probably knows who its going to be it may be between two people but i think barack obama has a more difficult selection particularly with the russia georgia conflict going on
3021904 it probably will rule out who some of the folks that hes considered who really dont have any foreign policy experience

3021908 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3021909 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3021910 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3021911 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3021912 this study provides confirmation that marriage does tend to make people healthier they didnt look at the quality of an individual marriage but that being married is more likely overall to make you happier than not being married

3022100 in illinois the state version of baipa repeatedly failed thanks in large part to then state sen barack obama it only passed in 2005 after obama left
3022101 obama articulately worried that legislation protecting live aborted babies might infringe on womens rights or abortionists rights obamas clinical discourse his lack of mercy shocked me i was naive back then obama voted against the measure twice it ultimately failed
3022102 so the reason keyes said jesus christ wouldnt vote for barack obama was because of obamas fanatical support of abortion to the point of condoning infanticide
3022103 that we live in a pluralistic society and that i cant impose my religious views on another
3022104 obama insinuated opposition to abortion is based only on religion lecturing pro lifers like me to explain why abortion violates some principle that is accessible to people of all faiths including those with no faith at all
3022105 i dont recall mentioning religion when i testified against live birth abortion i only recall describing a live aborted baby i held in a hospital soiled utility room until he died and a live aborted baby who was accidentally thrown into the trash
3022106 i recall comparisons made to u s laws ensuring animals being killed are treated humanely i recall testimony that late term babies feel excruciating pain while being aborted

3022157 georgia continues to use force and in this regard we cannot consider this document
3022158 my grandson screamed uncle putin please help us help us so that the georgians dont kill me they were screaming and crying it was terrible a nightmare
3022159 thank god the russians have come it is getting better
3022160 the attempt to turn white into black black into white and to adeptly portray victims of aggression as aggressors and place the responsibility for the consequences of the aggression on the victims
3022161 rule out a repetition of the situation russian peacekeepers faced in tskhinvali
3022162 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3022163 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3022164 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity

3022169 it was only out on i tunes earlier but now people can go out and buy it ive just come back from maidstone hmv and ive bought a couple of copies
3022170 it is available in different mixes including a dance mix so we are hoping for the track to move up the charts
3022171 i would love to see it sneak into the top 20 that would be excellent
3022172 but as it is we came in higher than scouting for girls so everyone concerned was pleased
3022173 i admit it was a gamble but so far it has paid off
3022174 dance music as a whole is controlled by the larger labels so for a small independent one to have such a good chart result is a notable achievement
3022175 what i would really like to see happen here is that we develop a brand identity which people associate with putting out really good dance tracks
3022176 the labels base is in a part of maidstone which the council has talked about developing as a hub for music and the arts
3022177 it would be great to see things like more studios people involved in the media and other creative work going on around here

3022185 dr nelson enjoys the complete support of the victorian division
3022186 my joining the group was by no means intended to destabilise or cause any untoward impact on the current leader it was a demonstration of my high esteem for peter costello
3022187 its worried about the global outlook and concerned that that financial turmoil could exacerbate the slowdown

3022198 when you discuss security issues if you are telling the truth that should be something protected at the core of the first amendment
3022199 if you are truthfully telling the world about a dangerous situation and it is a situation which is dangerous not because the security researcher exposes the vulnerability but because the person who made the product made the vulnerability then this should be core speech
3022200 knowingly causes the transmission of a program information code or command to a computer or computer system
3022201 the statute on its face appears to be discussing sending code or similar types of information to a computer
3022202 it does not appear to contemplate somebody who is giving a talk to humans nevertheless the court believed that the act of giving a presentation to a group of humans was covered by the computer fraud computer intrusion statute we believe this is wrong
3022203 basically what the court is suggesting here is that giving a presentation involving security to other security researchers is a violation of federal law
3022204 as far as i know this is completely unprecedented and it has a tremendous chilling effect on sharing this sort of research and we intend to fight it with everything weve got

3022261 but i think there are more pressing issues facing our country right now
3022262 the democratic leadership turned out the lights on the debate on energy and went home for vacation
3022263 everyone here at home is struggling there are steps that can be taken but when legislation is blocked from coming to a vote nothing can get done the least we can do for our community is to continue to discuss the issues while we wait for congress to re convene
3022264 its time to stop voting no and to stop playing party politics its time to put all options on the table and zucchinis arent going to lower the price of gas
3022265 if you have a home or small business network wep does a good job of keeping most people out at least those that are honest beware though there are true hackers around who can exploit the weaknesses of wep and access wep enabled networks especially those with high utilization
3022266 their recommendation is pretty obvious wep should not be used

3022281 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3022282 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3022283 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3022284 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3022285 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3022286 hell be a big asset to the club hes been around at the highest level
3022287 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3022288 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3022289 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3022296 johann haris blog the title is mostly correct but one half is easier than the other to achieve and no energy independence is not the easy part although it should be but politics and stupidity will prevent it from happening any time soon
3022297 we are tired of them pushing their women empowerment training on us without providing opportunities to create sustainable jobs and solid careers the abstract concepts are fine but they are not helping us create businesses or helping our children learn computer skills they force us to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on restaurants hotels and seminars and refuse to give us part of the money to build a small center to train women and children on how to use the computer

3022300 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
3022301 because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
3022302 our legal team are going to be exhausting every possible channel for holding the police accountable for the draconian use of stop and search measures for the things they confiscated and for their violent incursions on to the camp
3022303 every year police use the supposed existence of a hardcore minority as justification for their heavy handedness and every year this hardcore minority fails to materialise
3022304 answer the demands of the dress to impress myself generation
3022305 it is clear that despite the impressive political energy and resources focused on education iod members believe the government has generally performed poorly in this critical arena there is a substantial credibility gap between what official statistics show and what employers feel on the front line
3022306 even at face value the official figures illustrate a need for a step change in performance to meet future skill needs
3022307 there is absolutely no doubt that english and maths standards have risen over the last decade results have risen and quality has been rigorously scrutinised by our independent exam regulators
3022308 business concerns about school leavers reflect the reality of the changing economy with historic low unemployment and the virtual elimination of low skill jobs the reality is that employers rightly have far higher expectations of workers skills than ever before
3022309 i will report this autumn to the regulator ofqual and to the department for children schools and families dcsf on matters within their respective remits
3022310 the current national testing system is not set in stone as we said in the childrens plan there may well be changes
3022311 could be more flexible for schools more personalised for individual pupils and provide more scope for teacher assessment and professional judgment
3022312 this is why we are currently carrying out a pilot in 450 schools of stage not age tests which allow children to take shorter tests when they are ready rather than waiting until a fixed point at 11 or 14
3022313 im attracted to the testing when ready principle but ill only implement it following rigorous evaluation of whether it helps children make faster progress
3022314 knife crime is a complex issue which we all need to work together to solve
3022315 enforcement action is one part of the solution and that is why i am today calling on our partners in the police and trading standards to get tough with anyone illegally selling knives to under 18s
3022316 i want to see more test purchasing operations like those being undertaken in birmingham to catch any unscrupulous retailers
3022317 a one off crackdown is all very well but labour are still failing to enforce the knife laws we already have
3022318 they talk tough about increasing penalties but in the last five years for which figures are available not a single person has been sent to prison for selling knives to children
3022319 ministers must ensure that those caught in future are given more than just the pathetic fines seen in recent years

3022323 but i said you know what this is ridiculous this is the olympics and im here for the united states of america i dont care how bad it hurts honestly in like five seconds i was thinking all these things i just got like a super charge and just took it from there it was unreal
3022324 i gave it everything i had possibly but they got me on the end i feel like i should have got my hand on the wall first
3022325 this morning bob bowman had said the french was saying some stuff talking a little bit of trash
3022326 it fired me up more than anything else i told garret and he said you know what were going to let our swimming do the talking
3022327 his last 50 meters were absolutely incredible and he had a perfect finish
3022328 it was looking like sergios day and i just wanted to hang around and get some opportunities
3022329 i knew what i had to do i was playing catch up and had to take on the shots on the back nine that would mean the difference between winning or losing
3022330 im a great believer in making it your own responsibility to win or lose in a major
3022331 you know the good thing about it is i feel good out there i felt like i played good i definitely feel like i played well enough to win but unfortunately it didnt happen so thats pretty much all i can ask myself to do
3022332 those guys were having such a good battle every hole it seemed like those guys were making something it was fun to hear and a lot of fun to play out there in a championship like this
3022333 coming down the last two holes i had a chance to win the golf tournament and thats all you can ask you dont get these opportunities very often and to be able to stick in there and to be able to hold my emotions under control is a good feeling
3022334 i read it exactly how i wanted it and it did exactly what i expected
3022335 i obviously hold a lot of european players who i grew up watching in high esteem
3022336 to believe that i achieved something they hadnt is very special
3022337 i have no regrets of anything i did out there
3022338 expected to wear licensed garb of the local nfl team

3022341 we understand penalties and turnovers but we got to cover everything is there we just got to go and do it

3022351 it will assist our efforts to grow the uav capability in platforms such as shadow predator reaper raven and hunter
3022352 it will allow us to buy additional scan eagle detachments
3022353 all these procurements are focused on manned and unmanned isr capabilities and the infrastructure that is necessary to process and disseminate the information you get from these
3022354 the effect of the task force is to help ensure we are using isr resources effectively in support of our combat commanders and forces
3022355 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers and the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region that is very industrially active
3022356 capmex is going to be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
3022357 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3022358 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
3022359 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
3022360 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in how solar energy is distributed throughout the polluted regions of our atmosphere
3022361 capmex takes his work an important step forward with new innovative micro and nano sensor technologies that will provide additional quantitative estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
3022362 specifically we have endeavored to improve the disability evaluation system established the federal recovery coordination program improved data sharing between the departments of defense and veterans affairs developed housing facility inspection standards and improved delivery of pay and benefits
3022363 we have laid the groundwork and now we are getting ready to choose other regions and to move forward from there
3022364 va people are in military treatment facilities to an extent they have never been in the past so we can pick up these people and know who they are and what their needs are and what their families needs are before they wind up in the va
3022365 that way we can work on the transfer to anticipate the needs and make the necessary arrangements for them
3022366 were in the first phase of this effort but were taking the lessons learned from it and going into the second phase
3022367 we need to do it accurately kindly and get them what they need
3022368 so the closer we work with dod the easier it is going to be once they cross the line from dod into va for us to be prepared to serve them
3022369 the hmong people in the united states and hmong national development inc are calling upon the lao lpdr regime to immediately and unconditionally release the lao student pro democracy demonstrators of october 1999 and hmong refugees recently forced back to laos who continue to be jailed in laos in terrible conditions
3022370 many of the hmong refugees forced back to laos from thailand have disappeared in the lao gulag and reeducation camp system where they are endanger of torture and execution or have simply disappeared at the hands of lpdr security and military troops
3022371 the government in laos should be accountable to the international community to release the lao student pro democracy demonstrators and provide information about the over 1300 of hmong political refugees recently forced by the thai third army military troops from ban huay nam khao refugee camp in thailand back to laos
3022372 just like the lao students arrested in vientiane the lao lpdr government has imprisoned hundreds of the hmong refugees in reeducation camps and jails many been threatened tortured executed or have disappeared in recent weeks
3022373 it is very sad that the hundreds of hmong families brutally forced back to laos a gun point recently by prime minister samak and the soldiers of the thai third army have been broken up and sent to different places by the lpdr military and many of the hmong men have been summarily executed or imprisoned without charges others have been sent to reeducation camps and treated as political prisoners for no justifiable reason we have reports that many of the women have be raped have disappeared or have been killed others have been separated from their children
3022374 last night in a cell phone text message that was quickly followed by an e mail linking back to a new page on his web site my barackobama com vp aides to sen barack obamas d ill campaign wrote barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt message between now amp the conv tell everyone to text vp to 62262 to be the first to know please forward note three things the casual reference to the candidate barack the call to forward the text to friends relatives etc the perceived personal appeal of being the first to know and the timing the text was sent two weeks before the democratic national convention kicks off that gives plenty of time for the text to be passed around it also gives the obama campaign one more way to differentiate itself technologically from its republican opponent sen john mccain r ariz doesnt have a text messaging program

3022471 previous work on the area was qualitative indicating several areas of mineralisation the quality of previous drilling was highly variable therefore the drill programme requires twinning of up to 20 percent of rc holes and several of the diamond drill holes
3022472 seven vertical percussion holes ha 01 p to ha 07 p were drilled on the north limb of zone 2 along a 400 meter strike length six of the holes intersected mineralisation and represent a new discovery in zone 2 the new discovery is over 1000 metres from known mineralisation
3022473 these results are very exciting and represent a new discovery along the mineralised horizon in an area where there was no previous work we are more than a kilometre away from any previous drilling and open along strike our drilling to date confirms copper silver mineralisation in seven distinct areas each open along strike and depth it is worth noting that we have tested just a fraction of the more than 500 km long favourable horizon
3022474 we are in the same type of rocks on which the zambian province is based this licence area as the zambian copperbelt the latter has higher mineralisation
3022475 the system is very consistent we have drilled 106 holes and 102 of them have similar mineralisation thats a success rate unheard of the scale and the continuity makes it exciting

3022613 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3022614 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3022615 did the brent students know that over half the students at oxford and cambridge come from private schools they had no idea and it shocked them
3022616 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3022617 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3022618 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3022619 our supporter palitha priyantha was recently assaulted with swords by minister jayasekaras driver sumith
3022620 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3022621 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3022672 the upa governments economic policies are dictated by the world bank imf and the us all talk of liberalisation and globalisation is for their benefit and we in the left will take the fight against it to the streets with the nation wide general strike on august 20
3022673 the manmohan singh government might have won a pyrrhic victory but its efforts to isolate the left has come to a nought with several constituents of the unpa including tdp and agp besides the bsp and rld veering towards us as part of the exercise to cobble together an alternative to the upa and nda

3022712 in a sustainable energy future electricity will become the prime energy carrier we now have to focus our research on electricity storage electric cars and the modernization of the existing electricity infrastructure

3022730 all of us i am sure 10 years ago thought that the need for the man with the rifle would be passing away from the scene in the 1960s
3022731 but the very size and magnitude of these new great weapons have placed a new emphasis upon what we call rather strangely conventional war and they have made it even more mandatory that we keep the man with the rifle
3022732 is not a right granted by the constitution neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence the second amendment declares that it shall not be infringed
3022733 and we may be thankful that frightened civil authorities and specific ladies clubs have not managed to eradicate from the country the tradition of the possession and use of firearms that profound and almost instinctive tradition of americans for one does not really learn to shoot a rifle or machine gun in a few weeks luckily for us our tradition of bearing arms has not gone from the country the tradition is so deep and so dear to us that it is one of the most treasured parts of the bill of rights the right of all americans to bear arms with the implication that they will know how to use them

3022741 the jobs market has been one of the few bright spots in the uk economy but cracks are appearing in the face of an increasingly uncertain economic outlook
3022742 even if we avoid the scale of jobs fallout suffered in previous downturns the era of the candidates recruitment market is already over with people in work becoming increasingly anxious that their p45 might soon be on its way
3022743 with pay pressure still subdued mounting job insecurity is being compounded by a significant squeeze on workers real incomes but the absence of any sign of an emerging wage price spiral at least offers greater hope that the bank of england might soon be able to cut interest rates to head off the threat of recession
3022744 companies are now reacting to deteriorating market conditions with sales slowing and input costs rising but scope to raise prices limited by weakening demand finances are under pressure
3022745 it looks as if employment costs the main area over which businesses retain control are taking the strain with employers seeking both to keep a lid on pay settlements and in increasing numbers planning for redundancies the labour market is suddenly looking a lot less resilient

3022814 it is clear that despite the impressive political energy and resources focused on education iod members believe the government has generally performed poorly in this critical arena there is a substantial credibility gap between what official statistics show and what employers feel on the front line

3022825 questioning is not bad as long as parents are willing to listen and there is true dialogue

3022832 ever since we launched newwest net back in 2005 our community has been asking us for a print magazine

3022834 the mountain west is changing dramatically with farms giving way to subdivisions ranches turning into hunting and fishing retreats and cities and towns becoming far more vibrant and cosmopolitan were all grappling with the changes

3022892 psychology research has validated that our beliefs are ingrained by the time we are six years of age
3022893 further more recent evidence suggests that beliefs are formed as early as three years of age

3023016 dieser typ verwertet nahrung extrem schlecht braucht mehr kalorien als mancher dicke
3023017 vorsicht bei rohkost vollkornprodukten zu viel obst das st rt bei diesem typ oft die verdauung verh rtetet den bauch und f hrt zu schw che und fr steln besser produkte aus wei em mehl und nur sparsam obst und gem se
3023018 hier gelten etwas abgeschw cht die gleichen regeln wie f r den stark leptosomen typ drei bis f nf mittelgro e mahlzeiten am tag sind ideal
3023019 trotzdem gilt kochen sie das gem se ruhig durch der vitaminverlust spielt hier keine rolle
3023020 dieser typ ver ndert sich je nach lebenslage und muss dann entsprechend seine ern hrung und den sport anpassen
3023021 diesen typ hat man noch vor wenigen jahren als gesund oder stattlich bezeichnet heute f hlen sich besonders die frauen unter ihnen zu dick fast immer brigens zu unrecht
3023022 drei genussvolle mahlzeiten ganz in ruhe w ren ideal das stabilisiert diesen figurtyp st ndige di ten f hren langfristig zu gewichtszunahme weil der k rper dann gegensteuert und neue fettvorr te anlegt
3023023 am tisch wird dieser typ oft komisch angesehen weil er so viel isst dabei nimmt er insgesamt oft weniger kalorien zu sich als mancher schlanke
3023024 er sollte auf t glich drei mahlzeiten achten das stabilisiert seine figur und sch tzt die verdauung
3023025 dieser typ vertr gt rohkost und vollkorn sollte sich dazu aber nicht zwingen
3023026 an bergewicht ist h ufig nicht zu viel essen schuld
3023027 sondern zu viel stress im job im privatleben in der freizeit aber auch durch st ndige oft unbegr ndete sorgen um die figur
3023028 wer stress in allen formen aus seinem leben nimmt kann bis zu zehn kilo dauerhaft abnehmen und er muss dazu seine ern hrung kaum umstellen
3023029 bei stress bildet sich im k rper verst rkt das hormon cortisol es ist schuld wenn sich fett anreichert besonders am bauch
3023030 das hat jeder schon im urlaub beobachtet man hat abgenommen obwohl man mehr als sonst gegessen hat weil man weniger stress hatte
3023031 unsere statur ist in den genen festgelegt studien zeigten dass sie sich auch durch di ten oder sport nicht dauerhaft ver ndern l sst wer es trotzdem immer wieder versucht setzt sich stress aus und wird am ende sogar noch dicker

3023042 bindra is a shy and introvert person who is solely focussed on achieving fame for the country we really dont know how many companies or products he would be willing to endorse and how much he would secure in way of endorsements
3023043 there is no precedent for such a kind of achievement in india we also have not done any strategising and really cannot say how much possibility there is as far as securing endorsement for him is concerned

3023170 there should be plenty of meteors perhaps one to two every minute
3023171 we believe these first quarter results together with the recently announced initial enrollment experience for the indiana medicaid care select programs follow an overall trend of improved performance for arcadia
3023172 the initial results from the care select programs suggest that members are benefiting from improved medication management and that indiana tax payers are benefiting from more cost effective pharmaceutical care in addition we have streamlined our focus on dailymed sales as we move past the initial roll out with care select members starting in august and as we continue conversations with additional payor sources
3023173 while we experienced a slight decrease in overall revenue we are encouraged by increased sales of home care services and home health products in our services and hhe segments
3023174 these increases were offset by reductions in the companys medical staffing and industrial staffing revenues which have been impacted by industry trends and general economic conditions in the per diem market and more recently the travel nursing segment versus last year
3023175 however we believe there are opportunities for organic growth in the markets we serve as well as room for expansion into new markets through accretive acquisitions and by the start up of new locations we are working daily to find opportunities to solidify arcadias position as one of the premiere home care and staffing providers in the country
3023176 the modest ebitda loss for the quarter reflects a ramp up in our investment to grow our pharmacy segment in anticipation of increased revenues
3023177 we are particularly pleased with the 280 basis point improvement in our gross margins this noteworthy improvement was driven primarily from the increase in the mix of business towards the higher margin home care market as well as significant reductions in our workers compensation expenses

3023185 frozen sperm banks have been available for over thirty years egg freezing and thawing has been much more technically challenging nevertheless research has progressed and various options for egg freezing and banking have now arrived
3023186 frozen eggs offer women options in deciding when they wish to conceive whether with their own eggs or with donor eggs
3023187 some women have diseases such as cancer earlier in life and must delay childbearing in addition cancer treatments can destroy eggs around the world many women have chosen to bank their eggs and or ovarian tissue for future use others have opted to use donor eggs
3023188 many of our patients who use donor eggs are only in their thirties
3023189 they are often upset because no one informed them previously that ovarian aging is a serious and common problem
3023190 freezing eggs give women and couples the time and convenience of using their eggs when they are ready to get pregnant liberated from the financial personal and ethical dilemma presented with frozen embryos
3023191 egg donation is a highly successful treatment option for women who may not be able to get pregnant with their own eggs but are still able to carry a pregnancy however the process of selecting the right womens eggs often presents challenges
3023192 patients frustrated by years of tests and failures greatly value the speed and convenience of frozen eggs and will seek the procedure in greater percentages
3023193 the attacks by eastern turkestan terrorists have never stopped in the xinjiang region
3023194 the very purpose of their attacks is all about separating the region from china and such a behavior would not be tolerated by any country in the world
3023195 of course i imagine they want to leverage the platform of the olympic games to magnify their impact
3023196 i believe their very purpose of doing all this is about separation

3023210 it wasnt an easy race but i felt like at the 1 000 meter mark it had the potential to be under control
3023211 but its the olympics and nobody mellows out at the 1 000 even if they are up on the pack it was definitely a push all the way to the finish as everybody wants that top seed

3023243 preventing the secondary effects of adult entertainment establishments is zoning the solution

3023245 i recognize the courts have upheld the constitutional rights of people to buy and sell these materials the courts have also said governments have the right to regulate where such materials are sold
3023246 all are deeply destructive images that erode male respect for women
3023247 spousal use of pornography and its clinical significance for asian american women
3023248 while erotica has also been defined as literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire it is distinguished from pornography in that it is void of violence illegal portrayals e g children sexism racism and homophobia and is respectful of the human beings involved
3023249 pornography is the material sold in pornography shops for the purpose of producing sexual arousal for mostly male customers second from a critical feminist analysis pornography is a specific kind of sexual material that mediates and helps maintain the sexual subordination of women
3023250 the pursuit of everlasting novelty is the enemy of actual relationship
3023251 in californias unregulated porn film industry an alarming number of performers are infected with hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases and nobody seems to care

3023258 except when the term enters debates among marxists natural is invariably used to preclude any investigation of whether or not people in other societies or in other times may have behaved differently
3023259 in this particular case the argument that pornography is natural ignores the fact that there are men who have given up their obsession with pornography and who have not died
3023260 correlation is not causation but it sure is a hint
3023261 the relationship between particularly sexually violent images in the media and subsequent aggression is much stronger statistically than the relationship between smoking and lung cancer

3023264 the love family ideology has no theory of permanence or binding obligation it is oriented to adults interests and satisfactions because it emphasizes freedom of individual choice you can pick the one you love and ditch the one you no longer love without a backward glance thats great for adults but children dont have the same freedom of choice or the same enthusiasm about moving on from a childs standpoint the love family ideology is inadequate because it offers no basis for permanence in family bonds and commitments when these bonds are lost children suffer emotionally especially in their ability to trust weve set up a failure to commit factor for the next generation
3023265 according to a growing body of social scientific evidence children in families disrupted by divorce and out of wedlock birth do worse than children in intact families on several measures of well being
3023266 contrary to popular belief many children do not bounce back after divorce or remarriage difficulties that are associated with family breakup often persist into adulthood children who grow up in single parent or stepparent families are less successful as adults particularly in the two domains of life love and work that are most essential to happiness needless to say not all children experience such negative effects however research shows that many children from disrupted families have a harder time achieving intimacy in a relationship forming a stable marriage or even holding a steady job

3023272 there is a constant demand for new talent and few actresses last more than a year or two
3023273 people do not as a rule buy pornography in their own neighborhoods
3023274 if we allow local bars to stay open one hour later soon well let them stay open all night

3023280 an effective and rapid consciousness raiser about misogyny and male views of women
3023281 to suggest that this is somehow an issue that only involves consensual adults thats just not true no matter how these girls and women are packaged for sale the reality is that for many of them their life experience is often wrought with abuse and exploitation
3023282 it forces the john to deal with the reality of prostitution instead of their fantasy of whats happening
3023283 it didnt seem realistic that one eight hour day of talking at men would change their behavior
3023284 you can see in their faces that they were really impacted by the story of being abused as a three year old child
3023285 other important steps are changing attitudes through education norma hotalings school for johns is proving to help with part of that equation the school allows first time offenders to remove the arrest from their record if they spend a day in school these men pay approximately 500 00 to learn about the seriousness of second offenses and sexually transmitted diseases most importantly during the seminar former prostitutes tell them the truth about what it is like to be a prostitute out of 900 participants only three have since been arrested on similar charges this school which began in san francisco is being replicated in toronto portland oregon and scores of other cities are considering joining them

3023288 more than 80 of those interviewed told farley they wanted to leave prostitution
3023289 in sweden prostitution is regarded as an aspect of male violence against women and children it is officially acknowledged as a form of exploitation of women and children and constitutes a significant social problem gender equality will remain unattainable so long as men buy sell and exploit women and children by prostituting them

3023334 they told me at the pharmacy that they had to give me the generic
3023335 theyll tell you its the same drug but i felt like something wasnt right and when i checked my blood pressure it was way off
3023336 the fda has no cases where generic drugs have been shown to not perform as expected

3023355 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
3023356 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
3023357 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
3023358 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
3023359 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
3023360 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
3023361 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community

3023379 several events in china have raised concerns about public safety during the games chinese officials anxious to ensure the olympics would be safe in the city of 17 million have thrown down a smothering blanket of security
3023380 on aug 4 2008 a vehicle rammed into a chinese police station in western china and attackers threw grenades killing 32 people the deadliest attack on security forces in recent times chinese counterterrorism experts claim that the country tracks a number of terrorist groups from muslim separatists al qaeda and falun gong to ethnic chinese
3023381 from a safety and security perspective the beijing olympics are the third major olympic event to occur outside the united states since 9 11 at the previous two events in athens and turin a security and crisis response operations center was centrally located at the games clear event planning and crisis response roles and responsibilities for participating agencies were spelled out beforehand and planning for olympic related security expenditures was accomplished early says security consultant richard p grassie cpp president techmark security integration inc rockland ma
3023382 its a fine line between balancing public safety and security to protect citizens from terrorism and respecting civil liberties in a free society
3023383 chinas installation of thousands of surveillance cameras on lampposts and in beijing internet caf s and bars may have another intent to track dissidents who oppose the current one party rule the most extensive and sophisticated western video monitoring will remain in place after the olympics are over other video monitoring systems are being installed in chinas 600 largest cities

3023388 we do think there are many witnesses because at that time around 7 p m there were a lot of people in the park or in the surroundings of the park
3023389 there were also people who were part of the altercation and many people playing sports or just sitting in the park
3023390 its too early to say what happened exactly were talking about the death of a man its a major investigation
3023391 we only know what we see in the news in the newspapers thats all
3023392 there should be plenty of meteors perhaps one or two every minute
3023393 after saying these things jesus went away and was hidden from them
3023394 it wasnt a difficult choice to make coming here everyone in the papers was saying i was going to sunderland or aston villa but i only ever wanted to come here
3023395 as soon as i knew they were interested i said i want to come to pompey
3023396 welcomed by some democrats as a way to broaden the partys support
3023397 republicans do nothing to help pregnant women who are facing pregnancy
3023398 if you make abortion illegal what are these women going to do
3023399 these kinds of efforts are perennial theyre based on the assumption that democrats position isnt in the mainstream and thats just wrong theyve not succeeded in curtailing democrats principles and i dont think they will in the future
3023400 proxy war in larger internecine face off what role should pro life activists play in a pro choice party
3023401 its been our view as democrats that women should make their decisions based on their moral values

3023403 i truly believe my party will be the one to solve this issue
3023404 hbc activities need to be adequately equipped so that timely and high quality care is delivered to those in need that is why it is important for the government the private sector and funding agencies to partner with civil society and to provide significant funding to these projects
3023405 as a result the role of this vital national resource is now largely limited to providing psychological support
3023406 reducing the impact of hiv and aids on communities in developing countries is a priority for irish aid and documenting lessons learned is an essential component to shaping effective responses
3023407 researchers noticed years ago that hiv infection rarely occurred in them
3023408 one hypothesis is that they mount an immune response that protected them
3023409 it may seem like special treatment veterans say they deserve that
3023410 we believe unapologetically that veterans do deserve to be taken care of first
3023411 all were asking them to do is fund va at the level that is needed not at the level the government wants to spend
3023412 i dont think anyone is suggesting that we stiff our veterans but there is a level of flexibility that you need to have in the discretionary budget
3023413 these findings are consistent with the efficacy and safety data seen with isentress in treatment experienced patients

3023451 we might get a heavy track judging by the forecast and running over 1200 metres on a heavy track is much like running over 1400 anyway
3023452 we always start our stayers off over 1200 because it gives you the option of going to 1400 or 1600 at their next start why take the hard road when you have a softer option

3023458 the high grade footwall style mineralization intersected on the morgan lumsden property has similar characteristics to known footwall hosted zones within the sudbury basin and represents an attractive exploration target for fni
3023459 the significance of this drill intercept is uncertain at this time and further drilling will be required to define the size and orientation of the mineralized system drilling is scheduled to continue throughout the remainder of 2008 testing the up dip potential to the northwest as well as exploring the basal contact of the sudbury igneous complex to the east
3023460 our analysis of the potential market for thyrotest indicates that it is much larger than the current estimated instance of hypothyroidism in the u s
3023461 the wide range of symptoms most of them very common in todays society opens what we view to be a significant opportunity for a screening device like thyrotest that is clia waived and therefore allowed to be used in a wide variety of testing venues we also believe that thyrotest is significantly superior to competitive products and our marketing strategy for the product will include providing data that supports this contention
3023462 the era of smaller more fuel efficient vehicles is upon us
3023463 until recently motorcycles and scooters were considered the choice of enthusiasts or people who were just interested in fun and recreation but with gas prices dramatically rising we believe a growing number of consumers will be interested in buying or leasing motorcycles and scooters for extremely practical reasons with most motorcycles averaging from 40 to 60 miles per gallon and many scooters averaging up to 70 or more miles per gallon a lot of people are now interested in acquiring these vehicles for commuting to and from work and for local and mid distance transportation
3023464 it isnt necessarily that consumers are getting rid of their cars pickup trucks or suvs
3023465 rather its a case of people recognizing that there are real economical alternatives to the high cost of operating larger vehicles to which weve grown accustomed our staff has been hearing a lot of anecdotal commentary from our new customers that strongly reinforces the expectations weve had for over a year that a growing number of people would be moving to motorcycles and scooters because of the increasing price of fuel with the current average price of regular gas hovering just over 4 a gallon and with many analysts predicting continuing record high prices for the foreseeable future we anticipate continuing interest in powersport vehicles as a direct result of this trend

3023467 all wins are important but i suppose since the origin series weve been labouring a little bit at some stages in some games
3023468 we think theres some areas of our game we can improve and well have to improve but there were some good signs to be able to play 80 minutes at that intensity against manly even though we probably didnt execute it as well as wed like
3023469 the origin series takes a lot out of some guys physically and takes a lot out of some guys mentally so even during and after the origin series theres usually some signs there that weve had nine or 10 players who havent been at their best
3023470 a lot of its mental especially this time of the year but were sort of concentrating a little bit more on our physical stuff at the moment because we gave the origin players a whole heap of rest
3023471 we are happy with dean and he is happy with us i believe
3023472 the position i will be taking as ceo is that i would look at recommending an extension and if we are all agreed we would look at that at the end of this season

3023479 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3023480 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3023481 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3023482 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3023483 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3023484 were a u s licensed based and regulated company that co mingles all our bets into the u s host track pools and have a proven track record of processing over 200 000 000 in pari mutuel wagers

3023496 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3023507 had to be made like his brothers in every respect so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of god to make propitiation for the sins of the people for because he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted
3023508 the suffering of the earth and earth creatures the despair of our young people the emptiness of our souls that sets us up for addictions on such an immense scale all this argues for a spiritual awakening for living out of creation spirituality in our daily lives
3023509 meditation is to see into our own nature and wake up if we are not aware of what is going on in ourselves and in the world how can we see into our own nature and wake up are we really awake when we drink our tea read our newspaper or use the toilet

3023511 the young players have taken a lot of responsibility they have helped to take down pressure from the seniors and the seniors players also pushed themselves hard and contributed to the win
3023512 the guys showed tremendous character after the 2nd test debacle we spoke about the areas to improve and each one took responsibilities
3023513 both the spinners mendis and muralitharan bowled in tandem and helped to keep indias total under control
3023514 i think it just goes to show just how bearish the market has turned
3023515 its like it was when prices went up it didnt seem to matter what bearish news came out the price just kept going up

3023519 the batsmen did not put up a good show here and that probably cost us the series it was critical that the middle order got runs and there was not enough consistency from any of the batters and that probably what cost us the game and the test match here
3023520 having won the toss it was important to get a big score we got a good start but could not capitalise for a new batsman to go straightway and face two spinners it is never easy if they had converted the early starts it would have been a different story overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series
3023521 bowlers put their hearts out ishant showed brilliant performance throughout the series zaheer showed lot of character harbhajan was fantastic to come back from all that he had been through during the last couple of months
3023522 i have never seen so many players getting injured in a single day but i guess that is a part and parcel of the game
3023523 i think mendis was the difference picking up 26 wickets when murali and mendis bowl together it is not easy to get runs out of them and we kept losing wickets because of the pressure created by the two they bowled brilliantly throughout the series
3023524 mark winter is a really funny guy and holds the attention of the children very well we saw children respond to the gospel in marks presentation and did not want to leave when it was over i highly recommend marks ministry to you

3023529 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3023530 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
3023531 we really did our homework on this one and we are completely blown away by how the deltek vision product is able to handle the needs of project driven clients
3023532 when we began to explore partnering with deltek we were amazed at the strength of the organization and their commitment of resources to both the vision product and their growing business partner channel we are delighted to be part of the team
3023533 by combining delteks deep domain expertise with equation technologies success and reputation in the industry we continue to successfully build our market reach while adding additional customer services

3023539 i am excited to be joining such a dynamic team and a company whose growth opportunities are limitless i look forward to working with everyone during this next growth phase of theladders com both here in the u s and around the world
3023540 we are encouraged by the results of our initial airings and are pleased to expand our campaign to include the addition of two new channels
3023541 within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995
3023542 we are giving our existing and prospective simplevoicebox and simplevoicecenter customers a truly no limits voicemail service
3023543 we now offer unlimited outgoing greetings place no limits on incoming messages and do not require access codes or extra digits you simply dial the area code and number it is powerful yet simple
3023544 online identity protection is key when socializing interacting or transacting on some of these popular sites we are providing anonymous private and confidential numbers that can be given out without the need to disclose actual contact information private numbers are a great alternative to your home or cell phone numbers
3023545 for the past four years simplevoicebox and simplevoicecenter have been providing extremely useful voicemail services to more than 800 000 users resulting in more than 7 5 million connected calls per month
3023546 we hope to replicate our success as the leading provider of free conferencing solutions and become the leader in voicemail services
3023547 our document management system is a big time saver for kcdc employees and legal professionals who regularly access court records
3023548 before people had to travel to the courthouse where the records were stored or the court had to mail files from one location to another in addition to the time and costs associated with searching for and copying records occasionally the wrong documents were placed in files now access is immediate and easy making the process more efficient and productive for all
3023549 with our new esuperform solution some of our police agencies now report probable cause statements to the booking facility using their laptops or a kiosk in the jail and the prosecutor transmits them electronically to the emc information infrastructure
3023550 weve automated the process to the extent that human hands seldom have to touch paper documents and the documents themselves have never existed in paper the cost savings are huge because countless hours and reams of paper have been cut from the process
3023551 with legal records under our jurisdiction we must pay close attention to court and state laws mandating document retention
3023552 unlike the king county superior court which is required to keep some court records forever we have finite document retention periods by using emc centeras intelligent software were able to automatically delete certain documents when they reach end of life this has made managing document retention and deletion cycles much simpler and more reliable and ensures were compliant with regulations
3023553 breastfeeding promotion programs encourage women to start but dont provide the support to continue
3023554 we are finding that breastfeeding rates arent just explained by the individuals who live in these areas theres something about the areas themselves and breastfeeding
3023555 its a sad irony both in terms of health needs and the expense these families incur buying formula
3023556 this year we had to cope with exceptional heavy ice coverage
3023557 we are happy and content that we were able to recover and exchange the equipment considering the extreme ice conditions
3023558 we have been documenting this water mass for years near greenland
3023559 it was almost impossible to provide evidence of it since 2004
3023560 for these purposes we had to relocate the equipment anchored at the seafloor last year further to the north to follow the receding ice and to ascertain that they stood at least temporarily in the sphere of influence of the ice edge
3023561 for instance weve learned that when someone has a haploid insufficiency and is missing one copy of the tgf gene he or she is more vulnerable to environmental insults that can cause cleft palate such as drugs smoking and alcohol
3023562 we found that if we blocked tgf or the receptors a cleft palate develops
3023563 but when smad4 was blocked normal palate epithelium still covered the palatal shelf
3023564 i think it just goes to show just how bearish the market has turned
3023565 its like it was when prices went up it didnt seem to matter what bearish news came out the price just kept going up
3023566 when i grow up i wanna be a yorkie farmer
3023567 it was that democrats are united around a commitment to provide every american access to affordable comprehensive health care
3023568 should have the option of keeping the coverage they have or choosing from a wide array of health insurance plans including many private health insurance options and a public plan
3023569 it was originally crafted after salmon fishing in tofino with my in laws
3023570 i had never been fishing on the open ocean before nor had fred kraus my father in law nonetheless a nice side of salmon was decorated for the grill with whatever we had in the cabin
3023571 serve with a wonderful fruity white wine and a salad and you have a nice west coast meal
3023572 i cant think of a single specialist batsman or bowler who played a large number of odi games and did extremely well who could not make it in test cricket
3023573 there was a time when sumner was very close to a lot of people the only thing thats certain is that if sumner is close to you now he wont be close to you in the future because thats been his track record including with family members
3023574 when redstone would talk to me about freston who i think is a great executive he used to talk like he was his son
3023575 then the stock goes down for two days and he fired him
3023576 i am very focused on getting everything done i can get done between now and january 19
3023577 none of these problems has been easy but we have stood with one another through them all although john believes he should stand alone and take the consequences of his action now when the door closes behind him he has his family waiting for him

3023579 and reuters and mainly mcclatchy and youve got over 25 deaths that includes 3 corpses discovered in baghdad on the plus side at least the paper is finally reporting deaths of us service members anyone getting their news only from the print edition of the new york times would have no idea that u s soldier 17 iraqis killed in suicide blast
3023580 sundays attacks showed the challenges still facing american forces in iraq who number about 140 000 and the iraqi security forces who ultimately will have the task of protecting the country
3023581 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
3023582 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
3023583 the small group structure is the structure of renewal in every facet of christianity including catholicism
3023584 the first reformation begun by martin luther was about the creeds doctrine our doctrines were established by the first reformation
3023585 an act of gods free grace wherein he pardoned all our sins and accepteth us as righteous in his sight only for the righteousness of christ imputed to us and received by faith alone
3023586 one of the greater challenges in engaging in discussions with roman catholics involves the issue of salvation
3023587 certainly catholics deny that their church teaches a works salvation
3023588 o pior erro ser sempre o de partir de um preconceito mesmo que este se diga fundeado em an lises cient ficas e aqui chegamos a uma
3023589 os factos cient ficos n o s o um retrato da realidade
3023590 was able to rest in a manner suitable to a minister of god
3023591 they did not need to resort to being vulgar and violent to alcohol and drugs
3023592 does not find rest in this way the heart does not feel joy nor find peace but ends up feeling more tired and sad than before
3023593 i referred to young people because they are often the most eager for life and new experiences and therefore also the most at risk
3023594 the human person is truly renewed only in a relationship with god
3023595 legal and constitutional protection for the definition of marriage as the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others
3023596 reflects the natural biological complementarity between man and woman which predates the state and which is woven into the social and religious fabric of every major culture and society
3023597 any governmental action or policy that promotes abortion embryonic stem cell research human cloning euthanasia assisted suicide and other offenses against life
3023598 our fellow catholics who are elected officials to be true to the faith they claim to profess by acting bravely and publicly in defense of life
3023599 who do not support the legal protection of unborn children
3023600 i was born a catholic and with forgiveness i hope to die one
3023601 i would prefer to say that rudolph is a religiously inspired terrorist because most mainstream christians consider christian identity to be a heresy
3023602 the penaltys for race mixing homo sexuality and usury are death
3023603 he who hath given forth upon usury and hath taken increase shall he then live he shall not live he hath done all these abominations he shall surely die his blood shall be upon him
3023604 what god created was good therefore jews could not be gods creation
3023605 most of the owners of the largest banks in america are of eastern european jewish ancestry and connected with the jewish rothschild european banks
3023606 blessed is the lord god of israel for he hath redeemed his people and hath raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant david
3023607 repeatedly bragged that he had been the most wanted man in america and that he was a terrorist it was unbelievable
3023608 if waagner had been a self identified muslim terrorist instead of a christian terrorist hed have been lynched by now but if its fair to say if we can see the religious motivations in the 12
3023609 as the kamikaze is to the japanese as the shiite is to islam as the zionist is to the jew so the phineas priest is to christiandom
3023610 a noose is a symbol of americas oldest form of domestic terrorism
3023611 the noose is replacing the burning cross in the mind of much of the public as the leading symbol of the klan
3023612 they are a poisonous kind of hatred and can increase racial tension that may already exist in the area
3023613 like residents of belfast and london americans were beginning to learn to live with acts of religious terrorism shocking disturbing incidents of violence laced with the passion of religion in these cases christianity
3023614 the violence in northern ireland is justified by still other theological positions catholic and protestant
3023615 the ferocity of religious violence was brought home to me in 1998 when i received the news that a car bomb had exploded in a belfast neighborhood i had visited the day before
3023616 pastor alan campbell has also identified the papacy as the antichrist and has described the ira as
3023617 the northern ireland conflict is a religious conflict economic and social considerations are also crucial but it was the fact that the competing populations in ireland adhered and still adhere to competing religious traditions which has given the conflict its enduring and intractable quality
3023618 of course the northern ireland conflict is at heart religious
3023619 politics in the north is not politics exploiting religion that is far too simple an explanation it is one which trips readily off the tongue of commentators who are used to a cultural style in which the politically pragmatic is the normal way of conducting affairs and all other considerations are put to its use in the case of northern ireland the relationship is much more complex it is more a question of religion inspiring politics than of politics making use of religion it is a situation more akin to the first half of seventeenth century england than to the last quarter of twentieth century britain
3023620 ideas of sacrifice and atonement of the blood of martyrs that makes fruitful the seed of faith are to be found all through his writings nay they have here even more than their religious significance and become vitalizing factors in the struggle for irish nationality
3023621 drug dealing counterfeiting and forgery money laundering benefits fraud car theft arms trading extortion and cross border smuggling
3023622 in russia on the other hand even extreme nationalism was always coloured by orthodoxy and consequently was to be considered traditionalist
3023623 judaism does not have any positive conception in the christian sense

3023767 there are so many moments in this movie that i think hard core fans are just going to love
3023768 if it is done the way i think it will be done i think hearts will be in stomachs it is this idea of seeing these characters in a different light i have seen some of the movie i have seen very rough sequences that jj abrams showed me the one where you first sort of see enterprise and you first sort of see the convergence of the crew of the enterprise is a pretty profound moment for me
3023769 the thing that was difficult for me was my very first day on the movie we have this complicated and very interesting scene together and i didnt feel totally on my ground yet particularly with this kind of scene i had never played with another spock before it was weird

3023773 were always very circumspect until we can go aha there it is with everything we build now we want to have this long term relationship with the customer and always have something for them to try so were definitely looking at that for mass effect

3023791 most importantly business users can obtain enterprise level support from sun but not just sun for either staroffice or openoffice
3023792 the business of supporting openoffice org and for that matter staroffice is in fact growing astonishingly fast around the world the mac element is pivotal too even in areas where you see few macs such as in india though that may be changing too
3023793 but the mac presence grants cios and others tasked with choosing the right software for their organizations the assurance and confidence that they can adopt the opendocument format our native format and the only published iso standard file format for office documents and have an office array that includes macs linux solaris windows and so on
3023794 in short openoffice org and the mac version in particular suture the wounds inflicted by 20 years of divergence the connecting thread is the file format and the understanding that what counts is creating communicating preserving files in a format that resists the fragility of monopoly and the reliance on any one company in fact there is a plugin that gives users the ability to read write odf and with open office 3 0 and staroffice 9 0 well have native support of ooxml which ms office 2007 uses
3023795 staroffice is pitched more to those who want the indemnification against suit by microsoft governments oems and to those who want the ease of having at one go the application plus the most useful extensions
3023796 its also more for those who wish to buy again at the outset the support services training that sun sells
3023797 but support services training are also available for openoffice org and many prefer it over staroffice because it may be in a language that staroffice is so far missing or because an officiating body has insisted that the license of the application be open staroffice is built with open source software same code as openoffice org but the license of the actual application is closed to make modifications one can easily download the corresponding openoffice org code and work with the community
3023798 mit diesem vorhaben verliert die mehrwertsteuerpr ferenz der deutsche post ag endg ltig ihre berechtigung es ist nicht einzusehen warum ein paket in einem paketshop bei aldi mehrwertsteuerfrei aufgegeben werden kann aber ein paket das im benachbarten paketshop eines anderen postdienstleisters aufgegeben wird mit 19 prozent mehrwertsteuer belastet wird die deutsche post ag muss sich endlich dem wettbewerb stellen die von der bundesregierung geplante nderung des mehrwertsteuergesetzes muss nunmehr z gig auf den weg gebracht werden

3023824 i can think of no justifiable reason why the former nccu leadership would have completely ignored and failed to abide by the appropriate approval process in creating this program
3023825 such action is contrary to all university policy to say the least it is very disappointing we are working closely with chancellor charlie nelms and his new leadership team to examine the various academic legal and financial questions associated with this georgia based program
3023826 since no members of the current executive leadership team were involved in creating the new birth program we can only infer that it was established in order to provide quality educational opportunities for participating students

3024090 in my opinion it is appropriate to ask for some general benefit information health insurance 401k etc as well as questions regarding the salary range during the interview
3024091 definitely the next step should be a thank you note to everyone involved in the interview process
3024092 i dont think a thank you note or lack thereof will make or break the offer for the right candidate but if there are multiple candidates who are equally qualified and perform well during the interview it sometimes makes a difference
3024093 a candidate should expect some sort of feedback within one week
3024094 once a candidate sends his her thank you note they should avoid emailing or calling to find out the status unless more than a week has passed without any word
3024095 most candidates should take some time to think it over taking into account not only the salary but reviewing the benefits package before making a decision a response is normally expected within one week
3024096 1 be polite and friendly to everyone 2 ask questions 3 dont be afraid to ask for help
3024097 dont expect the first day to be perfect dont expect to remember everything or everyones names remember that if you are nice and courteous to others they usually reciprocate
3024098 characteristics that are observed evaluated in a new employee are things like how they interact with others how they conduct themselves on the telephone how willing they are to learn and ask questions and how quickly they learn what is being taught

3024101 great britain sort of controlled the middle 1 000 meters and obviously we have to go back and try to find a way to contain them there
3024102 it wasnt an easy race but i felt like at the 1 000 meter mark it had the potential to be under control
3024103 but its the olympics and nobody mellows out at the 1 000 even if they are up on the pack it was definitely a push all the way to the finish as everybody wants that top seed
3024104 to give the intern the experience in his core area and at the same time blend the interns work skill sets into a valuable asset to the current team improving productivity and workload functions
3024105 a motivated intern will learn to be a productive member of a team and learn to add value to the assigned group i believe an intern can learn the basic business concepts and most importantly how to communicate and interact with others
3024106 typically the field does pay either a stipend or minimum wage usually free internships are in lower paying fields where the experience is a trade for the pay the intern should ask what specific benefit he or she would receive from the job if it is an unpaid internship perhaps they would be working on a very high profile project that would enhance their resume etc
3024107 he should also make sure he understands the changes he will face in responsibility when he changes from an intern to full time and what his set goals are an intern should make sure he talks about compensation and benefits
3024108 a good supervisor or mentor should always be able to assist the intern in a good guided direction

3024114 i didnt expect to hit hot buttons on the atheist side as much i expected it on the religious side

3024116 thats not to say that one day we might not do a massively multiplayer online version of it but its just not the most interesting initial unveiling of it for me

3024190 flash is seeing a pretty aggressive growth cycle now but i still think javascript is going to be used in 10 times the number of flash apps that launch
3024191 its amazing what people have done with html which was never intended to do rich internet applications and flash was originally created for lightweight animation literally for mickey mouse on the web
3024192 but these technologies were designed for something else and people are really hacking them to do more
3024193 if you put it all together that lends itself to ajax being a very powerful capable rich internet application technology
3024194 if you look at google apps theyre doing great things but how many shops out there have the ajax chops that google does

3024212 things that are dimensional like the dragon lunging at the camera in blu ray really knock your head off because you are seeing all the details we put in it that are even a little better defined
3024213 the dark light values are better so you can be darker and still see all the detail plus you have many more layers of ancillary material and much more information

3024227 to be sure there is often but by no means always anger and bitterness during the breakup of a relationship but displeasure does not necessarily breed dispute why do so many people who were once extraordinarily happy together end up in such deep conflict the answer may be that the custody laws not the people are to blame conflict arises when people believe they are being treated unfairly and treating people unfairly is the hallmark of the family courts where judges actually announce that they are not concerned with fairness to parents

3024270 aw lara its not your fault youre a wonderful person etc
3024271 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
3024272 the company could declare force majeure on its exports from the two ports
3024273 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

3024279 you know ive been finding it hard to get motivated lately and ive been sleeping more than is healthy
3024280 stop being so fucking crazy or at least learn to hide it better
3024281 quit being depressed and miserable and unstable and start being nice fun and happy
3024282 i did everything fairly you all have two shoes one for your right foot and one for your left
3024283 you want the shoes that are best for each of you individually not just any shoe i find
3024284 that doesnt seem fair i wanted to treat you all equally
3024285 it doesnt matter who has more shoe miss david it matters that we all have the right shoes for us
3024286 well if you want to make your way in a mans world you have to act like a man
3024287 we are not screaming our heads off to be placated with promises of equality
3024288 what is radical about it is that we push on demanding to be heard and demanding recognition of our worth
3024289 its a self classification made by a member of the movement not something i just pulled out of my hat
3024290 when we speak of unity what we usually mean is harmony a choir singing in unison sings all the correct notes but doesnt sound nearly as beautiful as one singing in harmony
3024291 hey loser betcha wish you hadnt picked such a hard career path now
3024292 oh gawd not another meme i hate those damn things

3024295 as the ceremony got under way with a dramatic drummed countdown viewers watching at home and on giant screens inside the birds nest national stadium watched as a series of giant footprints outlined in fireworks processed gloriously above the city from tiananmen square
3024296 my wife and i will stay in england where democracy is more important
3024297 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3024298 the minister informed me of the request of a small number of papuans who have been granted protection visas in australia of their desire to explore the possibility of them returning to papua
3024299 this of course is a matter for the papuans concerned and a matter between them and indonesia
3024300 this is a good reflection of papua both in terms of security and economic development
3024301 it appears the way the numbers have fallen means that the country liberals have done exceptional work but fallen short
3024302 i have said i have made mistakes obviously mistakes were made during the campaign
3024303 it was introduced before the advent of supercomputers the internet mobile phones digital cameras e commerce sophisticated surveillance devices and social networking websites all of which challenge our capacity to safeguard sensitive personal information

3024307 it was a dream come true it is surreal being out here the game went so quick
3024308 my teammates have been good to me over the past week or so and they want me to push them around thats my job when the forwards get slack
3024309 my defence wasnt on par there were a few big boys out there and its something i will work on my attack was sound although i got roughed up that is something you expect i wished i could have scored that try
3024310 he showed touches of class but hes not really ready
3024311 i wanted to see how he handled it for the future i was happy
3024312 his chip kick early showed there is no shortage of confidence
3024313 it doesnt appear that he will die wondering it would have been a bit scary and i imagine his mum and dad would have been a bit nervous
3024314 it is too early to estimate how much oil has been discovered in this well bore but we do believe that as a consequence of this discovery there is a relatively high probability that this area could contain enough oil and gas to double revus current reserves and contingent resources
3024315 at prices that can climb to 120 000 for one full page ad every missing page hits the magazines hard
3024316 everyone is facing 2009 cautiously im nervous and i think all magazine publishers in our field feel the same way whether they admit it or not
3024317 we train hundreds of people we spend 800 000 per election and people dont care its difficult to understand

3024327 we finished the si shoot and retreated to coronado island outside of san diego for a few days rest before heading south to cover the baja 1000 for micron needless to say this was quite different than the previous job i had in college working part time for a mid size daily newspaper joe reminded me of this as we sat having breakfast on the patio one morning overlooking the harbor and city surrounded by palm trees and beautiful weather
3024328 we needed a new camera bag so the whole camera bouncing off the asphalt would never happen again like we mentioned in that post i was leaning more towards the lowepro slingshot 200 aw the comments were very enthusiastic reviews about the bag we saw the bag and really liked it but decided its a bit on the unwieldy side for event photography

3024330 i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values

3024343 it was really a loophole technically speaking there is no such thing as a sports company here in saudi arabia what we did was we tried to go about it and do it through a commercial company and it worked
3024344 i think that the government is pro sports for women however some segments in society some cultures within the saudi society oppose it just like the driving situation theres nothing in our religion that says that women shouldnt drive but its more of a distorted interpretation of religion that is basically causing all this fuss over women driving or women playing sport
3024345 our prophet has preached that you have to teach your children swimming archery and equestrian
3024346 i think it found me the basketball sic just by chance one of my friends told me lets go play basketball i tried it once and i really liked it so i just kept on doing it it made me a better person i found myself that i could concentrate more on everything i did like on my studies and i could concentrate more on to talking to people really it changed my life it kept me going and not doing bad things it really helped me
3024347 here there are not a lot of things that women can do before i played basketball all i can do is maybe go to the mall and spend money and eat food when i discovered basketball its really something i enjoy doing its a good pastime not something im wasting my time on

3024354 you can definitely ship your luggage using fedex loaiza said
3024355 there is no way for fedex to verify the numbers of people doing so

3024357 shipping a 40 pound bag to the west coast probably costs 50 zidle said
3024358 a lot of people choose to do ground which is more economical loaiza said
3024359 delivery takes one to five business days based on weight and distance of the destination
3024360 shipping gets the box where it is supposed to go not hawaii and it will get there on time plus you dont have to worry about customs inspections at the airport
3024361 if someone just ships a bag ups charges an irregular fee because they cant put it on a conveyor belt zidle said
3024362 the fee is about equivalent to the cost of the box you would put it in so many people buy the box

3024367 edwards admission signals the end of the era in which traditional media set the limits of acceptable political journalism
3024368 ratified an end to the era in which traditional media set the agenda for national political journalism
3024369 follow this wherever it goes and peel this guy like an onion
3024370 illusion that traditional print and broadcast news organizations can establish the limits of acceptable political journalism joined the passenger pigeon on the roster of extinct americana
3024371 the times and most of the mainstream media seemed to be studiously ignoring a story of sex and betrayal involving a former democratic presidential candidate who remains prominent on the political stage
3024372 i hope you will find the time to tell me why this news story is not reported by your paper
3024373 i think every single candidate for president republican and democratic have lives personal lives that indicate something about what kind of human being they are and i think it is a fair evaluation to look at what kind of human beings each of us are
3024374 it will be a busy but exciting time and with a great team on hand i dont foresee any problems

3024380 natuurlijk ben ik tevreden met mijn belgisch record maar toch vloek ik
3024381 vooraf had ik gezegd dat ik eerst een belgisch record wilde en dat ik dan wel zou zien waar ik daarmee uitkwam maar zes honderdsten van de halve finales is echt niet veel
3024382 net na de finish dacht ik wel had ik maar aan het keerpunt dit of had ik maar dat maar ik heb een goede race gezwommen en kan mezelf niets verwijten er is enorm hard gezwommen ook al omdat de reeksen s avonds geprogrammeerd staan ik heb meteen al mijn volgend doel gesteld en dat is de finale over vier jaar op de spelen in londen
3024383 nu ga ik genieten ik blijf nog in peking tot het einde maar ik lig op de kamer met tom vangeneugden die zijn wedstrijd nog moet zwemmen dus ik ga eerst nog een beetje solidair blijven met hem

3024390 i think the price of rubber will not be affected much but the cpo price fell to below us 800 dollars per ton from 1 100 per ton but this problem can be overcome by increasing the export volume
3024391 the cpi price fluctuated sharply but prices of other commodities did not change too much as their export growth remained high namely about 38 percent

3024395 in deze fase onderzoeken wij in de eerste plaats de mogelijkheid om georgi politiek en humanitair te helpen
3024396 in zulke ernstige dossiers mag men zich niet overhaasten want er kunnen grote fouten worden begaan waarvoor men daarop lang moet betalen
3024397 inzet voor moskou niet in zuid osseti of abchazi ligt maar in georgi een onafhankelijke soevereine staat ten zuiden van zijn grenzen
3024398 zonder twijfel jammer genoeg burgers het slachtoffer zijn geworden van geschut tussen ons leger en de opstandelingen wij kennen hun precies aantal niet
3024399 dit soort uitspraken helpt ons niet veel vooruit ik denk dat er wel voor 2009 dingen kunnen gerealiseerd worden
3024400 een staatshervorming is mogelijk maar wie gelooft dat die er kan komen voor de regionale verkiezingen van juni 2009 kent niets van politiek
3024401 een bemiddelaar moet vooral bemiddelen dit soort uitspraken helpt ons niet veel vooruit ik denk dat er wel voor 2009 dingen kunnen gerealiseerd worden laat ons kijken in september waar we staan

3024408 deze cijfers geven nog maar eens de gevaarlijke richting aan die ons sociaal bestel uitgaat
3024409 de groei van de beschikbare middelen voor sociale uitgaven kan de toename van het aantal uitkeringsgerechtigden duidelijk niet bijbenen in belgi zijn er zeer veel uitkeringsgerechtigden waardoor het beschikbare bedrag per gerechtigde onder druk komt te staan
3024410 eerst en vooral ben ik u een verklaring schuldig voor mijn lange afwezigheid als kabouter heb je veel tijd om na te denken op een gegeven morgen werd het me te veel en voelde ik mijn voeten jeuken de wereld is een grote plek en er valt nu eenmaal meer te beleven dan het verkeer in de straat en katten die op je plassen daarom ging ik zelf op zoek naar wat avontuur mijn reis heeft me op drie continenten en in twaalf landen gebracht soms beleefde ik angstwekkende momenten maar ik heb het overleefd klein bedankje voor mijn reispartner trouwens met wie ik al deze avonturen beleefd heb
3024411 ik was al lang blij dat de ontvoerder hem niet door het raam gegooid heeft

3024415 youve got to find what you love and that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers if you havent found it yet keep looking dont settle as with all matters of the heart youll know when you find it
3024416 getting up in the morning and having work you love is what makes life different for people and if you get into a position where you really dont love what youre doing get off it its easy to be on someone elses track or something that sounds like a safety play

3024421 work you want to do instead of just have to do

3024440 a final agreement with her is that because she is not actually owning the company since she is already signing away her share transfers to us she is not investing any funds to run the company funds will be arranged by us and will be invested through her further more she will be paid yearly sum of 50 000 for her services of being our face and maintaining a basic management on our behalf

3024464 according to the reliable information held by the ministry of foreign affairs of georgia russian servicemen and separatists carry out mass arrests of peaceful civilians of georgian origin still remaining on the territory of the tskhinvali region and subsequently concentrate them on the territory of the village of kurta
3024465 to immediately take decisive and effective measures for the evacuation of this population from the conflict zone
3024466 the president also stressed that foreigners legally in russia including georgian citizens should not be subjected to any sort of discrimination and instructed the ministry of internal affairs to keep this matter under its control
3024467 in some ways its such a nice change to the regular tour we play in
3024468 i guess when i speak to some players now who didnt play in the olympics in 1996 and 2000 i know some of them have regrets
3024469 i would never want to miss an olympic games ever again if i would have a chance to compete in them
3024470 i think any time those guys have been playing in finals theyve been playing some pretty good tennis
3024471 so it would obviously raise the profile of the final if those two were to meet in the final
3024472 theyve had such a unique rivalry over the last two or three years as well and probably more so right at the moment because raf has started to go on top of roger obviously a lot of people know who those two are even if youre not that big of a tennis fan
3024473 im probably one of the few people who get sleepy at 7 oclock
3024474 i go to sleep really early ive been to the opening ceremonies at sydney and i was in a foul mood by the time 5 oclock came around and it just wasnt worth it after seven hours of standing ive got to preserve my body

3024576 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
3024577 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
3024578 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
3024579 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
3024580 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
3024581 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
3024582 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
3024583 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different

3024621 i am hopeful that nightline will continue to prosper its important for the news division to have the strongest alternative that we possibly can based on the strength of the work that we are doing and the ratings that we are achieving

3024627 weve identified and blocked the ability to link to the malicious websites from anywhere on facebook
3024628 enterprises need to have a presence on the web and they want to be relevant
3024629 but stories like this signal the need for sites like facebook and myspace to filter and be more proactive

3024632 theyre delicious sweet but fresh at the same time very well balanced
3024633 he scores goals as well i have observed him throughout his career from the time he was at ecco city greens to the time he moved to gunners his form has been consistent for him it is a matter of time i hope to use him in the near future i had plans for the likes of powell in the cosafa cup this year unfortunately we got knocked out in the first game the plan was to use an experienced squad so we win the first game and proceed to play in the next two games where some of these previously untested players would feature
3024634 it seems where he is working they rely a lot on him or he is the only one doing the job that he is doing he has shared with me some of his challenges i have called him to the last zebras training camp for instance and due to work commitments he was not released on wednesday this week i was talking to him about his availability for the next camp we will have to do a few things like seeing his supervisors it is not true that we have overlooked his abilities i for one believe in him if you recall oteng is one of our development products how can we develop him so well only to overlook him later it is only that some people do not contact us for explanations when they criticise us
3024635 however i believe that in mafoko we have a very good creative midfielder who can surge forward distribute the ball and control the tempo i have observed that he needs to be reminded about his importance in the team whenever he is not playing well the team suffers and when he is in his element the team does well i have said to him that due to his abilities we can win or lose games because of him
3024636 i see the problem coming to an end very soon i have advised him to train with other local sides the good thing is that next week he will be at the zebras training camp we want him to be in the best shape
3024637 we are looking at more cost effective ways to manage and develop the oyster card system that we expect will save millions over the next few years

3024639 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3024640 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3024641 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3024642 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication

3024644 two thousand south ossetians are already murdered and you must think that it would be very difficult to persuade the south ossetian government to voluntarily stay within the georgian state
3024645 up to august this year the russian government was trying to persuade the georgian government to sign a special legal agreement between georgia and south ossetia where it would be obligatory not to use military force to solve the issue

3024714 what great beauty you must possess then o sister of ravana to ensnare and enchant noble men how lovely you must be destroyed and disfigured though your face is
3024715 you insolent mortal you dare taunt me for what your precious brother has done you are more foolish than i thought

3024727 es importante tener el coraje de limitarse y la claridad al decidir las prioridades
3024728 aprender a ver que cosa es verdaderamente esencial donde se necesita mi presencia de sacerdote y no puedo delegar a nadie y al mismo tiempo debo aceptar humildemente cuando muchas cosas que tendr a que hacer y donde se exigir a mi presencia no se pueden realizar porque reconozco mis l mites creo que tal humildad ser comprendida por la gente

3024731 ning n sacerdote es un sacerdote solo somos un presbiterio y solo en esta comuni n con el obispo cada uno puede realizar su servicio
3024732 cuando era m s joven era m s severo dec a los sacramentos son los sacramentos de la fe y por lo tanto donde no hay fe no hay praxis de fe entonces el sacramento no puede ser conferido y luego discut a eso cuando era arzobispo de munich con mis p rrocos con el transcurso del tiempo he entendido que debemos seguir siempre el ejemplo del se or que era muy abierto tambi n con las personas al margen de israel de aquel tiempo era un se or de la misericordia bastante abierto seg n muchas autoridades oficiales con los pecadores acogi ndolos o dej ndose acoger en sus cenas atray ndoles a s en su comuni n
3024733 si podemos atisbar siquiera una peque a flama de deseo de la comuni n en la iglesia un deseo tambi n de estos ni os que quieren entrar en comuni n con jes s me parece que es justo ser m s amplio naturalmente cierto debe ser un aspectos de nuestra catequesis hacer entender que la comuni n la primera comuni n no es un hecho puntual sino que exige una continuidad de amistad con jes s un camino con jes s
3024734 en este sentido debemos naturalmente hacer lo posible en el contexto de la preparaci n a los sacramentos para llegar tambi n a los padres y as abrirles tambi n la sensibilidad a ellos en el camino que realizan los ni os deber an ayudar a sus hijos a seguir el propio deseo de entrar en amistad con jes s que es forma de la vida del futuro

3024775 were so lucky to live in a city where mayor bloomberg and his team want to show the world that new york city is a sport capital of the world and a model city for healthy living
3024776 the general interest as we can see is that people want to take over the streets people want to have fun and people want to meet out as equals and this creates a sense of belonging and this is what makes new york the greatest city in the world i think we have to applaud the mayor and the dot commissioner for having the guts sometimes its much easier to do nothing and then when you do nothing no one complains but they are doing things in making the city more human scale and i think thats whats exciting
3024777 the best part is watching people look up and enjoy buildings from the safety of the street instead of avoiding looking up because theyre trying to avoid collisions with motorists

3024871 but there are a lot of things you can do
3024872 its very important not to take the easy way out here
3024873 getting rid of the paper means youre taking away one of the things identity thieves love

3024875 people stared and pointed but i liked the breeze on my head it felt great
3024876 these people love you man theyll follow you anywhere youre like moses black moses
3024877 didnt say im the black moses of the black world they said of the music world
3024878 music is universal but sometimes presentation will restrict you or limit your range
3024879 glen campbell and jim webb were targeting the pop audience but when i did it i aimed to the black market but it was so big it went all over
3024880 one of the reasons you dont know my name is six minutes and six seconds is because of mr isaac hayes
3024881 hes really changed the face of music in so many ways the way he just kind of extended songs to the point where they would be strings for three minutes before the song even began
3024882 i used to dream just dream about being able to have a warm bed to sleep in and a nice square meal and some decent clothes to wear
3024883 i said sure even though the extent of my musical knowledge was chopsticks and heart and soul
3024884 wed get together the night before a session to write and we liked to have the artist present especially sam amp dave because we fed off them
3024885 it was record making at its most casual and rough hewn yet it produced hit after hit
3024886 nobody had any idea that we were producing legendary stuff we were getting a check and royalties and having fun and trying to impress girls
3024887 i came from a place where there wasnt a lot of joy
3024888 i decided to make other people laugh when there wasnt a lot of things to laugh about
3024889 my first thought was that we had lost one of the giants of comedy
3024890 its hard to imagine that a guy with so much talent and so much energy could be taken away at such an early age

3024912 its a chance for both candidates to really seem presidential big p presidential for the first time
3024913 the challenge is probably a little bit more pointed for obama than mccain
3024914 the truth is it probably wont have much impact at all the sad truth perhaps
3024915 russia should immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
3024916 russia has escalated the crisis in georgia through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3024917 i just dont think at that point it was useful to start assigning blame the first thing you need to do is stop the violence
3024918 obamas first statement was very weak and did not distinguish between the aggressor and the victim
3024919 i went to musikfest because it is one of the biggest community events in our district and a catalyst for the revitalization of the city of bethlehem
3024920 its disappointing that my opponent has time to politic in washington at big dollar lobbyist fundraisers but doesnt have the time to talk with folks at a local event
3024921 all people should have the freedom to say what they think
3024922 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
3024923 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
3024924 for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
3024925 free speech zones police arrest them for trespassing or disorderly conduct and then detain them until the president or vice president is out of the area and the media leave
3024926 over the past two years we have locked up a total 950 000 hectares of standing timber including this fujian deal at an agreed maximum acquisition price per cubic metre
3024927 this is beneficial to sino forest as we expect demand for fibre and its market price to grow continuously and steadily
3024928 its going to continue to focus on commodity prices and stability of the financials
3024929 the deal gives us access to some of the best minds in the world in the commodities sector
3024930 todays announcement is a testament to our success to date and offers huge promise for the future
3024931 for now its being used for the physical delivery but its failing to attract the liquidity from speculators
3024932 not only offers strong potential from an investment perspective but also constitutes a strategic partnership that will develop our footprint in the middle east
3024933 we had warning we knew gasoline prices would rise we watched as the emerging markets demanded more and more of the oil as a nation we did nothing as an industry we pretended that cheap oil would last forever
3024934 we had no plan to quickly import fuel efficient vehicles
3024935 there was no plan to make up the lost profit loss caused by the rapid drop in suv and truck sales
3024936 chrysler is in free fall continuing its decline from 2006 and is now in last place slightly below general motors but ford improved dramatically and jumped two ranks to fourth place
3024937 in the years weve been conducting this study weve never seen such dramatic year over year shifts in the rankings of the six domestic and foreign domestic automakers
3024938 dont do anything that you would not like to read about in the tabloids tomorrow morning
3024939 look we are good corporate citizens we are sustainable folks and mistakes were made we apologise we will make sure it does not happen again
3024940 lots of guys from bombay were at all three marches so whats this about us not participating its just that i think we wanted to do this a bit differently and no why cant we be different this way we can have our cake go for any of the other three marches and also have our own where other cities can participate this time we have large contingents coming from pune surat baroda bangalore ahmedabad delhi and kolkata
3024941 sure there are class community and other differences at least bombay handles it honestly i know there are diferences in kolkata delhi and bangalore too and they flare up quite frequently on the net here we sit down and thrash them out across the table there is a saying in hindi when there are so many vessels close together they do make noise
3024942 come on bombay is different it is the most corporate and business like of all indian cities do you think any other city would have thought of pink gandhi topis for the march it also shows indias pluralism
3024943 everyone should find their passion and make it work for them

3024952 hey iphone people anyone know how to resolve apps not moving from one computer to
3024953 the app store is the future this is so much fun ive never had so much adrenalin
3024954 purolator usas presence in this critical market gives businesses a new option among logistics providers
3024955 i am excited to introduce purolator usas extensive transportation options and unmatched commitment to customer service to the la region
3024956 we recently added intra u s service and it has already proven to be competitive to services offered by other small package providers
3024957 our detector actually flew to the edge of outer space and then back to ground and the whole time it worked perfectly
3024958 the purpose of the grant is not only to develop instrumentation for use in space flight but also to promote student interest in science and engineering through experiments with high altitude balloons
3024959 the best part about the project is that the detector was built from everyday materials and launched into near space from right here in our own backyard this proves you can accomplish really amazing things with simple materials
3024960 while many have thought that people wont be able to take medicines as well as they need to due to limited resources in poor countries our review of all studies on the topic strongly suggests that children in low income countries are able to maintain at least a comparable degree of art adherence if not better adherence than children in high income countries
3024961 healthcare systems need to carefully monitor how children with hiv take their medicines this kind of monitoring can be particularly difficult in low income countries so its very helpful for healthcare providers to understand how others do this monitoring and how well its working
3024962 we were not completely surprised to find the high rate of adherence to art in children in low income countries because it mirrors the results of adult studies but there is no question that it is reassuring to learn that even in settings where families face many challenges children are still able to adhere to a demanding yet essential medication regimen
3024963 our efforts to increase access to art must be coupled with research to inform strategies to deliver that therapy
3024964 the government here in california is banning a food product simply because its not healthy
3024965 what do you ban next bacon fat the possibilities are limitless
3024966 the troubling part of this is that those who are most likely to need these kinds of loans are the poor people who
3024967 det hele har v ret gennemg et og forsvarerne skulle nok have h rt bedre efter da ekspertvidnerne blev afh rt i retten
3024968 expect intel to focus even more marketing resources around that name and the core i7 products starting now
3024969 and this is very illegal so the following material is for educational use only
3024970 it is extremely important to maintain the security and integrity of the fare media systems
3024971 with an insecure compromised system even basic revenue controls to name one example become significantly challenging
3024972 if you prevent legitimate researchers from talking about their findings its not going to stop people from finding vulnerabilities its going to stop the good guys from talking about them and from learning from each other
3024973 the bad guys are still going to be looking for the vulnerabilities and still be finding them
3024974 what a pity that others cant be as enlightened as we are
3024975 for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
3024976 when i go out i like to wear very tight tops with no bra so my tits can bounce i like to look good so i wear something that will show my cleavage off i had a great time fucking xls stud he has one of the biggest cocks ive ever had you know a big girl like me appreciates a big dick for obvious reasons im passive so i need a guy who will tell me what to do and how to please him and your man did all that he showed me how to position myself to look my best while sucking and fucking his cock he told me that guys want to see a girls tits when she sucks cock porn sex isnt like regular sex where you orgasm at the same time i enjoyed being trained to be a dirty girl a plaything its just a fantasy ive had for a long time

3024978 that was important i knew if i holed it i probably would win the pga if i missed sergio would probably win the pga
3024979 so it was down to that and i hit a lovely putt i read it exactly how i wanted it and it did exactly what i expected
3024980 we morrisons have proved it over and over again when the price of crude and refined product falls our customers are the first to see the price at the pumps fall as well with no catches
3024981 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3024982 das war hervorragend nicht nur weil wir gewonnen haben sondern auch wie wir gewonnen haben wir sind auf dem besten weg das publikum nach dem abstieg aus der 2 liga zur ckzugewinnen ich denke wir werden noch viel spa haben an dieser mannschaft
3024983 wir werden jetzt einen weg finden mit dem wir ihn und den schatzmeister zufriedenstellen
3024984 das spiel gegen f rth war ein weiteres highlight in der noch kurzen saison meine mannschaft hat in sachen bereitschaft und leidenschaft keine w nsche offen gelassen der sieg war sicher nicht unverdient er hat allerdings viel kraft gekostet aber jetzt haben wir eine woche zeit um uns f r das spiel gegen union berlin zu erholen
3024985 das haben wir uns vorgenommen das ist unser ziel daf r werden wir alles erdenkliche tun wir haben es selbst in der hand aber das wird ein ganz harter brocken uns stehen noch einmal sehr sehr intensive 90 minuten bevor

3024991 what the bolivian people have expressed with their votes today is the consolidation of change
3024992 were here to move forward with the recovery of our natural resources the consolidation of nationalisation and the state takeover of companies
3024993 this referendum has defeated the remains of centralism has squashed the manipulation of the enemies of true change

3025000 slept with too many women done too many drugs and been to too many parties
3025001 they are extremely close a number of members of the hollywood community including brad pitt ben affleck and matt damon offered to help raise funds for barack but it was with george that he struck up this amazing affinity george has been giving him advice on things such as presentation public speaking and body language and he also emails him constantly about policy especially the middle east george is pushing him to be more balanced on issues such as us relations with israel george is pro palestinian and he is also urging barack to withdraw unconditionally from iraq if he wins its a very risky relationship his hope of becoming americas first black president depends heavily on winning over conservative voters and it would be suicidal for him to be perceived as a tool of a hollywood leftie which is how they regard george but they text and email each other almost every day and speak on the phone at least a couple of times a week often more
3025002 george is a master at crafting his own image and he is helping obama to hone his image both domestically and abroad he told me he feels obama is a once in a lifetime leader he is doing everything he can behind the scenes to bolster support in hollywood not just with other celebrities but with the money men at the studios
3025003 he has tried to keep the true extent of their involvement out of the press because he is frightened of alienating voters
3025004 i know they have spoken i view it as a private conversation
3025005 ive never seen anything like this in my career for software
3025006 phone differentiation used to be about radios and antennas and things like that we think going forward the phone of the future will be differentiated by software
3025007 hopefully we never have to pull that lever but we would be irresponsible not to have a lever like that to pull
3025008 one of my campers arrived with his belongings for the week in a small black wrinkled garbage bag he dug deep into the bag and pulled out two pairs of pants and two shirts i watched and waited there was nothing else not even a toothbrush at that moment my life changed i was overwhelmed and wanted to make a difference in this young lads life
3025009 i love seeing the joy on the faces of inner city kids when they are playing in the pool climbing and reaching the top of the rock wall and paddling a canoe for the first time and following camp through salvation army programs in local communities we continue to provide a safe place where they can have fun feel important and build relationships that will last a lifetime
3025010 some kids are tough to handle and we are here to love them unconditionally i had one camper who constantly locked himself in the shower using the wisdom of other leaders and a lot of patience we became good friends by the end of the week we have only one week to plant seeds for growth spiritually physically and emotionally in these kids
3025011 kids come to camp from physically and emotionally abusive homes here they are safe and know they are loved i have worked at a salvation army camp for seven years because i believe it its mission to help kids cope when they get home let them know they arent failures or stupid and that god loves them

3025027 numerous fish populations in the delta are crashing or in precipitous decline millions of salmon and other species continue to die annually as a result of both the direct and indirect impacts of the state and federal water project pumps despite the numerous efforts over the years to restore habitat for fish this legislation requires the state and federal projects that pump water out of the delta to mitigate for these losses which have huge negative impacts on our states fisheries and the commercial and sport fishing industries that contribute billions of dollars to our economy
3025028 cspa has repeatedly urged our government to correct the impacts caused by the water projects over the past fifty years
3025029 es una pena que algunos de nuestros socios no nos est n ayudando sino esencialmente entorpeci ndonos
3025030 quiero decir la transferencia de parte de los estados unidos del contingente georgiano en irak con aviones de transporte militar pr cticamente a la zona de conflicto
3025031 la escala misma de este cinismo es asombrosa el intento de transformar el blanco en negro el negro en blanco y de mostrar a las v ctimas de la agresi n como agresores y colocar la responsabilidad por las consecuencias de la agresi n sobre las v ctimas

3025033 they were two nice hard working respectable people who have come to the uk for the best of reasons to get a good education they had both worked hard while at newcastle university and both had done extremely well graduating with good degrees
3025034 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3025035 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003
3025036 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
3025037 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3025038 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3025039 when they start to change their behaviors and really focus only on that number on the scale only on their weight thats when it gets dangerous everything you do during pregnancy including your diet and exercise should be for your health not for your weight
3025040 calorie restriction is linked with growth retardation and birth defects and with vitamin deficiencies both for the mother and baby whats interesting about vitamin deficiencies is say for instance with calcium deficiency the baby will probably get what he or she needs but thatll be at the expense of the mothers bones so you really have to be careful with that
3025041 from the mothers mental and physical health to better deliveries better postpartum recoveries even a higher i q for the baby
3025042 but you dont want to overdo it you never want to exercise to the point where youre not getting enough oxygen because thats linked with neurological defects in the baby
3025043 you shouldnt exercise to the point of exhaustion if you need to throw yourself on the couch afterwards just to rejuvenate youve done too much you should feel invigorated after your workout not exhausted
3025044 i think weve never before been more kind of obsessed with celebrity culture and with celebrity pregnancies as well its not unusual to see pictures of these celebrities the day before and the day after birth and theyre looking super humanly fit theyre really incredible
3025045 but you also have to remember a lot of these celebrities are just genetically blessed they have the best dieticians nutritionists trainers etc they certainly have an advantage
3025046 type 2 which is associated with unhealthy lifestyles and obesity and figures show the highest percentage of diabetes attributable deaths were in areas with a higher than average proportion of people over the age of 40
3025047 in cases where there is a long history of resistance this is an indicator of death so it is important to try all the possibilities
3025048 probably the largest database of its kind in the world
3025049 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3025050 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
3025051 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
3025052 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
3025053 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
3025054 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
3025055 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake
3025056 there can be big savings it will cost around 4 500 to isolate a kilogram of vanillin which flavours everything from ice cream to cola drinks directly from vanilla beans but in the lab it can be synthesised for less than 6 per kilogram typically using by products from the paper or petrochemical industries
3025057 an orange juice flavouring to improve slovenian oj is labelled highly flammable harmful
3025058 the food industry is already getting excited at the prospect of tiny nanotechnology robots or nanobots instead of harvesting grain and cattle for carbohydrates and protein nanobots could assemble the desired steak or flour from carbon hydrogen and oxygen atoms present in the air as water and carbon dioxide marvin rudolph director of dupont food industry solutions which advises ingredients companies predicted breathlessly in food technology magazine no need then to nurture such inefficient and expensive food sources as cows and plants if new industrial processes can simply replicate their atomic structures in pre flavoured shrink wrapped packages but dr rudolphs vision went further nanobots present in foods could circulate through the blood system cleaning out fat deposits and killing pathogens he suggested
3025059 the tiny polymers that cause the effect are not yet food grade but that hurdle he says could be overcome within two years and by using ultrasound or radio frequencies to trigger these nanocapsules we could determine the colour fragrance or taste of our fruit drink or wine
3025060 the food industrys increasing use of nanotechnology in ingredients additives and packaging has prompted two new reports calling for better consumer protection the reports one a review led by uk government scientists and the other by an international lobby group add to growing calls for better safety assessment and regulation of nanotechnology in food
3025061 dr qasim chaudhry from the uk governments central science laboratory in york and his colleagues say engineered nano sized particles and other structures are being used to develop new tastes textures nutritional qualities as well as improve shelf life and traceability of food products

3025067 in our discussions with publishers we acknowledge that their e book initiatives to date may not have required per format identification equally we do not believe that many publishers see their current e book arrangements remaining fixed as their only route to market for digital content for the long term we believe that hardwiring bibliographic and identification practice to the limited requirements of current initiatives and experiments runs the risk of storing up inhibitors to future flexibility and adds potential costs of system re engineering down the line on these grounds we recommend that publishers adopt the most flexible policy now on product identification

3025089 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3025090 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3025091 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3025092 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3025093 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3025094 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3025095 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3025096 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

3025107 there were matches last season when late goals hurt us but maybe things are changing
3025108 last season we were pushing for the play offs around six points off it and when you look back there were matches we drew when we should have won
3025109 this match looked as if it would fizzle out to a draw but we kept going and earned our reward

3025150 this single gene variation is potentially only one of many factors influencing such a complex trait as anxiety still to identify this first candidate for genes associated with an anxiety prone personality is a step in the right direction
3025151 it might be possible to prescribe the right dose of the right drug relative to genetic make up to treat anxiety disorders
3025152 we used the startle reflex because its a very old evolutionary indication of anxiety its not something you can manipulate or fake the startle response is stronger when they were watching a negative image and there was a significantly greater startle response from the met met women compared with the rest of the group
3025153 anxiety is a very complex phenomenon and many genes are responsible for it but this particular genetic variation although involved in a small part of the anxiety response is an essential part of it

3025171 if we can well run it every play screens come down to the quarterback and timing
3025172 if you have a quarterback who can get the ball there find those tight spaces without getting the ball knocked down or sacked then youre a good screen team we had a good one in green bay obviously a lot of it is dependent on the quarterback and his timing between him and the running backs certainly the linemen have to block and the rhythm of the play is important but i think they can be great plays for us and all of our backs are pretty good at it

3025194 much worse than that is the massive control government would have over our economy and our lives congress might decide that since tobacco use is unhealthy it might not issue allowances to tobacco companies while many americans might applaud that how many would like congress to refuse to issue allowances to companies that produce foods that some people deem unhealthy such as french fries sodas canned soups and potato chips congress might deny or threaten to deny allowances to companies that in their opinion didnt hire enough women and minorities the possibilities for control over our lives would be endless and could include nuisance type edicts such a requiring us to buy a permit to barbeque in our backyard

3025211 the tiny republic of georgia which straddles the land bridge between the worlds largest lake and the largest inland sea is home to five million people both in population and in size it is smaller than the other georgia most americans know and yet that miniscule country has provided 2 000 soldiers to assist our mission in iraq why the answer to that question is obvious when you look at a list of countries who have forces here among the thirty nations are all three baltic republics armenia azerbaijan kazakhistan and the ukraine each one a former soviet republic along with several former soviet bloc countries including bulgaria the czech republic hungary poland and romania these are all countries who knew oppression they knew fear and they knew death at the hands of dictators they knew one other thing too they knew the power of america to transform a hopeless situation they knew that america didnt abandon them sure it took a while but they knew that america would persevere and that they would persevere and that they would win and they did win thats why when in the sixth year of this war when much of the rest of the world has abandoned america when even many americans have abandoned america they who know best the horror of oppression and the strength of the american spirit have not abandoned us here in iraq albania bosnia herzegovina macedonia slovenia and all the rest who have been allowed out out from behind the iron curtain are now looking at america to watch what we do for georgia

3025220 india offers strong opportunities for growth as livejournal seeks to expand upon its global reach
3025221 livejournal is a natural platform for creating and sharing meaningful content around literature activism education news and politics quick tales flash fiction contest is the natural first step for us to seed many such initiatives and communities in india
3025222 flash fiction also called micro fiction short shorts and many other names demands that the writer tell a story with all the classical elements a beginning middle and end a conflict and resolution a credible protagonist but within a very limited number of words which may mean that these elements are implied rather than made explicit it is an ancient form but has grown hugely in popularity in these attention deficit times with the growth of the internet if standard short fiction is like a one day international think of the quick tales contest as the 20 twenty of contemporary story telling
3025223 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia

3025225 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3025226 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia

3025482 accents are intricately tied into our own sense of identity its interesting that those with distinct cultural or class identities are more satisfied with the way they speak and its precisely those accents that the rest of us want to acquire the fact is that english as spoken in the uk is incredibly dynamic precisely because of the regional variations in the way we speak we are still seeing new words being added to our d2 systems dictionary at the rate of thousands a week 70 of those words are not even contained in published english dictionaries
3025483 our clients are extremely happy with the results and we believe that adding spinvox to our service has the potential to change the way companies think about gathering opinions

3025496 parents do not have a constitutional right to homeschool their children
3025497 we conclude that california statutes permit homeschooling as a species of private school education
3025498 the california appeals court shocked the nation with its ruling in february
3025499 we decided as part of a broad survey of more than 1 200 adult americans to get their reaction and found that 61 percent strongly agreed that the constitution guarantees the right of parents to homeschool and another 25 percent agreed somewhat
3025500 americans appear to believe that parents not the government should decide whether or not they should homeschool
3025501 a primary purpose of the educational system is to train school children in good citizenship patriotism and loyalty to the state and the nation as a means of protecting the public welfare
3025502 as is the case with polling research we are not asking if something is true but rather what people believe
3025503 and it is important to note that americans do believe that schooling at home leads to issues with social skills and this is a perception that homeschooling families need to overcome
3025504 the scorpions service the rich and do plea bargains while core criminals run around the streets

3025507 yes working for the government will be viewed as a reactionary step
3025508 but a person who knew how much i was persecuted by the very comrades that i defended would agree that i needed an indefinite sabbatical leave because working for a private company would mean continuing to attack other comrades and them attacking me
3025509 since private companies allow workers to hold political office and government allows secret membership i have chosen an employer where i will enjoy peace of mind from political gossips and character assassinations sic for an indefinite period of time
3025510 we apply for an interdict to stop a wrong that has been done
3025511 the applicant is not a mere busy body without interest in this matter the deponents of the affidavits are not eye witnesses
3025512 not even one licencee has tendered evidence to indicate urgency the court cannot venture into the realm of speculation
3025513 it is not a business entity the parties have no issue before this court
3025514 we are saying there is no urgency in the papers before court the licencees have not been deposed an affidavit to confirm urgency
3025515 the founding affidavit falls far too short of establishing urgency
3025516 the ngc which received cabinet approval on july 24 2008 is broad based and is drawn from the government civil society parliament the judiciary professional bodies and other stakeholders
3025517 the report will show case our achievements strengths weaknesses and challenges in implementing governance standards as a nation

3025520 but the problem is greatest in the realm of sexual violence because rapes and other sexual assaults on american indian women are overwhelmingly interracial more than 80 percent of indian victims identify their attacker as non indian sexual violence against white and african american women in contrast is primarily intraracial and american indian women who live on tribal lands are more than twice as likely to be raped or sexually assaulted as other women in the united states justice department statistics show
3025521 rapes against american indian women are also exceedingly violent weapons are used at rates three times that for all other reported rapes

3025527 the message was that dont say i dont want to serve when it suited you because on other occasions you give an impression that you accept deployment it was a matter of reminding them of party discipline which i think is fair
3025528 that is why there has not been any minister announcing his or her retirement
3025529 the advice was to all cadres of the movement who are in government that they can be retained or redeployed they shouldnt make announcements that are not in line with the ancs policies all cadres are eligible for the party nomination list
3025530 the anc is quite right in saying they have the authority to deploy members to various positions of cabinet as far as i am aware theres not a single branch of the anc throughout the country that has proposed me to be on the nec list my position remains the same that i will not be available for cabinet positions
3025531 strong demand in the epc market for steam turbines has resulted in epc contractors insisting on terms and conditions for project financed projects of the scale of the mmamabula energy project that we dont believe will be acceptable to lenders without changes to risk allocations

3025538 they media companies foresee googles becoming a powerful rival that not only owns a growing number of content properties including youtube the top online video site and blogger a leading blogging service but also holds the keys to directing users around the web if in fact a google property is taking money away from googles partners that is a real problem said wenda harris millard the co chief executive of martha stewart living omnimedia money of course is very much at issue the lower a site ranks in search results the less traffic it receives from search engines with a smaller audience the site earns less money from advertising

3025619 a key element of the two carriers merger plan it would take effect when the proposed delta northwest merger closes and would bring northwest pilots pay up to the level of delta pilots
3025620 there are those who would suggest that we would be better served by simply rejecting this agreement that all we have to do is simply go back and get more
3025621 or they argue the agreement favors the northwest pilots over the delta pilots in one respect or another but upon closer analysis these views are many times based on a misunderstanding of the agreement a misinterpretation of its terms a failure to acknowledge todays economic realities or simply anger

3025837 this is particularly important for athletes who take part in a series of events

3025839 when they start to change their behaviors and really focus only on that number on the scale only on their weight thats when it gets dangerous everything you do during pregnancy including your diet and exercise should be for your health not for your weight
3025840 calorie restriction is linked with growth retardation and birth defects and with vitamin deficiencies both for the mother and baby whats interesting about vitamin deficiencies is say for instance with calcium deficiency the baby will probably get what he or she needs but thatll be at the expense of the mothers bones so you really have to be careful with that
3025841 from the mothers mental and physical health to better deliveries better postpartum recoveries even a higher i q for the baby
3025842 but you dont want to overdo it you never want to exercise to the point where youre not getting enough oxygen because thats linked with neurological defects in the baby

3025844 i think weve never before been more kind of obsessed with celebrity culture and with celebrity pregnancies as well its not unusual to see pictures of these celebrities the day before and the day after birth and theyre looking super humanly fit theyre really incredible

3025855 its not that people think mccain will win its that they are realizing that mccain could win
3025856 this election is about barack obama not john mccain its about whether barack obama passes muster every poll shows that people want a democratic president the problem is theyre not sure they want barack obama
3025857 this is a country that is looking for a fundamentally different direction and john mccain offers nothing but the status quo
3025858 the idea that obama was going to win in a blowout was always preposterous
3025859 a big piece of this of course is whether white people are going to support a black guy if obama is a tall skinny white guy named paul jones its a different story
3025860 its the uncertainty that kills me we know its going to be factor but how big a factor
3025861 watch michigan the democrats think theyve got it but they dont
3025862 obama should be killing mccain there but theres a lot more racial tension in michigan than in other states
3025863 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3025864 but it will be interesting to see if mccains able to close the economic gap

3025919 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3025920 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

3025932 we are in a tough pool and have to win every game so i am definitely happy to win this one
3025933 i cant be happy when we missed so many goals it is unacceptable at the start of the tournament we had seven penalty corners and wasted all of them
3025934 it makes it difficult for us now but we will fight all the way
3025935 i am not surprised we had problems getting into the game at the start
3025936 my performance was perfect and ideal my time was excellent its what i have been hoping for
3025937 when i saw the screen i could see the time as 59 90 and i thought that was terribly slow but when i looked again it was 58
3025938 i know india was waiting for this for a long time and so was i i narrowly missed a medal at athens so i knew i would be in with a chance if i focussed on the job
3025939 it is a scary story made more scary by the fact that most people in america dont understand what the problems are
3025940 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
3025941 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
3025942 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
3025943 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
3025944 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
3025945 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
3025946 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
3025947 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
3025948 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
3025949 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
3025950 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
3025951 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
3025952 educate people that the climate crisis is both urgent and solvable
3025953 we ensure that every product or service they offer through the campaign makes it easier or cheaper for you to do your bit and help tackle climate change
3025954 you dont need any proof you just see it its in here everyday
3025955 you can see the rivers turning color and dead fish
3025956 i see where i live i live in costa rica at the moment and its very beautiful and clean
3025957 i see the difference about how the us is treating all its resources
3025958 i ride a bike i dont drive a car little things but i still us too much
3025959 its the price of gas i think that has made people think a little bit more about improving their lifestyle and giving back to the earth
3025960 my goal is to show people how to cook local produce
3025961 it doesnt have to be transported all the way across the country or across the globe
3025962 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
3025963 people can relate to other people that they know or people in a similar circumstance they are therefore more inclined to take a chance and do something different
3025964 green marketing is totally an increased buzzword the average person doesnt check to see if the word holds any weight with the business
3025965 people should look at what companies are actually doing to be sustainable
3025966 everyday i would take an industrial sized trash bag and at least fill it to the brim with paper and cardboard despite the fact that there were recycling bins available on campus
3025967 the only real trash that we had was coffee grinds and those are biodegradable
3025968 hey im changing so i can get votes in texas or arizona
3025969 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
3025970 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
3025971 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
3025972 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
3025973 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
3025974 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
3025975 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
3025976 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
3025977 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
3025978 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
3025979 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
3025980 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
3025981 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
3025982 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
3025983 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
3025984 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
3025985 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
3025986 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
3025987 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3025988 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3025989 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3025990 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3025991 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3025992 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3025993 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3025994 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3025995 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
3025996 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
3025997 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
3025998 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
3025999 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
3026000 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3026001 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
3026002 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
3026003 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
3026004 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
3026005 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
3026006 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
3026007 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
3026008 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
3026009 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
3026010 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
3026011 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
3026012 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
3026013 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
3026014 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
3026015 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
3026016 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
3026017 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
3026018 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
3026019 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
3026020 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
3026021 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
3026022 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
3026023 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
3026024 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
3026025 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
3026026 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
3026027 liberals want illegal aliens and felons to vote they benefit from such rampant fraud
3026028 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3026029 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3026030 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3026031 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3026032 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3026033 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3026034 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3026035 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3026036 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3026037 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3026038 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3026039 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3026040 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3026041 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3026042 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3026043 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3026044 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3026045 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3026046 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3026047 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3026048 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3026049 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3026050 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3026051 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3026052 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
3026053 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
3026054 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
3026055 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
3026056 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
3026057 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
3026058 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
3026059 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
3026060 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
3026061 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
3026062 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
3026063 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
3026064 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3026065 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3026066 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3026067 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3026068 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
3026069 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
3026070 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
3026071 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
3026072 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
3026073 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
3026074 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
3026075 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
3026076 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
3026077 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
3026078 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
3026079 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
3026080 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
3026081 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
3026082 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
3026083 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
3026084 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
3026085 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
3026086 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
3026087 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3026088 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3026089 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3026090 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3026091 just so you all know we did set a record
3026092 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3026093 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3026094 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3026095 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3026096 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3026097 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3026098 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3026099 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3026100 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3026101 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
3026102 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
3026103 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
3026104 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
3026105 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
3026106 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3026107 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3026108 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
3026109 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
3026110 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
3026111 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country
3026112 gore will consume a lot more fuel driving to and from the lake than he will ever use cruising on this houseboat
3026113 climate confusion how global warming hysteria leads to bad science pandering politicians and misguided policies that hurt the poor
3026114 we are a debt relief agency amp have proudly helped people file for bankruptcy for over 30 yrs
3026115 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
3026116 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
3026117 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
3026118 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
3026119 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
3026120 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
3026121 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
3026122 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
3026123 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
3026124 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3026125 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
3026126 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
3026127 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
3026128 theres frustration there because theyre watching these childish ad campaigns and they know exactly how to answer it but theyre powerless to do so
3026129 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
3026130 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
3026131 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
3026132 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
3026133 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3026134 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3026135 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3026136 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3026137 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3026138 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3026139 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3026140 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3026141 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3026142 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
3026143 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
3026144 well im voting for barack obama hell help with global warming
3026145 it would take as long as 15 years that is until 2023 to go from starting a pilot plant to proving the technology will work
3026146 we have to store radioactive waste for 250 000 years
3026147 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
3026148 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
3026149 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
3026150 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
3026151 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
3026152 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
3026153 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
3026154 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
3026155 ive starting using the egg trick and ive been able to lower my commuting fuel costs by more than 10 per cent
3026156 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
3026157 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
3026158 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet
3026159 carbon tax alone wont solve climate change but we cant solve climate change without carbon pricing
3026160 areas where the sun shines and the wind blows to the cities in the east and west that need the electricity
3026161 alberta and saskatchewan for example have some of the best wind and solar resources and could benefit from better interconnections with b c and manitoba respectively
3026162 without transmission and without storage a utility cannot put more than a few new percentage points into the system
3026163 nuclear power is not renewable power its mined out of the earth and its toxic
3026164 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
3026165 its certainly technically and technologically doable and this is the sad thing it may not be politically doable
3026166 i just want to see an understanding that gore was right about the first inconvenient truth global warming but we have to recognize the second inconvenient truth which is that we dont have the means to do it right now
3026167 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
3026168 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
3026169 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
3026170 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
3026171 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
3026172 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of that has got to change
3026173 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
3026174 this will give the true picture so there will be no misconceptions that can hurt malaysias image
3026175 any judgment or directive by a court or the legal department should be upheld foreign countries should understand the malaysian legal system and that we do uphold the rule of law
3026176 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3026177 i think he should concentrate on his environmental pursuits instead of interfering anyway he has gore d us before
3026178 various departments are engaged in this exercise the home minister will be annexing certain documents and i believe the home ministry will also be producing certain reports to augment the submission
3026179 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
3026180 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
3026181 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
3026182 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
3026183 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
3026184 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
3026185 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
3026186 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
3026187 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
3026188 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
3026189 oh yeah but hes not as good as al gore if only al gore had won did i tell you how much i like al gore
3026190 its no good running a pig farm badly for 30 years while saying really i was meant to be a ballet dancer by then pigs will be your style
3026191 in their patriotism and in their fidelity to their civic duties catholics will feel themselves bound to promote the true common good they will make the weight of their convictions so influential that as a result civil authority will be justly exercised and laws will accord with moral precepts and the common good
3026192 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine

3026207 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
3026208 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices

3026241 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices

3026377 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3026378 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
3026379 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3026380 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3026381 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3026382 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3026383 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
3026384 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
3026385 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
3026386 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
3026387 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it

3026406 its a technology space we felt we needed to own
3026407 we will be creating demand for them and giving them a broader set of solutions
3026408 what this does is strengthen the portfolio strategy we already had were not moving away from our network edge strategy
3026409 we will look at the opportunities out there in the market and understand how it impacts our customers
3026410 greyhound passengers need only reach under the seats in front of them to learn about the myriad attractions offered by our nations highway rest stops and bridge underpasses

3026414 return on participation measuring social media strategies in tech pr
3026415 we are very excited to present such a solid lineup at this years t3 pr conference
3026416 we feel that weve brought together some of the brightest and most innovative minds in technology pr and marketing today there is no other event that offers this concentration of best practices creative ideas and practical training for the tech pr practitioner
3026417 last years conference sold out immediately and solidified t3 as being the must attend event for public relations professionals working in technology and for those individuals wanting to stay current on the latest tools and best practices
3026418 we have the entire tech pr ecosystem in one room leading tech pr pros journalists bloggers and marketers its also a fantastic opportunity to network and exchange ideas with colleagues from agencies as well as corporations nonprofits and government
3026419 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3026420 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3026421 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3026422 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication
3026423 front man joe has a pleasantly raspy voice and the band somehow manages to steer clear of syrupy ballads you might normally associate with a disney sanctioned act of christian rockers well for the most part anyway the title track details brother nicks struggle with diabetes in slow motion complete with tears and an unintentional nod to joni mitchell with the line you dont know what you got til its gone although they attempt to wrestle with other teenage traumas the brothers are at their best on the brilliantly mindless single burnin up now if only the kids would shut up long enough to listen
3026424 sure lead single burnin up is an excellent attempt at maroon 5 style pop funk complete with a killer latin percussion breakdown and jack johnson will probably lightly tap himself for not coming up with love bug first but too many of these songs get bogged down in chord changes and lyrics likely to sound worn out even to a 10 year old you dont know what youve got till its gone nick sings in the title track im sure the jonases are worn out these little dudes work like crazy but though miley cyrus manages it on her new one making exhaustion seem interesting is no easy feat pick up the phone a whole fleet of disney pop pros waiting to help
3026425 parents will be relieved to know that the jonas brothers are about as wholesome and innocent a band as you can hope for these days there may not be a ton of variation in the music but the messages are thoroughly positive and life affirming
3026426 i dont think its surprising the argument for civil unions was all about taking down boundaries
3026427 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3026428 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3026429 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3026430 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3026431 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3026432 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3026433 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3026434 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3026435 great time i think the whole event worked as well as could be expected good turnout the weather was fantastic and gave everyone a vision of what the future could be i

3026465 part of the reason why senator obama is in the shape he is in today is because hes failed to run a positive campaign hes run a negative campaign hes claimed to be something new and different and yet given these you know it is really beyond the pale to sit there and insinuate that senator mccain is somehow going to attack him for being black which is what he did for over a month
3026466 does he need to separate himself from your old boss george bush separate himself more

3026561 the real lessons of the housing crisis have gotten lost its portrayed as the financial system run amok the housing market became a casino but it ignores a larger and more important truth our infatuation with homeownership embedded in dozens of government policies has turned housing once a justifiable symbol of the american dream into something of a national nightmare as a society were overinvesting in real estate we build and buy too many extra large homes mcmansions if you will but when you subsidize something you get more of it than you otherwise would thats our housing policy

3026593 ich bitte sie um verst ndnis dass es zum jetzigen zeitpunkt hierzu keine weiteren statements von herrn becker gibt
3026594 es handelt sich um eine unterlassungsklage durch die die brasilianer verpflichtet werden sollen rafinha nicht mehr bei olympia einzusetzen
3026595 wir haben eigentlich gehofft dass wir diese unselige geschichte ohne weitere klagen zu ende bringen k nnen leider gibt uns die cbf durch ihr verhalten keine andere m glichkeit
3026596 dann gehen wir wieder vor den cas wir stehen in dieser sache wie eine eins so kann man nicht mit uns umgehen
3026597 meiner ansicht nach sollten wir das turnier bei der heutigen qualit t der u 23 spieler als u 23 turnier belassen die abstellung dann aber zur pflicht machen und das gewohnheitsrecht durch einen entschluss ersetzen
3026598 wenn kacar jetzt nicht auf den weg geschickt wird werden wir klagen
3026599 es gibt keinen grund ein risiko einzugehen und den spieler nur eine sekunde l nger dort zu lassen
3026600 wenn das stimmt komme ich sofort zur ck nach berlin ich bin profi und werde das tun was mein verein will
3026601 es gab eine klare abmachung wenn die nicht eingehalten wird behalten wir uns juristische schritte vor
3026602 summer is the time to regroup and to rest but so far this summer has been one of burning the midnight oil
3026603 our business is booming customer satisfaction is very high there is an innate expectation of we will do better than we did last year
3026604 alex ovechkin i think is a historic player and will go down as one of those great players and great personalities
3026605 were fortunate in that hes a remarkably gifted talent but he has crossed over
3026606 i think what leagues need to be successful usually is some alchemy in that having great teams in big markets becomes important but having great stars on those great teams makes it doubly important
3026607 my belief is that the will have great teams for a long period of time and well play each other a lot hopefully well meet each other in the playoffs because thats the crucible and thats when alchemy happens and where legends are made our guy understands that very much so
3026608 we made the playoffs and alex became mvp and had all four trophies hart maurice richard lester b pearson and art ross becoming the first player to do that but he said exactly the right thing
3026609 he said that he would trade all four for one stanley cup he knows to make that next jump from being a wondrous talent to going to that next plain you have to win in the playoffs
3026610 i think if you threw me into the dallas lineup in that series against detroit it definitely would have made a difference
3026611 i think you always work to help your team reach the top and that includes getting guys to play their best and remain healthy
3026612 its a matter of taking the group of players we have and putting them in a situation where they can be complementary and produce our young guys came in and developed well last year no disrespect to the other teams in our conference but i feel we can compete with all of them
3026613 i know ive had my battles with brenden in the past but the good thing about hockey players is the fact once you become teammates that stuff is all forgotten
3026614 itll be exciting to play on the same team maybe even on the same line you almost have more respect for the guys youve battled in the past even a guy like steve ott who i know ill enjoy playing with itll probably bring my penalty minutes down a bit because it seems i always ended up fighting or scrapping with one of those guys itll be tough for other teams to play against me brenden modano ribeiro and richards and ott its going to be a lot of fun
3026615 ive proven myself in the playoffs and thats the part of the season that i consider the most exciting time
3026616 i feel i can bring a physical presence whether thats a kick start or bringing something else to the table i feel itll certainly help our chances against a team like detroit or san jose or anaheim or whoever we face in the playoffs
3026617 this is a better team than the one i formerly played on so thats a big attraction and very important to me because being able to win provides more opportunities
3026618 the relationship i had with brett and now with his moving on to management and the faith he has in me that i can come in and help the team win also played a big role
3026619 brett was my favorite player growing up and then 10 years later i end up living with him
3026620 i probably took on his persona a little bit and i dont think i was really ready to do that but as far as watching a guy play and being able to read the game he was certainly beneficial
3026621 i think im coming to a team thats happy to have me and expecting a lot out of me im willing to take it to the next level and i think i proved what level i can take my game in new york
3026622 when you put the jersey on you represent the team and the city and i certainly do cross the line at times but its not out of anything other than wanting to win the game
3026623 i think im coming to a team thats happy to have me and expecting a lot out of me
3026624 its a nice feeling knowing i could be in a situation where players will be together for a four or five year span
3026625 thats what you want to have an opportunity to win two or three cups in a four or five year period detroit is a perfect example theyve kept their nucleus together and brought in a few other guys and it has worked

3026632 im kind of leaning towards obama but hes a rookie you know and im kind of worried about that
3026633 hillary said shes the candidate for people who need a president
3026634 in other words people who dont need a president can afford to vote for obama because hes exciting represents change etc
3026635 the mother that had to cut back on groceries because of rising gas prices the guy i met who couldnt fill up his gas tank to go on a job search
3026636 obama could use a little more empathy and a little less lecture
3026637 im hoping obama would be a better steward of the economy but im undecided
3026638 i dont like mccain mccain is bush and weve already had this one you know what i mean
3026639 base are independent leaning voters concerned by overspending in washington
3026640 obama can battle mccain in appealing to those kind of voters very well
3026641 mccain hes be a good military leader but i dont know as far as running the economy
3026642 its hard to say at this point whod handle the economy better
3026643 we need change so whoevers going to make the biggest change

3026647 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3026648 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
3026649 putting the horse first veterinary recommendations for ending the soring of tennessee walking horses
3026650 the soring of tennessee walking horses is one of the most egregious forms of equine abuse and it is time for it to be brought to an end
3026651 ending soring is a top priority of the hsus and the aaep paper echoes many of the same concerns weve raised and the changes weve been recommending we are very pleased that aaep has taken a stand for the welfare of the horse and believe its influence will be a valuable asset in the continued fight to end soring we urge the walking horse industry to immediately end the cruel treatment of its horses
3026652 americas three great national challenges our economy national security and climate change can all be addressed by switching to renewable energy
3026653 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together choosing the right path and repowering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
3026654 we all know our country faces tough challenges a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
3026655 we can switch to smarter cleaner forms of power and take advantage of free energy sources like the wind and sun the answer is simple power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within ten years
3026656 we are taking this message to a national audience because this goal is both ambitious and attainable
3026657 meeting the challenge to repower america will deliver the affordability stability and confidence our economy needs as well as a healthy environment and it will generate millions of good american jobs that cant be outsourced
3026658 but the gap between the married and never married is closing especially for men
3026659 the times they are a changin marital status and health differentials from 1972 to 2003
3026660 politicians and scholars continue to debate the value of marriage for americans
3026661 with some going so far as to establish social programs and policies to encourage marriage among those socials groups less inclined to marry particularly the poor and minorities
3026662 encouraging marriage in order to promote health may be misguided
3026663 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
3026664 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
3026665 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
3026666 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
3026667 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
3026668 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
3026669 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
3026670 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
3026671 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me

3026695 you dont look at john and say who the heck is he hes a veteran hes a guy who got pretty banged up in vietnam he can deal with crisis theres some uncertainty about senator obama
3026696 the fact that hes african american is a big deal i do expect and hope that hillary is the nominee of the party but i hope hes used in some way if he happens to be the nominee of the party and ends up being president i think his capacity to influence in a positive way the behavior of a lot of underperforming black youth today is very important and hes the only one who can reach them
3026697 its probably not something that appeals to him but i like the fact that his name is barack hussein obama and that his father was a muslim and that his paternal grandmother is a muslim theres a billion people on the planet that are muslims and i think that experience is a big deal
3026698 its going to bear some wonderful fruit when i was in australia they had a placenta tree that was on the river it was gorgeous all the placentas of all that tribe all that clan whatever aboriginal tribe that was all the placentas went under that one tree and it was this huge behemoth of just health and strength this tree was just growing taller and stronger above the rest of mother nature around it

3026722 hier geht es darum der postsowjetischen territorialgeschichte rechnung zu tragen denn die ost west zuspitzung bis hin zur offensiven strategie einer nato mitgliedschaft f r georgien und andere ex su republiken provoziert russland unangemessen deshalb muss darauf gedr ngt werden dass eine waffenstillstandsvereinbarung von beiden seiten angenommen und durchgesetzt wird danach sieht es momentan leider nicht aus die truppen aus dem konfliktgebiet m ssen unter internationaler beobachtung abgezogen und politische verhandlungen eingeleitet werden dabei muss es auch darum gehen die nato erweiterung auf eis zu legen und f r s dossetien und abchasien eine v lkerrechtsvertr gliche regelung zu finden

3026730 we should start 2009 by calling a referendum on whether to approve the states new constitution policy

3026734 the us mission is an important one and is much more than a sales outlet our goal in the us is the same as elsewhere to fulfil the markets need for a new supplier service based on a different kind of packaging innovation we are extremely confident that this approach will lead to us establishing a us manufacturing site within a short space of time
3026735 we are equipping it to the highest possible standards aiming to make sirane the safest and most hygienic food packaging company in europe new equipment is being sourced and new jobs created in order to meet the increasing sirane order book
3026736 more than 35 per cent of sirane current sales are now based on products that we werent making twelve months ago turnkey sales of our complete packaging production lines are now taking off particularly in france and in recent months we have made significant growth in our sales margins
3026737 we are very well hedged in terms of choice of suppliers and currencies and in the next few weeks are about to announce several key and new appointments in both production management and in sales for our healthcare and medical lines

3026744 we were confident but our group is in new territory trying to break new ground we know some of the groups we competed against theyre friends of ours people we admire among them were even some of the university teachers who taught us jazz
3026745 each week we went into the studio with a new composition it really forced us to work one night a week i would find a melody and we would improvise on it
3026746 all in our twenties were instrumentalists of different backgrounds our natures and temperaments fuse themselves effectively in our jazz its the glue that holds the group together
3026747 an individual piece could take off in several directions it could start with an armenian wind instrument whose sounds awake the heart to the memory of a crying child only to become attached to a jazz fusion groove of african rhythm while the piano and the clarinet add their joyous swing to the mix which unifies as a creation of something new
3026748 thats all we did listen to music on our way to the school each day i remember a particularly atrocious rush hour bottleneck with heavy snow and everything that comes with it all we had were some old cassettes of greek folk music that had been forgotten and left for dead in the glove compartment we started tripping on them but who knew look at us today were open to all sorts of musical influences

3026750 the office of the press secretary to the president mrs ellen johnson sirleaf is appalled by utterances emerging from the truth amp reconciliation thematic hearings attributed to one jesus alieu swaray over the purported role played by the president during the countrys civil crisis
3026751 mr swarays statement that he reportedly saw president sirleaf dressed in military uniform in npfl areas has absolutely no basis in fact and truth
3026752 mr swarays utterances contain a mixture of historical facts and fallacies imagination and conjectures of rumors which he publicly alluded to
3026753 the office of the press secretary to the president categorically recalls that the president is on record to have said previously then and now that she has never worn any form of military uniform in her lifetime neither participated in the inspection of npfl military bases during the countrys civil conflict
3026754 president sirleafs more than 40 years of remarkable public service are an open testimony and can be referenced and checked against timelines

3026761 its ironical that kashmiris who dont even consider themselves to be indians are getting all the blessings of the government while the people of jammu are always treated as second class citizens
3026762 conspiracy to reduce the majority community in jammu and kashmir into a minority
3026763 my name is yon yonson i live in wisconsin i work in a lumber mill there the people i meet when i walk down the street they ask me my name and i say my name is yon yonson i live in wisconsin
3026764 today rims are a 3 1 billion industry that stands at the revolving heart of two american obsessions automobiles and finding ever more expensive ways to buy things you already have and dont need
3026765 para nadie es un secreto que esa contaminaci n existe aunque la contaminaci n no es total
3026766 nobody can walk down the street and be safe that is be free from police interference
3026767 our document management system is a big time saver for kcdc employees and legal professionals who regularly access court records
3026768 before people had to travel to the courthouse where the records were stored or the court had to mail files from one location to another in addition to the time and costs associated with searching for and copying records occasionally the wrong documents were placed in files now access is immediate and easy making the process more efficient and productive for all
3026769 with our new esuperform solution some of our police agencies now report probable cause statements to the booking facility using their laptops or a kiosk in the jail and the prosecutor transmits them electronically to the emc information infrastructure
3026770 weve automated the process to the extent that human hands seldom have to touch paper documents and the documents themselves have never existed in paper the cost savings are huge because countless hours and reams of paper have been cut from the process
3026771 with legal records under our jurisdiction we must pay close attention to court and state laws mandating document retention
3026772 unlike the king county superior court which is required to keep some court records forever we have finite document retention periods by using emc centeras intelligent software were able to automatically delete certain documents when they reach end of life this has made managing document retention and deletion cycles much simpler and more reliable and ensures were compliant with regulations
3026773 weve seen a lot of social networking proposals a development which is reflective of this industrys current direction

3026775 up until now in studies such as those being done genome wide we have concentrated on finding common variants for common diseases
3026776 we have not been able to study the involvement of rare variants in common diseases because we did not have the statistical tools or the data
3026777 this is the first paper that specifically addresses the analysis of rare variants for common diseases
3026778 although they are individually rare these rare variants that cause common disease are numerous and may have a stronger genetic effect than common variants
3026779 they will be more important in predicting risk of disease than common variants and may be important in drug development
3026780 if a person has specific rare variants we are better able to predict risk
3026781 i dont think weve bottomed out yet in the housing sector
3026782 im concerned that even not subprime but more regular mortgages are beginning to suffer because of the inability to take care of the increase in food prices and gasoline prices
3026783 i dont think housing prices will go back to where they were before this began
3026784 i think they may come back a bit but nothing like what they were
3026785 it wont be one thing itll be a whole series of things
3026786 id rather be a moment or two too late than too soon
3026787 one of the beauties of aig was that diversification was an advantage
3026788 the property casualty business runs in cycles of course you have a big life operation a big international operation in 130 countries and so there was that balance

3026837 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3026838 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia

3026871 i think that will give opportunities for industry to be in the campus and for students to be in the industry as well

3026886 focusing on one possible distraction could very well create a false sense of security
3026887 it would be most effective to look at all the possible problems that can arise in situations that drivers could be confronted with and deal with them comprehensively
3026888 that i think is what pushed us over to decide that its not a question of hands free or hand held
3026889 its just a question of talking on a cell phone
3026890 to take into account the studies that conclude that it is a distraction and to ignore those that would conclude the contrary doesnt do the whole debate justice
3026891 to look at one potential behavior and highlight it and ignore dozens of others that are extremely common is not dealing with this situation as effectively as it could be

3026916 it is the first time in my memory that judge drago has weighed in on a sentencing policy
3026917 the judge made it clear that she is fed up with the violence and the guns and is trying to send a message that if you play with guns you are going to get whacked the new policy might elevate itself to an extent that people will say why bother taking the offer go to trial and have the appellate division review it

3026925 if you now find yourself with a debt on your card and you want to cut down your monthly repayments the best option is a balance transfer
3026926 the majority of the cards on the market come with a 0 balance transfer deal for a period of between three and 15 months alternatively if you dont want to keep switching cards and cant pay off the debt during the term of the introductory deal a life of balance card may be more suitable
3026927 there are a couple of things to bear in mind when selecting a balance transfer card though unless you live in northern ireland you will have to pay a balance transfer fee on 0 cards this can be up to 3 of the amount of debt you transfer
3026928 it is becoming increasingly apparent that we need a sea change in the way that many parents and their children fund university for those approaching higher education in the next few years the government has a clear student finance package in place but for parents of younger children one way to stave off the financial nightmares of the current university generation could be to start saving now

3026953 what happened to me and my family and my close relations resulted from efforts to get rid of me from politics
3026954 these are my political enemies they dont care about the rule of law facts or internationally recognised due process
3026955 in deze fase onderzoeken wij in de eerste plaats de mogelijkheid om georgi politiek en humanitair te helpen
3026956 in zulke ernstige dossiers mag men zich niet overhaasten want er kunnen grote fouten worden begaan waarvoor men daarop lang moet betalen
3026957 inzet voor moskou niet in zuid osseti of abchazi ligt maar in georgi een onafhankelijke soevereine staat ten zuiden van zijn grenzen
3026958 zonder twijfel jammer genoeg burgers het slachtoffer zijn geworden van geschut tussen ons leger en de opstandelingen wij kennen hun precies aantal niet
3026959 natuurlijk ben ik tevreden met mijn belgisch record maar toch vloek ik
3026960 vooraf had ik gezegd dat ik eerst een belgisch record wilde en dat ik dan wel zou zien waar ik daarmee uitkwam maar zes honderdsten van de halve finales is echt niet veel
3026961 net na de finish dacht ik wel had ik maar aan het keerpunt dit of had ik maar dat maar ik heb een goede race gezwommen en kan mezelf niets verwijten er is enorm hard gezwommen ook al omdat de reeksen s avonds geprogrammeerd staan ik heb meteen al mijn volgend doel gesteld en dat is de finale over vier jaar op de spelen in londen
3026962 nu ga ik genieten ik blijf nog in peking tot het einde maar ik lig op de kamer met tom vangeneugden die zijn wedstrijd nog moet zwemmen dus ik ga eerst nog een beetje solidair blijven met hem
3026963 dit soort uitspraken helpt ons niet veel vooruit ik denk dat er wel voor 2009 dingen kunnen gerealiseerd worden
3026964 een staatshervorming is mogelijk maar wie gelooft dat die er kan komen voor de regionale verkiezingen van juni 2009 kent niets van politiek
3026965 een bemiddelaar moet vooral bemiddelen dit soort uitspraken helpt ons niet veel vooruit ik denk dat er wel voor 2009 dingen kunnen gerealiseerd worden laat ons kijken in september waar we staan
3026966 als een schot dat over de hele wereld te horen was
3026967 we hebben er bij het personeel op aangedrongen dat het zou meewerken aan een eventuele overname door het werk voort te zetten
3026968 alles zal uiteraard afhangen van de toestemming van de curator voor het voortzetten van de activiteiten en dat hangt van het orderboekje af
3026969 het gaat om een aanmaning waardoor de braziliaanse bond rafinha niet meer kan selecteren voor het olympisch voetbaltoernooi
3026970 we hadden deze affaire graag zonder klacht opgelost maar de houding van de cbf geeft ons geen andere keuze
3026971 it looked like a game out there the way he just pumped it and threw it right in the hole before the safety could get over there that was a heck of a throw a heck of a throw
3026972 he pumped and threw a 60 yard bomb on a rope between two defenders
3026973 thats something a lot of quarterbacks cant do in this league not just anybody else that was on this team before a lot of quarterbacks in this league cant do that
3026974 he gave me the opportunity to make a play and he put it out there far enough he put enough air up under it where i could run and go get it
3026975 he kind of held the safety up so the safety wouldnt get over there and zipped it in there
3026976 some of these employees live as far away as paris arkansas howe oklahoma and sallisaw oklahoma
3026977 what weve found is that many of these vehicles being taken home by employees are not being called to work after hours
3026978 some are detectives others are support personnel also a lot of supervisory personnel

3026994 you have to always listen to know whats working and whats not research is critical to that process but you have to start from a place of really knowing who you are and what you stand for if thats not the case all the outside help in the world wont solve the problem
3026995 to give anything less than your best is to waste the gift
3026996 one of the most often documented facts is that married people are healthier than non married people but the difference between married and unmarried people has changed over the past few decades
3026997 in general marriage tends to make people healthier happier and richer and thats especially true for men
3026998 an important potential reason is that never married men have greater access to social support now than they did in the past it used to be that having a spouse was important for social support and a social network
3026999 if you get married and then divorced that will hurt your health
3027000 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3027001 its a pity that some of our partners instead of helping are in fact trying to get in the way
3027002 i mean among other things the united states airlifting georgias military contingent from iraq effectively into the conflict zone
3027003 a large part of efforts to force georgian authorities to peace in south ossetia
3027004 thats why we not only have to denounce this but we have to work to stop the fight
3027005 the georgians say it is their land where is our land then
3027006 the education over there until the undergrad level is pretty good
3027007 but when it comes to grad school it just falls off the cliff in terms of quality
3027008 why should punjab get him we want to offer him even more
3027009 when someone gets some notoriety as sabeer did after selling hotmail they get bombarded with offers
3027010 if someone like sabeer is attached to a project then the thinking is other people will want to invest
3027011 but my reason for doing this is to leave behind a legacy
3027012 how many times in our lives do we get a chance to build a city
3027013 how many times do we get an opportunity to fix some of the problems that affect 1 1 billion people thats one sixth of humanity
3027014 the right partners do proper design provide basic things that you and i take for granted here
3027015 a lot of these rich entrepreneurs come to us thinking they have all the answers
3027016 a lot of these ideas have been tried before but not all together in one place
3027017 even my great grandfather was born here how can i sell this land
3027018 the state leaves it to the businessperson to negotiate his way through the thicket of corruption and lack of information that typically surrounds land records in rural areas
3027019 a piece of agricultural land will often have multiple claimants indebtedness and prior claims over the generations
3027020 every subsequent acre of land we were buying was more expensive than the previous one
3027021 we think that over 95 percent of all the farmers actually want to sell
3027022 we think this will put pressure on that remaining 5 percent of people who are maybe greedy for more money
3027023 we are ready to walk away you cant build a city around a farm
3027024 its sabeer climbing mount everest with the city of san francisco on his back

3027028 todays announcement is a testament to our success to date and offers huge promise for the future
3027029 for now its being used for the physical delivery but its failing to attract the liquidity from speculators
3027030 not only offers strong potential from an investment perspective but also constitutes a strategic partnership that will develop our footprint in the middle east
3027031 ive expressed my grave concern about the disproportionate response of russia and that we strongly condemn the bombing outside of south ossetia
3027032 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3027033 the vice president expressed the united states solidarity with the georgian people and their democratically elected government in the face of this threat to georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3027034 people have gotten on my lane line and sucked off of me so i figured this is the one opportunity in my whole career to do that
3027035 jason finished that race better than we could even ask for i was fired up going into that last 50 i was like aw this is going to be a close race jasons last 10 or 15 meters were incredible
3027036 i lost my voice and i was definitely pretty emotional out there
3027037 i knew i was going to have to swim out of my mind
3027038 i dont know how i was able to take it back that fast because ive never been able to come anywhere near that for the last 50
3027039 alain is wounded when you are the last swimmer in a relay and that you have the opportunity to bring a title of this importance to your country you dont get out of this unhurt
3027040 but i dont think that alain lost the race its lezak who won it
3027041 i knew i had to accelerate but it got harder
3027042 i saw katie and thought lets just try to catch her
3027043 but i got a bronze yesterday and a silver this morning if i keep climbing at this pace ill be happy
3027044 ive just had a really off year on a really important year
3027045 i just feel like thats not the last youre going to see of me im going to bring it back and i wont be done until i at least have a legitimate shot at those world records again
3027046 providing a publicly funded college education to illegal aliens will result in lower wages and fewer jobs for american college graduates in the long term enrolling illegal aliens will debase the value of a community college degree thus undermining the primary mission of the community college system itself
3027047 given that some community colleges not to mention the unc system have waiting lists for certain courses and programs it is very likely that illegal aliens are taking spots from american citizens if the current policy of barring illegal immigrant admissions is reversed it will only be a matter of time before the ncccs faces a legal challenge
3027048 the current ban on illegal alien admissions is supported by a clear majority of voters this policy is also consistent with the plain meaning of federal immigration law and will benefit north carolinas working families
3027049 when you think of soul music you think of isaac hayes the expression the sound and the creativity that goes along with it
3027050 even in his later years he never hesitated to appear for a cause or endorse something that he felt was for the good of mankind he will be sorely missed
3027051 he alan panettiere is in custody for spousal assault she lesley panettiere called the sheriffs station and the responding deputy called the paramedics she refused medical treatment and was hit more than once on the cheek while they were arguing
3027052 alan was upset because he felt disrespected at a party they argued he hit her multiple times he left i dont know if hayden was there or who else was in the house
3027053 the greatest battles of life are fought out every day in the silent chambers of ones own soul
3027054 kaminsky said at this weeks black hat briefings in las vegas that the flaw not only allows hackers to force people to visit web sites they didnt want to but it also permits them to intercept e mail messages
3027055 although the email aspect of the flaw implies a man in the middle attack the flaw goes much deeper than that since it involves the central computers that route internet users to relevant ip addressed systems
3027056 the problem with the internet is that although its structure appears logical and relatively simple the reality is that there is some quite complex routing involved and as the internet grows so that complexity

3027069 it will become impractical to constrain atmospheric carbon dioxide the greenhouse gas produced in burning fossil fuels to a level that prevents the climate system from passing tipping points that lead to disastrous climate changes that spiral dynamically out of humanitys control

3027077 is is a shame that some of our partners instead of helping us are standing in our way the scale of this cynicism is mind boggling an attempt to call the white black and the black white and skillfully present the aggression victims as aggressors and to assign all responsibility for the aggression to the victims russia of course would take its peace mission to a logical conclusion we will make efforts to build effective relations with all participants in this conflict including georgia
3027078 that we hope demonstrates that we can work together to solve the issues of homelessness in the context of community care in its fullest sense

3027081 the neighborhood has never opposed housing the homeless we just need security and measures put in place to reassure that our neighborhood will continue to maintain a harmonious co existence with the spencer house

3027084 a man came to valet the car at 9am on sunday morning and it wasnt until then i noticed they were missing
3027085 my sons van and a car were parked on the drive and the garden is surrounded by a fence and gate although the gate wasnt shut i have a stone drive so i would have heard them walk across it
3027086 i went driving up the road to have a look in case they dumped them but there was nothing there at all
3027087 im so angry next time im going to cement them down
3027088 it seems that nowadays you cant leave anything lying around especially out in the open without it being at risk of being stolen garden ornaments unfortunately are no exception
3027089 high fences and walls around the back garden of your property have to be the ultimate solution
3027090 it is also a good idea to site them within view of your house and remember to use lighting with a movement sensor
3027091 this will make any attempt to steal a far riskier business for the offender and reduce the chance of this kind of thing happening

3027097 on tuesday july 15 this year thames valley police officers were driving along norfolk road the defendant was sat outside the spread eagle pub
3027098 they stopped their vehicle and followed him they found a small wrap of green herbal matter
3027099 it fell out the bottom of the defendants trousers and on to the floor
3027100 an officer picked up the cling film and believed the substance inside was herbal cannabis
3027101 the defendant said it was for his own personal use
3027102 thankfully his use of class a drugs appears to have ceased but he is still using cannabis
3027103 i can see no reason why he cannot carry on his unpaid work or do more unpaid work if necessary

3027122 asuma sus competencias que ejerza sus responsabilidades y que presente a los grupos pol ticos y a los agentes econ micos y sociales un paquete de medidas para hacer frente a la crisis actual
3027123 no obstante el tiempo pone a cada uno en su lugar y con el paso de los a os el presidente del gobierno jos luis rodr guez zapatero ser recordado como el gran hacedor de una de las peores coyunturas econ micas de la historia reciente de la econom a patria
3027124 pese a que el epicentro de la crisis se situaba hace un a o en ee uu su virulento avance e instalaci n en nuestro pa s es todo un hecho y no s lo eso sino que es una consecuencia directa del inmovilismo que el gobierno de jos luis rodr guez zapatero ha mantenido
3027125 esta es sin duda la peor crisis en d cadas la crisis que zapatero no ha visto y que en un a o escaso ha devorado 155 000 millones de euros a lo largo del territorio espa ol y el ejecutivo de zapatero es dadas las circunstancias el peor enemigo que podr amos tener para afrontarla por su desidia por su desconocimiento en materia econ mica y por su poco respeto a la verdad
3027126 valencianos y espa oles necesitan respuestas ante la que est cayendo merecen una clase pol tica que los ampare y vele por sus intereses pero sobre todo lo que verdaderamente no toleran ni deben tolerar es asistir d a tras d a al mismo discurso vac o de soluciones y plagado de lugares comunes
3027127 cuando las reformas estructurales brillan por su ausencia y el super vit del estado se esfuma en tan s lo tres meses es normal que se disparen todas las voces de alarma y los ciudadanos exijan responsabilidades
3027128 es muy importante que el pp explique lo que est pasando porque aqu se nos dice que al gobierno no le van a apoyar los presupuestos pero gente de su propio partido y los grupos que apoyan al gobierno dicen una cosa y la contraria asever y la gente tiene derecho a saber qu va a pasar con el dinero de los contribuyentes

3027140 the size and discount of that type of deal isnt the norm yet
3027141 the critical mass of bulk reo is in well capitalized institutions that dont need to sell yet in bulk at a deep discount because they are better off not taking substantial hits to the capital just to get the assets off their books
3027142 this type of bulk buy would make an impact on the market they are in a unique position because they have a long time horizon to invest and a cheap cost of capital its actually a perfect time for them to acquire these reo assets

3027147 automotive manufacturers cannot afford to ignore the growing importance of multicultural markets including paying close attention to their loyalty
3027148 many manufacturers are already increasing their focus on marketing and connecting with these markets through non traditional avenues like scholarships and supporting community activities
3027149 its important for oems and their supporting agencies to measure the performance of these programs against their marketing goals

3027160 there have been scottish labour politicians at local government level and at westminster who have been resentful and even contemptuous of the scottish parliament that behaviour needs to stop

3027177 it was painful to hear some of the things that came out of the report that looked at the way we handle our strategic forces
3027178 one of those things was the air forces focus on the mission has drifted which led to a serious decline in performance these things were painful to hear because i believe were much better than that
3027179 thank you great creator for all you have given us and allowed us to come together as one today
3027180 the fiesta is a great opportunity for people to support the restoration of the mission and california history
3027181 this day is about people enjoying the blend of cultures and celebrating what a blessing it is to be here in this beautiful place
3027182 i have been volunteering at the fiesta for 14 years and this is a good cause to help the mission restoration
3027183 i have volunteered for two years and i like seeing the way people interact with each other when they come to the fiesta
3027184 we are having so much fun this is such a great day to enjoy solvang
3027185 the mission does so much for our community and its nice that people are giving back to them the fiesta is also an homage to our heritage and the history of our area
3027186 working with the same people every year is wonderful and getting a chance to tell visitors how great our little valley is is my favorite part of fiesta
3027187 whats more challenging is our reduced budgets just to be frank with you were operating in a time of fairly dramatic budget cuts so how you manage the mission and take care of the people in a time of major budget cuts may be my biggest challenge
3027188 the air force is really great about taking care of its people
3027189 for my money if you dont take care of your people then the mission will suffer because you have to have people energized and with a good attitude so thats the balancing act
3027190 do you cut the mission do you cut the quality of life how do you reach a balance between those two things when youre facing these budget cuts
3027191 and when you have to replace a weather sensor thats out in the middle of a field contractors are going to say youre going to need to mow that before we go out there a real world situation by the way because a we cant get out there b we cant see it and c theres probably a ton of snakes in that field
3027192 vandenberg wont be quite as beautiful as you usually see it but it will still always be a pretty base
3027193 every time i go over to the pacific coast club i look at the wall of previous commanders that have been here and it gets me right here
3027194 because this is where it all began all the initial test and evaluation of icbms as vandenberg air force base turns 50 years old suddenly i find myself kind of as the mayor of this base it cant get much better than that from my perspective so im really blessed
3027195 its going to affect our lifestyle we moved out here for the quiet and the solitude we wanted this lifestyle
3027196 we will make whatever changes we can to accommodate the community im here to listen
3027197 its akin to living next to the railroad tracks in the flight path or next to the bus stop
3027198 who is going to buy the house next to the bus stop this is going to limit our ability to sell i will never be able to sell it
3027199 its in an ecologically sensitive area and too remote of a spot
3027200 its definitely going to have nothing but impacts the livelihood out here is at risk im not going to live here for 40 years with that
3027201 the negative declaration while its not an eir has substantially more conditions that are much tighter than what the eir used
3027202 weve had to swerve when a big truck is coming because theres not enough room for it to turn
3027203 theres a lot of times weve almost gone off the edge
3027204 the project has no positive outlook except for the county and excelaron

3027217 the evidence of this affair was right in front of the good old boys of main stream media but they looked the other way
3027218 just one year ago the company spent millions of dollars expanding into different markets and now they decided it was a mistake and shut down the expansion efforts
3027219 the irony of those decisions is that the very managers that made those decisions were not laid off but the talent that led the companys successes locally were all let go
3027220 journalism is definitely changing where everyone is now a reporter and it is certainly revealing that a tabloid like the national enquirer breaks a major story with such implications as this one

3027246 if it was just me it wouldnt really be worth all of this
3027247 i had said this before that we do not have any hostility against the israeli people and i still say the same thing proudly
3027248 not all the israeli people are wearing military boots on the street
3027249 the batsmen did not put up a good show here and that probably cost us the series it was critical that the middle order got runs and there was not enough consistency from any of the batters and that probably what cost us the game and the test match here
3027250 having won the toss it was important to get a big score we got a good start but could not capitalise for a new batsman to go straightway and face two spinners it is never easy if they had converted the early starts it would have been a different story overall we did not play quality cricket to win the series
3027251 bowlers put their hearts out ishant showed brilliant performance throughout the series zaheer showed lot of character harbhajan was fantastic to come back from all that he had been through during the last couple of months
3027252 i have always considered a 100 is a 100 no matter how you get it and this one was a tough one it is one among the best and i am happy to get that
3027253 it was the leadership coming from the young players like mendis and prasad which helped us to win the match both of bowlers made themselves counted and contributed at regular intervals
3027254 it was a case of putting pressure on the indians by scoring as many runs as possible
3027255 the young players have taken a lot of responsibility they have helped to take down pressure from the seniors and the seniors players also pushed themselves hard and contributed to the win
3027256 the guys showed tremendous character after the 2nd test debacle we spoke about the areas to improve and each one took responsibilities
3027257 both the spinners mendis and muralitharan bowled in tandem and helped to keep indias total under control
3027258 although the lankan spin twin made the indians dance to their music it was debutant pacer dimmika prasad who set the stage by ripping through the indian top order in both the innings

3027265 the phone was a disappointment from the standpoint that it couldnt maintain a consistent connection with the 3g network all the other features were fantastic
3027266 frankly if i knew it was going to be like this i wouldnt have paid the extra 10 a month
3027267 what were seeing is that the iphone 3g is performing very well
3027268 im not denying that people are having problems but we have to deal with these on a case by case basis
3027269 my belief is that because at amp ts network is not built out to every cell site people are getting frustrated because theyre finding places where the 3g signal isnt available or is weak
3027270 that doesnt mean you cant get a good experience on 1900mhz
3027271 typically the more you pack into a phone the tougher it is to build a really good one
3027272 sometimes customers may want to pin a problem on the device
3027273 or they want to pin it on the operator but really it doesnt matter how well they work separately they need to work together
3027274 i think the biggest disappointment was the service of both at amp t and apple i expected a lot more from both organizations
3027275 they should admit that there is an issue and that they are working through it
3027276 they had quite a bit there 25 000 square feet of cabinets and inventory and equipment
3027277 this is absolutely routine the way its set up is the city did estimates of the value of the fixtures and the inventory and they compare that to the moving expense and they give the business owner the lesser figure
3027278 you have to understand that i went kicking and screaming

3027320 you cant think about an energy economy or a global energy system only when the sun is out
3027321 you could imagine during the day you have a photovoltaic cell you take some of that electricity and use it in your house then take the other part of that electricity for my catalyst feed the catalyst water and you get hydrogen and oxygen
3027322 so ive made your house a gas station and a power station its all enabled because we can use light plus water to make a chemical fuel which is hydrogen and oxygen
3027323 in the next 50 years the world needs 16 terawatts by the end of the century well need around 30
3027324 theres a heck of lot of energy stored in chemical bonds
3027325 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem

3027349 however acas management have dragged their feet and not even started negotiating yet the prospect of a repeat of last years delay combined with the likelihood of a below inflation pay award has left staff feeling angry and betrayed

3027351 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3027352 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3027353 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3027354 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3027355 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3027359 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3027360 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3027361 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3027364 whether it is coal hydro electric or nuclear power santee cooper should be applauded for its strong commitment to ensuring south carolinians have an abundant source of clean energy
3027365 the only way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and lower prices at the pump is for america to rapidly pursue our own energy sources
3027366 america should remove barriers to a wide array of new energy supplies including hydrogen wind solar geothermal hydroelectric clean coal and even technologies we havent yet discovered but the first step to lower energy prices is to allow the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale to expire on october 1st this date also known as american energy freedom day is vitally important to our nations future energy security

3027374 what makes you think youve got a chance god wont do anything to help you you are dead meat

3027380 dont say the old lady screamed bring her on and let her scream
3027381 arent as troubled as some of us older folks are by reading that doesnt go in a line
3027382 no ones ever said you should read more books to get into college
3027383 what we are losing in this country and presumably around the world is the sustained focused linear attention developed by reading
3027384 i would believe people who tell me that the internet develops reading if i did not see such a universal decline in reading ability and reading comprehension on virtually all tests
3027385 reading a book and taking the time to ruminate and make inferences and engage the imaginational processing is more cognitively enriching without doubt than the short little bits that you might get if youre into the 30 second digital mode
3027386 it takes a long time to read a 400 page book
3027387 cover a lot more of the topic from different points of view
3027388 on the internet you can hear from a bunch of people
3027389 they may not be pedigreed academics they may be someone in their shed with a conspiracy theory but you would weigh that
3027390 kids are using sound and images so they have a world of ideas to put together that arent necessarily language oriented
3027391 they go through a lot of details that arent really needed
3027392 online just gives you what you need nothing more or less
3027393 i think its just more comfortable and i hate to say easier but it more meets the needs of somebody who might not be a fluent reader
3027394 i was trying to imagine this and i was like i cant do this
3027395 ranging from names birth dates and social security numbers to medical diagnoses and treatments
3027396 a low level harris county hospital district administrator probably violated federal law when she downloaded medical and financial records for 1 200 patients with hiv aids and other medical conditions onto a flash drive that later was lost or stolen
3027397 it was just a major screw up by an employee
3027398 i think everybodys hope is that the flash drive fell in a trash can and is in a landfill somewhere now

3027419 none of the players have really played an appreciable amount of times that unless something dramatic happens right away some guy for five or six days is oh holy smoke this is really different
3027420 its the best thing for the team to provide ourselves the opportunity to get as much input as we can that is not to make an inappropriately quick decision
3027421 it might take some games to find out who the one quarterback is or who the two are that we should plan on playing
3027422 it might take a few games to find that out
3027423 i havent played an official game but ive been tackled been hit put it through all the tests
3027424 i trust my rehab its kind of a story of the past
3027425 physically hes the same kevin ogletree that he was maybe a little bit better
3027426 hes got more muscles to him more strength to him now its just making the progress with his game that it was not possible for him to do during that time frame
3027427 in maine we have a law that if doctors teachers or commercial film developers observe any form of child abuse or pornography they have to report that to law enforcement if we require all these other professionals to report something that is absolutely against the law the people who possibly come across this more than others should have to report it
3027428 we are human we make mistakes but at this point this far in the season we cant keep making mistakes like that we gave the game away really
3027429 this was an important game its against a rival and its a league game there are no excuses looking past this one
3027430 one of the best free kicks i have seen in a game in this league
3027431 it was a bit of a scramble all the way across the goal but i still have got to get it
3027432 we let our foot off the gas and we started to give them a little life
3027433 two soft goals really cost us giving away a free kick right outside the box and then the second one was just a cluster of errors its hard to come back from that i think we put our heads down
3027434 someone yelled for me to play it back so i thought maybe ngel stopped
3027435 i probably should have tried to flick it the other way
3027436 we know we have to play tuesday in a big game but i dont think we came out with the attitude that we were just going to throw this game away
3027437 we came out well but couldnt keep it up once they got that first goal they just got rolling from there
3027438 i was starting to swing the bat a little better the team is playing good
3027439 it was just a big disappointment for something like this to happen
3027440 felt good some at bats a little tardy on other ones
3027441 hopefully its going to be best for him because he was having a problem with range of motion of his shoulder
3027442 hes playing and not really being himself as far as swinging the bat maybe this will give him a chance to get some more range of motion and maybe get the old scotty back here

3027448 we evaluated all of the factors and looked at the various options before deciding to go with kodak trendsetter news platesetters they will work well with how our production is organized
3027449 we are honored that dow jones amp company showed this level of confidence in kodak thermal ctp technology they conducted a very thorough review process before making this significant investment in prepress equipment
3027450 printers like dow jones are attracted to kodak trendsetter news platesetters because they offer stability and high quality digital production across multiple plant locations they can assure their customers of color consistency from each print site removing a major variable from the process

3027453 they came and the great thing was that they stayed and huddled under their tents and gazebos

3027457 usually im a lot taller than my opponents so when i put a knee up it usually lands to the chest or the stomach andre gusmao is one of the taller opponents who i fought and i may have caught him a little low which was totally accidental but it feels great to win in the ufc i thought about this many many nights dreaming about it eating right and training hard i accomplished my first goal a big one anyway

3027469 it was a dream come true signing a professional contract
3027470 i went from a team in college where we didnt win too many games to providence where we didnt lose too many games so it was great
3027471 im really happy i got to go there at the end of the year
3027472 i felt it was the right time for me and my career to take the next step
3027473 but leaving school and the boys behind was pretty tough
3027474 i just want to come into camp in the best shape i can work as hard as i can and give myself a chance to get called up some time during the year
3027475 i also have a shamrock on my back just because im half irish

3027477 es dif cil imaginar que los habitantes de osetia del sur quieran seguir siendo parte de georgia tras la fechor a cometida por el r gimen de saakashvili
3027478 es sabido que las autoridades georgianas obstaculizan la salida de tbilisi a los ciudadanos rusos deseosos de abandonarlo
3027479 it was a very hard fought series that drained a lot out of us
3027480 we showed a lot of character especially to come back after the galle test
3027481 i am very happy with the players because they played really good cricket throughout the series
3027482 we kept the standards high kept pushing ourselves and we never gave up
3027483 credit should go to the whole team i thought the difference was that we had a lot of contributions from different players throughout the series
3027484 whenever we were in a situation that we needed somebody to put their hand up do something for us they did it thats probably the most pleasing thing for me
3027485 ho formulato a prandelli e alla squadra ha detto ancora il sindaco gli auguri alla vigilia di un importante appuntamento che pu segnare il destino della squadra e della societ in questa stagione ho trovato la squadra fortemente motivata e spero proprio che domani sera la fiorentina possa centrare un risultato che le consenta poi di affrontare il palcoscenico europeo
3027486 la m s pesimista y opositora de las creencias sobre inflaci n anual que hay circulando
3027487 estamos dispuestos a hacer una propuesta para mejorar el importante aumento que dimos en marzo pero el veinte por ciento es una locura as llegar a al cincuenta por ciento anual ni lo pensamos
3027488 tampoco por salir de una coyuntura vamos a estar discutiendo en noviembre que nos faltan fondos para pagar los sueldos
3027489 la de daniel scioli es una gesti n muy seria de gobierno

3027495 we are very pleased that johns leadership at nav canada and his overall contributions to the aviation industry are being recognized by the premier international association for air traffic control
3027496 this prestigious award suitably honours one of the most innovative leaders in the field of air transportation
3027497 it has been the consistent dedication to the advancement of the industry that has earned john crichton the prestigious glen a gilbert award
3027498 i am grateful for this award but it really belongs to the entire nav canada team
3027499 it is only through the skill dedication and achievements of nav canada employees that we have become one of the safest most efficient and most modern air navigation systems in the world
3027500 remarkable contributions to the air transportation industry over a long and successful career
3027501 you man i have to market the book too not just write it
3027502 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified because i know from just what im hearing that theres this incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go no decisions have been made and so we are trying to work all this through with the dnc and with the obama campaign
3027503 democracy isnt something you negotiate it is only fair for her delegates to cast her vote
3027504 what i think well see at the convention is senator clinton and senator obama working together and many of our supporters working together to show real unity to elect obama and to elect democrats up and down the ticket this november
3027505 you might say that women voters hold this election in the palm of their hands
3027506 we contend that lack of unity is the reason senator obama is in a dead heat with a 71 year old republican and no disrespect for senator mccain but age is a factor to many voters he represents the incumbent party which most of the american people are unhappy with why is it that they are tied right now
3027507 vacant heart and hand and eye easy live and quiet die
3027508 i think hell be happy and have a few words of wisdom after sydney
3027509 the main thing for me is not to get too excited about it and to push it to the back of my mind for the moment and if its still standing at the end of the meet then get happy about it
3027510 it was an amazing race and something i wont forget
3027511 its rare that you are happy in coming third but myself and these three guys are amazed at the times that we have swam
3027512 its always nice to play the big names i think especially when you pride yourself on playing well in the big tournaments
3027513 second rounds extremely early to play probably the best player going around at the moment but its a good time to knock him off too
3027514 but you know i can only play the hand thats dealt to me
3027515 it was a long time ago it was four years ago
3027516 theyre probably some of the fondest memories of my entire career winning bronze because of i guess the team aspect god i was playing probably some of the best tennis of my career at that particular time but probably more so i think in the months beyond that
3027517 of course its disappointing because you always go into a match thinking and believing and preparing to win so when you dont its disappointing
3027518 but oh look better than judo youre out there a minute and you can get demolished and walk off someone got demolished in a minute yesterday so i had a good hour maybe
3027519 i dont think i will have a problem after this little scare
3027520 he did a great job to keep the boat straight he was on the rudder from stroke one he didnt call anything he was struggling then it just went
3027521 i thought we were going to but marty pulled it up pretty quick
3027522 i was about to yell out and then it went round and marty called it off
3027523 i knew it had to be something to do with the rudder
3027524 boats dont slide like that especially in the middle of the race unless there is some sort of problem
3027525 he dennis was fairly nervous there for a little while it was touch and go
3027526 was a little concerned that he was going to end up with another bow ball to close to him
3027527 it is effectively like a semi final in semi finals you have to finish in the top three today we have to finish in the top four we want to win the thing otherwise we row in a b final do they have b finals
3027528 for a while in there it was just total chaos
3027529 nerves are part of the way my body gets me ready to race this time though i was nervous to the point where i was almost vomiting
3027530 just before i walked out i thought youre here youve done the work you have the confidence to do a good job
3027531 at that point she explained with a smile and a sigh of relief a
3027532 i was getting into my suit as we were going into marshalling and it wouldnt zip up i had to do a quick change into another suit i got it on in the end but i was probably a little bit stressed out
3027533 after all the drama that was an extraordinary swim by jessicah
3027534 to come here and swim a personal best time in an olympic final is more than i could have hoped for and to walk away with a gold medal well its blown me away anything i do from here is like a bonus
3027535 its a very fast course for an australian it feels a lot like olympic park in sydney i just love racing there
3027536 what did you do to get your players to kill their own super egos
3027537 we have a saying that you play for the name on the front of the guernsey not the back of guernsey all our players play for the front of the guernsey
3027538 they are heroes for some of our players this makes things psychologically difficult
3027539 we are helping acciona with tatanka whose name is inspired by the lakota indian tribal word for the buffalo that once roamed the midwest to charge into the american wind industry with a major project in the best wind farming area of the united states
3027540 the dakotas high wind energy potential and low population means that wind power will be available to transmit to the rest of the midwest
3027541 tatanka represents another major step toward accionas goal of reducing the worlds co 2 emissions by 220 million tons in the next 23 years

3027574 ich denke unsere gr te sorge war dass wir keine religi sen leute beleidigen wollten aber wenn man sich die diskussion anschaut die sich daraus entfaltet hat dann hatten wir eine betr chtliche zahl von spielern die wir vielleicht militante atheisten nennen sollten die restlichen spieler schienen sehr tolerant zu sein inklusive der religi sen personen
3027575 ich habe nicht erwartet auf seiten der atheisten auf widerstand zu sto en ich erwartete es auf der religi sen seite
3027576 aber bis jetzt bekam ich kein kritisches feedback von irgendeiner religi sen person dar ber dass wir religion falsch interpretieren oder schlecht repr sentieren es waren wirklich die atheisten
3027577 wir haben einige mitarbeiter im team die sehr religi s sind und daher haben wir w hrend des designprozesses versucht in unserem team dem kleinen mikrokosmos von spielern da drau en die ffentliche beleidigung von gl ubigen personen zu vermeiden dennoch wollten wir die idee der religion im spiel haben

3027605 numbers wise you look at the depth chart and you kind of say theres no way im making this team
3027606 and i tried to talk to him about that early on telling him dont look at the numbers just go out there and play your game and let what happens happen
3027607 hes had a phenomenal camp hes really working the slot well hes got great speed on the outside and hes a tough guy
3027608 he gets it but hes still young the challenge will be when hes playing earlier in the game against the other teams top people then youll see
3027609 so until he gets on their best nickel defensive back and best corners and has to go against really the top people in the league then well see
3027610 i feel like im working hard and that im competing for a spot
3027611 i dont really look for the recognition as much as long as the people upstairs are taking a look at the film and theyre satisfied with what im doing then im pretty secure out here
3027612 if it doesnt work out here hopefully im consistent enough that someone else is looking at film and gives me another shot
3027613 the only thing i said was when you intercept a ball get up and run with it
3027614 there was like five seconds on the clock so i was like stay down big guy
3027615 just remember we have to get on the plane and get home
3027616 he really helped me out when i was down there
3027617 just seeing the game and recognizing whats in front of you recognizing formations stances and alignments
3027618 thats our style of play it doesnt mean anything if your tempo is high but youre not executing and youre throwing the ball all over the place
3027619 theyre a talented group i thought we missed a couple tackles that we would normally make but i have high expectations for our defensive football team the bar has been set pretty high im pretty picky and they know it so when a player or group doesnt perform to the level i think hes absolutely capable of performing in any game then im going to talk about it or talk to him about it and it was more that than anything but they did some good things

3027716 teachers possess the power to create conditions that can help students learn a great deal or keep them from learning much at all teaching is the intentional act of creating those conditions and good teaching requires that we understand the inner sources of both the intent and the act
3027717 the silence of our students is the same silence we have known in other settings it is the silence of blacks in the presence of whites of women in the presence of men of the powerless in the presence of people with power it is the silence of marginal people people who have been told that their voice has no value people who maintain silence in the presence of the enemy because in silence there is safety student silence is normally not the product of ignorance or indifference or cynicism it is a silence born of fear
3027718 i should have remembered from my own experience that students too are afraid afraid of failing of not understanding of being drawn into issues they would rather avoid of having their ignorance exposed or their prejudices challenged of looking foolish in front of their peers when my students fears mix with mine fear multiplies geometrically and education is paralyzed if we were to turn some of our externalized reformist energies toward exorcising the inner demons of fear we would take a vital step toward the renewal of teaching and learning
3027719 though the academy claims to value multiple modes of knowing it honors only one an objective way of knowing that takes us into the real world by taking us out of ourselves in this culture the self is not a source to be tapped but a danger to be suppressed not a potential to be fulfilled but an obstacle to be overcome
3027720 we can and do make education an exclusively outward enterprise forcing students to memorize and repeat facts without ever appealing to their inner truth and we get predictable results many students never want to read a challenging book or think a creative thought once they get out of school what we teach will never take unless it connects with the inward living core of our students lives with our students inward teachers

3027722 i was very comfortable with my game there here it wasnt the case i wasnt happy with how i was swinging the club this week
3027723 the only thing i knew from experience is that in a major nobody goes without making mistakes
3027724 as long as i hung in there i knew i would get my opportunity
3027725 and the putts there was no question i was just fully focused on holing them
3027726 its nice when youve got to hole a putt that you see the line right away
3027727 it was an easy putt to read it was a double break i hit it a cup right of the hole
3027728 i knew the pace was about right i wanted to see it break i was just saying go on keep going keep going break it broke right left and got just inside the left half and dropped very nice

3027753 once lester coslic starts something he stays with it 100 percent
3027754 hes at it whole hearted and it will get done hes the kind of individual you want if you want the job done
3027755 i learned there it was nice to be an american
3027756 i appreciated what it was like to be an american
3027757 you had to have 21 of your own teeth 20 20 vision be between 5 feet 8 inches and 6 feet 2 inches and the right weight
3027758 that was in 1958 and we were married in 1960
3027759 i had to write a letter to the pennsylvania state police that said i wanted to get married they checked her background
3027760 they averaged three accidents a day on a closed course
3027761 it was nothing to get called out at any and all times
3027762 it was your job you do the best you could you try to get it solved
3027763 and its not like the crime shows that get one case a day and solve it in a half hour sometimes i worked 50 cases at one time
3027764 i didnt miss the paperwork but i missed the guys
3027765 he was a young adult sometimes theyre not good hunters and they get emaciated
3027766 from as low as 10 cent per minute phone calls
3027767 very difficult and a better phase perhaps a better phrase is disappointing for the pennsylvania state police as an organization and in particular troop n hazleton
3027768 if i had one thing to say as a saving grace is that we police our own and we do the right thing as far as the truth be told
3027769 they made me feel like i was a real criminal like i had done this terrible thing
3027770 the good constables which are the majority want those bad apples out
3027771 any time you have people in power youre going to have problems
3027772 their work is very hidden and they deal with individuals within the criminal justice system who dont have much lobby power influence or sympathy
3027773 so they are individuals who can be taken advantage of easily not many people would care
3027774 t ell her she is being good perhaps have the other sitting with you on your lap make sure you both are watching
3027775 t he nice thing with having you there is that i can demonstrate things on you
3027776 silveri asked what he would be allowed to do with the children and if there would be
3027777 like crapping on someone or cutting them or that sort of stuff
3027778 i know hes a cop but did he think he was god hes not invincible
3027779 he was the last person we would think of ever
3027780 ive been in tears all day because i cant believe this
3027781 i never thought he would jeopardize his job and his life for something like this
3027782 i always felt very safe knowing he was up there i wont turn my back on him until i know if hes guilty or not
3027783 but i have a 14 year old daughter and if its true i cant be friends with him
3027784 this is a reflection of an individual and not an agency
3027785 its certainly a sad day for the pennsylvania state police
3027786 but everyone in society must be held accountable in this case sadly it led to a member of the state police
3027787 here in luzerne and lackawanna counties with todays announcement we will have invested 653 million in new state funds since 2003

3027789 establishing this office underscores my commitment to creating a culture of inclusion that values and promotes diversity and equal opportunity throughout state government
3027790 the new office of diversity will make clear to all those who are in positions to hire that they need to be inclusive they need to consider diversity a priority
3027791 this office is being created to ensure diversity is a priority
3027792 its not about affirmative action its about inclusion this is about inclusion
3027793 affirmative action has got a connotation that you are somehow giving people a preference despite their qualifications this office is simply intended to ensure that qualified people of whatever subgroup have got an opportunity for instance there are some jobs that are traditionally male dominated which might now be open to women

3027801 as a whole five teams broke the world record we broke the world record by four seconds and won by nine one hundredths of a second so it was a pretty intense race a pretty fun race and i was glad to be a part of it

3028049 it is too early to estimate how much oil has been discovered in this well bore but we do believe that as a consequence of this discovery there is a relatively high probability that this area could contain enough oil and gas to double revus current reserves and contingent resources

3028051 whats it going to look like once that stimulus runs out
3028052 the profile that we think consumers are going to follow over the remainder of the year is one of lower spending
3028053 the rapid increases in the oil price that we saw earlier in the year are not likely to continue
3028054 the unemployment rate will probably drift upwards but if it doesnt accelerate the fed will probably feel like it can begin safely raising rates
3028055 it would be surprising if the fed did not raise short term interest rates

3028066 the pink harvest has started to take off in kodiak but remains flat in southeast and prince william sound
3028067 we are seeing poor runs of multiple species across broad geographic areas
3028068 that indicates to me it is probably an ocean problem but mixed in with those were a few runs that were pretty good

3028071 burr puzzles are interlocking puzzles known in europe and asia since at least the 18th century traditionally they are made from wood and require special wood so that the pieces do not change shape too much in changing temperature and humidity
3028072 from the late 1980s to the mid 1990 bill cutler and others undertook a complete analysis of all six piece burrs from this analysis we now know that there are roughly 35 65 billion ways to assemble burr puzzles pieces 71 3 billion if mirror images are counted also of these 35 65 billion logical assemblies 5 95 billion can be taken apart
3028073 1986 peter marineau designed this puzzle by hand it was the highest level burr known before bill cutler did his exhaustive computer analysis

3028090 after world war ii the good ideas were loaded up in a small number of large companies

3028103 do you support drilling in the gulf of mexico for oil and natural gas
3028104 should we let oil companies drill offshore in hopes of knocking a few cents off every barrel of oil in ten or twenty years or should we increase energy conservation now to protect the sugar white sands of pensacola beach
3028105 with no mention made of either possible environmental trade offs or of the long time it might take for expanded oil drilling to actually produce more oil

3028112 we should start 2009 by calling a referendum on whether to approve the states new constitution policy

3028117 as far as iraqi rat holes for american taxpayers hard earned funds go this one is pretty small potatoes it appears to be doing some small amount of good probable because administration cronies dont seem to be able to get their oily mitts on most of it
3028118 yes its bribery perhaps but much better than the bribes we give to the rich crooks that money stolen by contractors and the terrible waste of using it for more killing if we can buy our way out of mccains 100 year commitment itll be cheap
3028119 cerp funds are one of the militarys best tools in the current conflict the problem is the current misuse by some not all who have that money availabe when used correctly the cash can be very beneficial in reducing violence and allowing safe access for us troops in dangerous areas
3028120 im tired of hearing how well everything is going in iraq there is one simple measure of success or not in iraq when the two million refugees start coming home in large numbers then that will be success
3028121 iraq has 79 billions in the bank of new york collecting interest they also sitting on top of many large oil fields my tax should be spent here in america
3028122 with 79 billion surplus it is time for the iraqi government to stand up and cease being a bloodsucker on american funds and people this is like paying all the bill for the richest guy in the group while america goes into debt to help iraq the iraqi government is building cash reserves enough of this nonsense
3028123 cerp funds may represent an effective counterinsurgency weapon and it seems fair to compensate iraqis who have suffered under the occupation unfortunately this approach makes the iraqi economy more dependent on american cash and isnt an efficient way to create the infrastructure that is prerequisite to economic development
3028124 the country of iraq that the republicans attacked for oil is costing us more to bomb then rebuild it than what we pay for gas and oil at the pumps here in the us what an absloutly stupid idea this was a quagmire of billions of us tax dollars down the drain
3028125 why should the u s military bribe iraqis and just imagine what 2 8 billion of u s taxpayer money can do to repair and maintain americas infrastructure of roads and bridges as soon as possible this commanders emergency response fund should be shut down immediately

3028127 together these three papers represent a landmark week in schizophrenia genetics
3028128 this is an important step in helping to unravel the challenging biology of schizophrenia
3028129 the human dna blueprint consists of three billion letters of code most of which are the same between individuals but about 10 million of which can take at least two forms
3028130 these single nucleotide snp variations are scattered throughout the entire code and particular forms of the letters may either increase risk for a particular disease or be used as a signpost for nearby variations which cause disease
3028131 we were able to show in a very large sample that a snp within the znf804a gene on chromosome 2 was associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia
3028132 this finding strongly supports a role for the znf804a gene in schizophrenia however the associated snp within this gene is probably just a signpost for one or more disease causing mutations located nearby
3028133 it is crucial that we identify these mutations and work out how they contribute to the symptoms of schizophrenia
3028134 what we have is a clue to help unravel the genetic basis of this disease while not forgetting that environmental factors are also involved
3028135 so many uses that are very good for the community
3028136 this decline is not surprising given the state of the economy
3028137 however the b to b event business remains relatively strong up 2 4 and both custom publishing and digital continue to grow at 20 so as we look at the industry holistically although its a tough year b to b is resilient

3028144 we saw him leave but in the olympics it could be anything it could be to talk to reporters it could be a problem with tickets and logistics of practices we didnt know
3028145 so it wasnt until after we got our therapy when we had our meetings and we saw a lot of people show up that we knew something was wrong we havent seen him since he left the room
3028146 hes the guy whos been steering leading our squad through these last four years
3028147 i know the guys it meant an awful lot to us when we heard from him he talked about trying to move on each of us has to try to move on in our own way
3028148 our knee jerk reactions were like any other human beings we were angry we were upset
3028149 we wanted to talk to our friends and family who are here and back home we met as a team as a male sport we tend to hide our feelings a lot but there was definitely a moment where guys let off how they felt about the situation how they felt about hugh not being on the bench
3028150 as soon as the rubber meets the road he has to make a decision
3028151 id much rather be sitting on the bench telling him what i think he should be doing and having him saying i dont think so rather than where i am right now
3028152 we wanted to do something with our jerseys but we didnt have time so we put wizs moms initials and dads initials on the back of our shoes and just talked about huddling up together taking a couple of moments to let him know that were thinking about him
3028153 its been very emotional for us the last 24 hours obviously
3028154 were playing a volleyball game out there nothing in comparison to the loss that happened to our team usa volleyball our whole delegation obviously we all came here to do this and its very hard to continue on
3028155 to feel that feeling of helplessness we just kind of talked and thought the best thing we can do is go out and play volleyball
3028156 after i got cut from the last olympics i didnt know if i was ever going to be an olympian things changed and i came back and im very excited about it
3028157 i called merrill and said look im going to be coaching through beijing
3028158 i want you to think about joining the team and being part of this
3028159 you just want it that much more i was a lot younger and when i came back i was a lot more focused a lot more motivated to make sure that this dream happened
3028160 ive always worked hard but now you just go the extra mile
3028161 it took about six months to get back in the groove of things
3028162 you lose your speed you lose your legs its amazing
3028163 compared to how he is now you would consider him really out of shape he slowly got back into it now hes very competitive every day really intense really focused
3028164 when we get games going he has a fire inside of him he very much wears his emotions on his shoulders it could be a good thing it could be a bad thing as long as he focuses it in the right direction its a good thing a positive thing
3028165 goalies need to give direction the balls over here the balls over there you need to help somewhat on offense with the shot clock and where the ball is and stuff like that
3028166 people have told me im probably one of the most vocal goalkeepers out there
3028167 im very loud out there it kind of pumps me up but i like to let my players know whats going on too
3028168 ive had coaches sometimes say tone it down a little bit
3028169 sometimes you get so caught up in talking that you can miss the ball
3028170 you start doing all this talking and start doing too much you lose focus on what youre supposed to be doing it happens to him sometimes it happens to everybody sometimes
3028171 he basically came in on his recruiting trip and told the starting goalie he was going to take his job and he did
3028172 in college especially when youre a freshman its like baby steps at this level theres no baby steps
3028173 i think he has really had to grow up both as a player and a person and get to a position where he can get that same level of confidence back as an international player
3028174 you need to be confident you need to see the ball well you need to believe in yourself and your defense in front of you and that all takes time to get to at this level but i can see merrill getting a lot closer to where he needs to be with that for sure
3028175 we simply must do everything we can in our power to slow down global warming before it is too late the science is clear the global warming debate is over
3028176 americans are coming to understand that global temperatures have actually cooled over the last 10 years and are predicted to continue cooling over the next 10
3028177 if you look from 1995 you dont see any change that could be regarded as statistically significant for the last 13 or 14 years nothing has been happening
3028178 if you take the last 30 years its completely evident that its going up
3028179 this is a challenge for climate modelers we dont fully understand it
3028180 if we knew the answer to things like this one would have more confidence
3028181 the whole notion that something outside has to cause a change is absurd
3028182 weve looked at the sun volcanoes are not doing anything weird the oceans can dump heat into the atmosphere but theyre getting warmer too

3028185 china is a sleeping giant but when she awakes the world will tremble
3028186 do you think that the us was showing off too much
3028187 were they showing numbers of circus just to impress the crowds
3028188 going to the ready room i started getting like kind of like chills up my body right then and there i knew i was starting to get more excited
3028189 i wasnt comfortable after the first 200 and seeing everyone so close together
3028190 that usually is not how it is after the first 200 usually thats the 300 mark after the breaststroke
3028191 i think it made my breaststroke a lot stronger at that point coming home on freestyle is all adrenaline
3028192 i looked up and saw him after the race and he nodded and waved the american flag
3028193 thats a pretty special feeling i waved and nodded my head back thats definitely pretty neat having the president here tonight and having him cheer us all on
3028194 i knew being a rookie and the youngest on the team i wasnt going to come in and throw a lot i knew i had to be ready for the japan game in 04 and thats what i prepared all summer for
3028195 i spent a lot of the games in the bullpen and thats all right i was ready to go if they needed me but they didnt need me the way we score runs
3028196 i was under loris wings from day one not only because she was a lefty but also because we were the two pitchers who didnt hit
3028197 she did a good job of letting me grow up on my own she pushed me enough but she didnt push me too hard
3028198 i was raw and hadnt done any kind of international competition and lori tried to keep me calm mentally and told me what to expect once we got to the olympic games
3028199 we need all three of them but we need her osterman to really be on top of her game for us to have the opportunity at a gold medal
3028200 cat is cat she spins the ball better than anyone in the world she is a kid who is not going to be the hardest thrower but she has more movement than anyone she has matured a lot in the mental part of the game we had her last time as a girl out of college now shes a woman she has been in the tough games and is very seasoned
3028201 i dont think this is a game where you have to have complete games out of everyone i could see using two pitchers and possibly three in a game
3028202 i have seen improvement in hitters making adjustments quicker so its kind of nice if you can give them a different look after they have been through the lineup i am going to have a pretty quick hook because we have the talent to give them a different look
3028203 weve talked all along about building on small successes one after the other
3028204 and this is a small success now they build on it
3028205 we knew the game was going to be called tightly
3028206 and i knew if i did my job wed win and i just blocked the things i needed to block and our team played great team defense
3028207 im going to be honest be prepared for him to score a lot of goals against every time we dont only have tony we have a lot of firepower a lot of people that can shoot tony just stepped up today hes a great captain and thats his job
3028208 and it really helps we have ryan bailey in the two meter position everyone comes back to him they leave me and i just put the ball away
3028209 because the u s team is comparatively stronger the score was pretty good for us because in the past when we have competed against them we did significantly worse
3028210 theyve worked hard and from where we saw them a couple years ago theyve improved dramatically theyve put a lot into it over this last two year period and theyve definitely gotten better and better
3028211 i think everyone looks at china definitely as a team that can beat you if you dont play your a game
3028212 we have some rest tomorrow but well be practicing twice and going through italy and ill definitely be looking at a lot of tape
3028213 that sword scene is just hilarious i just love it
3028214 i think the fencing outfit is clearly a very hot outfit
3028215 im surprised theres not a sports illustrated fencing edition where they put celebrities in fencing outfits
3028216 i think id be all right but hopefully that will not come to fruition
3028217 i feel like part of my job is to be an educator in the sport
3028218 and to get people involved in it so im more than willing to answer any questions people may have
3028219 thats when i started to think that maybe i can make an olympic team
3028220 i think fencing has had a huge impact on my life in every aspect
3028221 i think the biggest application is just finding a model for what its like to be successful and i think ive really started to find that
3028222 theres lots of things that go into it how to set goals how to develop plans that work how to deal with the challenges of trying to reach that goal and then as you start to get stronger how to allow yourself mentally to break through
3028223 but i was like its olympic qualifying so im definitely getting on this plane
3028224 the teachers ive worked with in training theyre absolutely the heroes to me
3028225 with sports and with the olympics you get so much credit and you know its very public and you get to feel really proud about what you do but we have a lot of teachers doing amazing things and its not like theyre doing it because theyre getting public acknowledgement theyre just doing it because theyre passionate about education
3028226 i have my sport and education is another really huge passion for me i feel really lucky in that regard
3028227 his last 50 were absolutely incredible he had a perfect finish
3028228 theres never been a split like this in my memory not running down somebody who holds the world record whos on their game that was incredible
3028229 the 400 free relay has been spanked around the last two olympics
3028230 this was the toughest one to win those are always the best ones to win
3028231 when i flipped at the 50 and saw how far ahead he was the thought crossed my mind for a split second theres no way then it flipped no im here representing the my country
3028232 i got a supercharge and took it from there it was unreal
3028233 that split it had to be the best ever thats the kind of anchor you dream of it shows what you can do when you dont think about it you just go
3028234 it really was probably the biggest learning experience of my life
3028235 we grew a lot as a group together individually we matured a lot more and learned a lot about hollywood everything that goes along with the entertainment industry the good and the bad we definitely had to deal with it
3028236 depending on the challenge and the music and the story we were trying to tell choreographing could take one night or a whole week
3028237 it was 14 hour days and maybe four or five hours of sleep every night youd wake up and go back to dancing

3028242 it would be very tough to convince religious people that the novel isnt pretending to be the correct history
3028243 what i really strove to do with this book is to get womens voices into islamic history
3028244 shes got the world debating a book no one has even read
3028245 if i do have threats of violence shes done it by alerting the muslims by calling it soft core porn by saying it made fun of islam
3028246 we understand the book is not historical documentation but it still uses the real characters of aisha and muhammad
3028247 it would be very tough to convince religious people that the novel isnt pretending to be the correct history

3028249 all problems of the darjeeling hills would be sorted out amicably in time to come
3028250 if development of the darjeeling region has not taken place over the years the blame should go to those who were ruling the dghc for over two decades
3028251 the identity of the gorkhas has always been misconceived as that of immigrants
3028252 its true i see people like kipketer lebron james kobe bryant yao ming all the top athletes in the world
3028253 so yes i do ask them for pictures because for me this is the memory which is going to stay in my life forever
3028254 of course i do get approached from the other athletes to get asked for the picture
3028255 you know tennis is played 10 months out of 12 in the year at least so they see a lot of us on the tv obviously
3028256 he opened his eyes on his own and looked at rhonda she called his name and he opened his eyes and nodded to her she smiled at him and told him dont leave me im waiting for you to come back he shrugged his shoulders and she said thats when she knew he was tired he signaled to her that his body was tired

3028259 thanx to all of u who are genuinely concerned about the recent report of reginae being killed in a car accident it means a lot to our family to know that so many of u care calls have been coming in to our family all day amp are continuing to do so i am pleased to inform u that this report is false it is merely a rumor started by someone who obviously is miserable in their own skin that they would even have the notion to attack a child rest assured reginae is tucked away in her bed this very moment trying to get past the hurt this ugliness has caused her and our family its ironic however that although the evil hellbound expletive that started this hate mail did something like this to reginae she still said a special prayer for them 2nite this is naes aunt amp all of the responses that i wanted give all went out the window when i heard that prayer so to all of our extended family amp friends amp fans please join us in saying a special prayer for the lost soul who simply had nothing better to do be sure to include lord please forgive them for they know not what they do
3028260 everyone was excited about this vehicle people were stopping to take pictures honking their horns the response was phenomenal
3028261 we have had an increase in clients looking for customized promotional vehicles that go beyond our carwraps and the increased buzz has been definitely worth it
3028262 if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
3028263 proud of the courage john showed by his honesty in the face of shame
3028264 weve had countless calls from homeowners interested in renting out their properties
3028265 but many are waiting in the expectation that they will get more money nearer the games
3028266 most properties in vancouver are sitting at the 400 per bedroom per night rate
3028267 which seems to me a level which may prove comparable to hotel rates
3028268 there are 75 000 hotel rooms and an estimated 300 000 visitors
3028269 anywhere along the skytrain or the rail lines as far out as abbotsford and mission which involve a journey time of a little more than an hour as long as the price is flexible and reasonable may be good options for families on a budget
3028270 i expect visitors to start locking in their bookings soon after beijing is over
3028271 i didnt think my wife would be keen but when we saw we could charge 30 000 she figured it might just be worth it
3028272 a relative of a friend answered the door to their place in whistler and someone offered them 35 000 on the spot
3028273 its a huge inconvenience for us to move out of our home and we should be properly compensated
3028274 but i started talking to other people in whistler about why they werent putting their properties up for rent and they were saying they didnt want to miss the once in a lifetime opportunity of being part of the olympics
3028275 we are seven adults and a five month old baby this time
3028276 we have rented a condo three kilometres from the main stadium and on a subway line for 4 000 the owner is picking us up from the airport buying a car seat for my baby granddaughter and giving us all brand new sheets and towels
3028277 i think 500 per night is a reasonable price for us
3028278 the rapid real estate price rise means that many people are looking for ways to help their mortgage
3028279 theyre not interested in making sure the guests really enjoy their stay its not about being an ambassador for vancouver
3028280 but i can tell you it is very very high
3028281 whether i provide the service or they dry hire the room the fee is the same
3028282 i built in wages and gratuity compensation for my staff and an expectation that whoever is here will break every glass and plate in the place the room will need repainting half the booths will be repaired
3028283 rather than book out an entire restaurant for the duration of the games i would rotate smaller groups providing their vips with a variety of meal options and we can still service our regular customers

3028286 is the goal of the russian federation to change the leadership of georgia
3028287 sometimes those leaders need to contemplate how useful they have become to their people
3028288 lets state clearly that we are ready to put an end to the war that we will withdraw from south ossetia that we will sign an agreement on non use of force
3028289 we must condemn russias military assault on the sovereign state of georgia including the targeting of civilians and the campaign of terror against the georgian population
3028290 since russia is impeding georgian forces from withdrawing rejecting a cease fire and continuing to carry out military attacks against civilian centers its claims of a humanitarian purpose clearly are not credible
3028291 this statement ambassador is completely unacceptable particularly from the lips of the permanent representative of a country whose actions we are aware of including with regard to the civilian populations in iraq and afghanistan and serbia

3028375 fao greatly appreciates nigerias swift reporting and sharing of the relevant information about this new virus strain
3028376 the detection of a new avian influenza virus strain in africa raises serious concerns as it remains unknown how this strain has been introduced to the continent
3028377 it seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to africa since the last migration of wild birds from europe and central asia to africa occurred in september 2007 and this years southerly migration into africa has not really started yet
3028378 it could well be that there are other channels for virus introduction international trade for example or illegal and unreported movement of poultry this increases the risk of avian influenza spread to other countries in western africa
3028379 uncertainty about virus spread and transmission is a major challenge for control campaigns increased surveillance is key to monitor the situation and keep track of virus spread

3028403 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered
3028404 an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
3028405 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective

3028410 es gab keine alternative nachdem georgien angefangen hat mit dieser grausamen offensive auch mit raketenangriffen
3028411 bekurow in l ndern wie deutschland und frankreich scheinen sich die medien m he zu geben den konflikt zu verstehen und ausgewogen zu berichten das sagen auch meine kollegen aber vor allem ber cnn und auch ber die bbc bin ich schockiert da sind im bild ganz klar georgische kampfjets zu sehen im text wird von russischen gesprochen und wenn im bild ossetische tote sind spricht der reporter von georgischen opfern wenn ich das sehe f hle ich mich hilflos
3028412 heute de glauben sie nicht dass da jemand in den tv redaktionen im aktualit tsdruck die bilder falsch zugeordnet oder interpretiert haben k nnte bekurow nein so offensichtliche fehler kann man nicht machen das ist absicht die osseten haben in den augen der welt ffentlichkeit die falschen helfer und werden deshalb voreilig als separatisten abgestempelt aber meiner meinung nach ist es das erste mal in der modernen geschichte dass russland in den kaukasus nicht als angreifer kommt sondern um die menschen zu verteidigen ich sage es noch mal georgien hat angefangen mit den angriffen
3028413 es waren die russen die anfingen sie sind in der nacht auf freitag einmarschiert nur deshalb stie en georgische streitkr fte nach s dossetien vor um den russen den nachschub abzuschneiden
3028414 russland hat die er ffnung der olympischen spiele dazu genutzt um sozusagen in ihrem windschatten einzumarschieren
3028415 wie der konflikt zu l sen ist im moment wohl gar nicht m sste man aus heutiger sicht sagen wenn man denn ehrlich ist sp ter vielleicht dadurch dass die s dosseten nach russland bersiedeln was nat rlich den bitteren beigeschmack einer deportation h tte und an stalins vertreibungen w hrend der vierziger jahre erinnern w rde die abchasen aber brauchen eine weitgehende autonomie

3028424 i was guaranteed to be starting running back because when i came in i was hungry just like other guys that are hungry
3028425 ive been getting in shape and getting conditioning in because last time i shared time with steve slaton and this year i have a bigger role in the offense
3028426 its just getting in shape and just the little things
3028427 ive seen some big holes and they are doing a great job whenever they can make me a smaller back and make it harder for the defense to see me its great because then i get some big holes
3028428 and its hard when you dont know too many people when youre comfortable youll feel alright and it will be a simple offense to learn
3028429 eight to me is not good enough well just have to go out and prove ourselves
3028430 i kept telling them i was in the same place they were and they just needed to relax and come out here and play and theyd be alright
3028431 i can just help them with the plays help them get comfortable and welcome them to our offense
3028432 instead of saying it you got to go out and do it
3028433 i try to always do extra more than anyone else
3028434 its about being above average and working harder than anyone else because theres people out there working harder too and im trying to work harder than them

3028447 we got testimony from the two escorts who claimed that i was intimidating them to the extent that they were afraid for their lives
3028448 once they were on the stand they testified that i never physically or verbally harmed them or used force in any way against them or anyone else
3028449 my attorney even asked the judge what i was supposed to do when the escorts come up to me and she said told him that i had to back away
3028450 after hearing the escort say that i was nice i thought for sure that the restraining order would be lifted
3028451 how could you keep a restraining order on a guy who is guilty of trying to be cooperative and nice the escorts testified that they were not afraid of me but after hearing all the testimony the judge ruled that the restraining order would stay in place
3028452 its because im pro life its like you know how pro lifers are they say that pro lifers are dangerous its such an explosive issue that they say that they feel uncomfortable but im going to appeal it
3028453 it was probably the most flagrant miscarriage of justice that ive seen in at least 15 years
3028454 its one thing when you have opponents who get up on the stand and lie but we couldnt have asked for a better factual record
3028455 they admitted that he did not threaten them did not touch them they admitted that he never used force or physically obstructed anyone which is what he is charged with
3028456 restraining orders are for crime victims who have been threatened by defendants you have the legal standard you have the evidence and then you have the outrage factor these people admit that they are blocking him yet the court says that not only does he have to stay away from them but he has to back off when they come toward him

3028497 a r ssia pode se contentar de mobilizar apenas uma pequena parte de seu enorme potencial militar neste pequeno setor

3028499 saakachvili colocou a r ssia numa situa o muito dif cil
3028500 n o havia projeto de enviar tropas ge rgia sem raz o mas nestas circunst ncias as autoridades russas n o tinham outra escolha com certeza uma linha vermelha para a r ssia
3028501 teria sido insensato da parte de saakachvili contar com um apoio militar direto do ocidente
3028502 mas o que o presidente georgiano conseguiu foi que o mundo inteiro v agora a r ssia como um agressor militar

3028505 what in the lords name would compel dale nabors to take over this company from morg morgan and doyle and the others when they are in such bad shape
3028506 i think what dale saw was a system with 100 units open had a potential if he could get everybody else open
3028507 so if he doesnt have any other capital available how is he able to move eight or ten people to alabama
3028508 he thought the company had a very expensive infrastructure that caused some of the problems and that there were too many employees he explained that the real estate was way too expensive being on the gulf of mexico
3028509 how can this continue how do you shut down a company like this obviously they are taking in capital they are moving capital around and they are not getting anything done they should be saying hey we cant get your deal done so heres your money back they cannot continue to ruin lives
3028510 they go out and spend the money while the franchisees are sitting on their own waiting to get opened how do you go about getting it stopped
3028511 if you think nabors is a con artist and still continuing to con then i think there might be justification to what you say if you think morgan is a con artist he is already shut down hes out of picture you could probably go find him if you think snowden is a con artist hes easy to find in the federal pen in florida
3028512 i dont disagree with you that there may have been criminal activity at some point that they were taking money that they knew wasnt going to where it should go
3028513 there has to be revenue coming in because they are paying employees
3028514 we didnt realize that in talking with these people one of them was going to be in federal prison he said he felt they were dealing with a bunch of crooks
3028515 thats false most franchises are much weaker than they appear to be the blue chip list of franchise opportunities is a very short list
3028516 they tell us they feel our pain lets make them feel our pain can you go after their personal assets can you put them in financial ruin
3028517 weve been as close a friend to them as anyone
3028518 the states also have that capability but good luck guys when you made the decision to invest with a company in trust you incurred the situation that we all do that the guy at the other end is going to keep his word and if he doesnt keep his word we have the courts to rectify that the courts in my opinion are the only dispensers of justice to people who can afford it
3028519 every group we talk to we discuss what is the goal we have i suspect the goal we have for your group is to recover your money or in some instances to get your building done so you can either be an independent or for some of you continue to be cuppys franchisees then how do we pursue a strategy that will succeed with that goal
3028520 now the question is do you want revenge or do you want your money back revenge might be sweet but you have to start with what your goal is

3028533 the goal was not to overengineer our tools for the data entry effort
3028534 but to build something very quickly that would let people lend a hand the solution we came up with was adequate to let 3 000 people participate and 3 000 people lightly coordinated can do impressive things
3028535 one of the reasons peoplefinder was deployed so quickly is that we had no one to answer to when no one is approving your work its an invitation to solve problems in whatever way you want i suspect there are many folks involved with the government response who wished theyd had that much flexibility and freedom
3028536 that is because the recovery in crude oil is momentary there is some amount of demand fall and that could bring it down
3028537 gold is bearish as the dollar has gained a lot
3028538 there is a good support for gold and crude around their current levels

3028544 have you ever seen santa claus on christmas eve or had any experiences that helped you know that santa is real

3028550 well i hope some ignorant person doesnt just look at it and toss it aside not knowing what it is
3028551 maybe this is a sign of the times but times have always been rough
3028552 it is unfortunate that we have to put in cameras and lock the doors to take these measures

3028557 just the fact that its coming from the eyes and its a red color like blood i would say that theres a miracle either way
3028558 with christmas coming up they say jesus is the reason as opposed to the commercialization
3028559 so maybe this is happening for a reason i just think shes crying for all the sins of the world and everything
3028560 the blood was on her chest we came back the next day and it had run all the way down her dress
3028561 i felt like i need to be here to see this
3028562 but the number that turn out to be miraculous are very very rare
3028563 i think we need to respect peoples experience through the eyes of faith
3028564 and god does use these things to bring us closer to him
3028565 i think many people have forgotten about god and i think shes weeping about gods children who are lost and are searching and looking for answers

3028569 i dont have to worry about listening to beatnik poetry or some political ideology that makes me want to vomit
3028570 conservative doesnt mean you belong to a certain political party
3028571 it caused me a little bit of a problem but people should get over it
3028572 instead there is clear evidence that womens changing role is viewed as having costs both for the woman and the family
3028573 it is conceivable that opinions are shifting as the shine of the super mum syndrome wears off and the idea of women juggling high powered careers while also baking cookies and reading bedtime stories is increasingly seen to be unrealisable by ordinary mortals
3028574 women particularly mothers can experience considerable strain when attitudes reinforce the notion that employment and family interests conflict
3028575 if we are to make progress in devising policies that encourage equal working opportunities for women we need to know more about what gender roles people view as practical as possible and as fair
3028576 the long working hours culture and lack of flexible working means women are presented with impossible choices forced to choose between caring for a family at home or maximising their career opportunities
3028577 the result is that motherhood carries a penalty and women and men are strait jacketed by gender stereotypes

3028591 an organized campaign to subvert us immigration laws impede the assimilation of immigrants and cultivate the existence of a vast pro mexican lobby in the united states
3028592 this effort has scarcely begun but is already bearing fruit

3028594 im not going to say im at her level but i like to think id appeal to the readers of blah oblah because we share a style and whatever whatever
3028595 every single quality of life problem we have in america has been created or exacerbated by mexicans
3028596 when we told this to the person the person said i dont care
3028597 we went a little bit farther than weve ever gone before
3028598 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3028599 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3028600 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3028601 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3028602 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3028603 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3028604 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3028605 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3028606 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3028607 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3028608 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3028609 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3028610 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3028611 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3028612 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3028613 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3028614 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3028615 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3028616 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3028617 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3028618 a grand human quest since antiquity has been to understand the basic structure of matter forces space and time
3028619 the lhc is designed to take us in the next step in that quest
3028620 do you really imagine if i wasnt 100 percent convinced that i would endanger my family theres no danger none
3028621 it is as if mars were enveloped in clouds and the very first glimpse we get of anything below the clouds is when we land a rover on the surface
3028622 theres a huge intrinsic benefit in better understanding our place in the cosmos its a basic human drive the questions weve been answering are some of the most basic questions mankind has asked for millennia along with some new ones
3028623 we like to think that we are re writing our childrens science textbooks
3028624 in the same way that galileo revolutionized our thinking about our place in the universe we hope our discoveries will give us new insight into mankinds place in the universe
3028625 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3028626 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3028627 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3028628 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3028629 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3028630 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3028631 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3028632 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3028633 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3028634 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3028635 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3028636 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3028637 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3028638 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3028639 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3028640 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3028641 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3028642 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3028643 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3028644 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3028645 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3028646 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3028647 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3028648 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3028649 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3028650 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3028651 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3028652 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3028653 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3028654 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3028655 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3028656 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3028657 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3028658 it all confirms our numerous warnings addressed to the international community that it is necessary to pay attention to massive arms purchasing by georgia during several years now we see how these arms and georgian special troops who had been trained by foreign specialists are used
3028659 russia has already begun consultations with the ambassadors of the nato countries and consultations with nato military representatives will be held tomorrow
3028660 we will caution them against continuing to further support of saakashvili
3028661 it is an undisguised aggression accompanied by a mass propaganda war
3028662 start military action against abkhazia however the abkhaz fortified region turned out to be unassailable for georgian armed formations therefore a different tactic was chosen aimed against south ossetia which is more accessible territorially
3028663 those with whom he is negotiating georgias accession to nato
3028664 some powerful weapons through the upgrade of su 25 planes and artillery systems in israel
3028665 claiming that us as well as nato and israeli military assistance to georgia is destabilizing the region
3028666 georgia has received 206 tanks of which 175 units were supplied by nato states 186 armored vehicles 126 from nato 79 guns 67 from nato 25 helicopters 12 from nato 70 mortars ten surface to air missile systems eight israeli made unmanned aircraft and other weapons in addition nato countries have supplied four combat aircraft to georgia the russian defense ministry said there were plans to deliver to georgia 145 armored vehicles 262 guns and mortars 14 combat aircraft including four mirazh 2000 destroyers 25 combat helicopters 15 american black hawk aircraft six surface to air missile systems and other arms
3028667 said there were no plans to redeploy the estimated 130 us troops and civilian contractors who he said were stationed in the area around tblisi

3028670 turkey and israel are negotiating the construction of a multi million dollar energy and water project that will transport water electricity natural gas and oil by pipelines to israel with the oil to be sent onward from israel to the far east
3028671 baku oil can be transported to ashkelon via this new pipeline and to india and the far east
3028672 ceyhan and the mediterranean port of ashkelon are situated only 400 km apart
3028673 georgian casualty figures ranged from 82 dead including 37 civilians to a figure of around 130 dead a russian air strike on gori a georgian town near south ossetia left 60 people dead many of them civilians georgia says
3028674 our research shows that over a third of people privately renting are doing so because they cant get a mortgage at the moment
3028675 the cost of living is rising rapidly and average earnings are not keeping pace and while rental rates appear to have dropped marginally in the last few months its going to continue to be tough for many tenants
3028676 mr fawoles actions were serious and blatant and he poses an immediate risk to lenders we have banned a number of mortgage brokers and others this year in connection with mortgage fraud and we will continue to make examples of people who commit mortgage fraud until behaviour changes
3028677 perpetrators of fraud will increasingly find themselves facing bans and significant fines as well as action by the police or other agencies aimed at confiscation of assets
3028678 the few buyers that were out in the market place have put their plans on hold in the hope that moving house will become cheaper in the next month or so this dithering by the government is making a desperate situation even starker
3028679 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3028680 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3028681 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3028682 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3028683 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3028684 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3028685 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3028686 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3028687 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3028688 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
3028689 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3028690 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3028691 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3028692 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3028693 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3028694 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3028695 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3028696 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3028697 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3028698 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3028699 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3028700 who are open to doing something on the production side
3028701 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3028702 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3028703 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3028704 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3028705 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3028706 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3028707 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3028708 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3028709 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3028710 the pipeline is only a minor element in a much larger strategic equation an attempt sponsored largely by the united states but eagerly subscribed to by several of its new ex soviet allies to reduce every aspect of russian influence throughout the region whether it be economic political diplomatic or military
3028711 has his escalation of the south ossetian crisis done more than destroy any chance of normalising georgian relations with russia as long as he remains president has it reinforced his image among many western leaders as a hothead and set back his hopes of getting a promise from nato this autumn to start membership proceedings
3028712 when the fighting ends and the dust settles saakashvili may also face an onslaught from his political opposition in georgia in the heat of battle parliamentary leaders have rallied round the national flag but if a ceasefire comes with all georgian troops and civilians driven out of south ossetia and abkhazia saaksahvili may be called to account for losing not just territory but the chance of early membership of nato as well
3028713 were ulstermen and weve paid for this holiday and were going to enjoy it the drink and food is cheap and the people are wonderful and this is a very interesting time to be here why would we want to go home early
3028714 our message today is simple dont bury your head in the sand the right help at the right time can make the difference between losing your home and keeping it
3028715 being in debt can bring misery to a lot of people but losing your home on top would be harder still that is why i am so pleased to see a scheme that stops people from sliding into deeper and deeper debt

3028722 es gab keine alternative nachdem georgien angefangen hat mit dieser grausamen offensive auch mit raketenangriffen
3028723 bekurow in l ndern wie deutschland und frankreich scheinen sich die medien m he zu geben den konflikt zu verstehen und ausgewogen zu berichten das sagen auch meine kollegen aber vor allem ber cnn und auch ber die bbc bin ich schockiert da sind im bild ganz klar georgische kampfjets zu sehen im text wird von russischen gesprochen und wenn im bild ossetische tote sind spricht der reporter von georgischen opfern wenn ich das sehe f hle ich mich hilflos
3028724 heute de glauben sie nicht dass da jemand in den tv redaktionen im aktualit tsdruck die bilder falsch zugeordnet oder interpretiert haben k nnte bekurow nein so offensichtliche fehler kann man nicht machen das ist absicht die osseten haben in den augen der welt ffentlichkeit die falschen helfer und werden deshalb voreilig als separatisten abgestempelt aber meiner meinung nach ist es das erste mal in der modernen geschichte dass russland in den kaukasus nicht als angreifer kommt sondern um die menschen zu verteidigen ich sage es noch mal georgien hat angefangen mit den angriffen
3028725 es waren die russen die anfingen sie sind in der nacht auf freitag einmarschiert nur deshalb stie en georgische streitkr fte nach s dossetien vor um den russen den nachschub abzuschneiden

3028735 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3028736 the russians responded by bombing the civilian airport in georgias capital tblisi and by stepping up its offensive in abkhazia this should be unacceptable to all the democratic countries of the world and should draw us together in universal condemnation of russian aggression
3028737 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution befo the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3028738 we should move ahead with the resolution despite russian veto threats and submit russia to the court of world public opinion

3028742 what the people of georgia have accomplished in terms of democratic governance a western orientation and domestic reform is nothing short of remarkable
3028743 in recent days moscow has sent its tanks and troops across the internationally recognized border into the georgian region of south ossetia
3028744 the implications of russian actions go beyond their threat to the territorial integrity and independence of a democratic georgia
3028745 yesterday georgia withdrew its troops from south ossetia and offered a ceasefire
3028746 russian president medvedev and prime minister putin must understand the severe long term negative consequences that their governments actions will have for russias relationship with the u s and europe it is time we moved forward with a number of steps
3028747 the united states and our allies should continue efforts to bring a resolution before the un security council condemning russian aggression noting the withdrawal of georgian troops from south ossetia and calling for an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of russian troops from georgian territory
3028748 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia a partnership for peace nation
3028749 the secretary of state should begin high level diplomacy including visiting europe to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3028750 the u s should work with azerbaijan and turkey and other interested friends to develop plans to strengthen the security of the baku tbilisi ceyhan oil pipeline
3028751 the u s should send immediate economic and humanitarian assistance to help mitigate the impact the invasion has had on the people of georgia

3028819 we mixed soil samples with scrapie pathogens to find out how long the pathogens would survive
3028820 even after 29 months in other words more than two years we were still able to detect prions in the soil
3028821 the soil actually seems to increase the infectiousness of the pathogens the incubation period the time it takes for the disease to break out is exceedingly short even after the prions have persisted in the soil for 29 months all of the animals that were given contaminated soil became sick within a very short time these results indicate that fresh incidences of scrapie among sheep are due to contaminated pastures
3028822 to find this out we urgently need to carry out further tests the appropriate research applications have already been submitted
3028823 it goes without saying that our simulation models can also be applied to all kinds of materials and used in other sectors of industry
3028824 people find these monotone sounds particularly unpleasant rather like the whining of a mosquito
3028825 these systems react autonomously to any change in frequency and damp the noise regardless of how fast the wind generator is turning
3028826 we have integrated sensors into the system they constantly measure the vibrations arising in the gearbox and pass on the results to the actuator control system
3028827 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
3028828 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
3028829 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
3028830 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
3028831 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
3028832 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
3028833 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
3028834 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials

3028839 starting in 1992 the marbella tourist corporation and other foreign investors in complicity with local authorities and military personnel began usurping property rights within the triunfo de la cruz community facing the risk of losing communal land titles local and national organizations came together to expose the corruption and managed so suspend the fraudulent operations
3028840 we find ourselves in a what can only be conceived as a war like situation
3028841 here we will resist until our death only in coffins will they manage to get us out of here
3028842 international financial organizations are also playing a role in this conflict the world bank funds a land administration program known as the program for the administration of lands in honduras path local organizations are afraid that this program is encouraging individual ownership of land at the expense of traditional communal land ownership practiced by groups such as the garifuna in the tela bay region in northern honduras this systemic problem is compounded by the los micos beach amp golf resort a massive planned hotel complex funded in part by the inter american development bank

3028879 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3028880 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3028881 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3028882 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3028883 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3028884 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
3028885 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3028886 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3029052 it was a tumultuous year and i could have done without all the headlines even encountered a few anxious moments but for the most part i felt pretty safe and welcome
3029053 i thought that i had to add 6 hours to get new york time
3029054 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
3029055 this is a planning took where all things are going
3029056 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
3029057 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
3029058 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
3029059 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
3029060 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
3029061 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
3029062 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
3029063 btid allows a vehicle to identify another friend if the friend has a btid on board or as an unknown if the vehicle does not have a btid
3029064 essentially what this offers is a quick means for a soldier to quickly talk to his coalition partner should the need arise in the tactical scenario
3029065 should there be anything in its cone of fire the machine gun operator will have a friendly in sector alert
3029066 he gets a blue visual indication if its a friendly and nothing if its clear
3029067 there was a marine joint terminal air controller on the ground with a btid interrogator scanning his target area getting similar responses from any friendly forces that were equipped with btid transponders
3029068 this enabled him to send that friendly force information directly to the cockpit of a strike aircrew that was another application of btid done for the first time in eglin
3029069 whats important here is that the fundamental military utility of btid has been assessed over the past few years but what bold quest plus did is add to the assessment with new applications of the same technology being tested
3029070 you had the canadians doing what maj groh just described the u s marines doing what i just described and all of these other things enhanced the analysis from previous assessments this was not a re do of previous testing
3029071 the biggest thing for us is that we are a much smaller force and what we get to do is work with other forces to develop a capability that is immediately able to be integrated with coalition partners
3029072 if we did this alone it would not work out wed bring something to the battlefield but it might not necessarily work with others here for everybody its a low cost way to make sure these things are integrated for when they come into operations
3029073 from our point of view we obviously collected a lot of information there pretty confident that having collected that much were going to in a few months have some analysis thats of value in both adding to the assessment of these technologies as well as pointing a way forward so i think it was well worth our time and money and effort to do what we did
3029074 chaque fois quon les trouve on va les arr ter et on va les pr senter la justice
3029075 major sequeira has not benefited from any formal training or accreditation in the management of searching for missing persons

3029088 the main interest in having kosovo take part in the beijing olympics was political kosovos flag would have been there representing our new state
3029089 she has won medals in all the european and world championships that she entered
3029090 kosovo was a champion in the former yugoslavia for five consecutive years
3029091 between 30 and 40 of the yugoslav boxing team was made up of kosovars

3029094 the balkans is departing from an era when demagogues secret police and thugs profited from sanctions busting and the smuggling of people arms cigarettes and drugs
3029095 the vicious circle of political instability leading to crime and vice versa that plagued the balkans in the 1990s has been broken
3029096 profiteers of the past are trying to launder their reputations and money through business and politics

3029105 we are missing the best player in the world in
3029106 even though they have won five of the last six ryder cups they have come in as underdogs i dont know how that works but this time it will be different
3029107 the top eight guys earned their spots and for many of them the ryder cup was foremost on their minds this weekend
3029108 the way this system was set up is to reward players who play well in the pga championship ben didnt lose pga championship padraig harrington went out and won it
3029109 experience is important but we have lost five of last six ryder cups so their experiences are bad experiences
3029110 these are the best us players we have got here i am really glad i didnt have to pick four players this morning i could have got burned by it now i have three weeks more weeks to make those picks

3029164 would only have led to a toughening of the chinese position
3029165 stunning contrast between the sumptuous celebrations and the splendour of the olympics and the terror that continues to reign across historic tibet
3029166 there is a little disappointment but as i said finals for olympics is not easy and she is ranked 5th although she did not meet her target of getting a bronze medal i still think she did very well
3029167 it has been an incredible performance she is the first singaporean to make it to an olympic finals to emerge 5th in this field a very strong field is a great result
3029168 i want to thank the people who made this possible the singapore sports school gave a conducive environment for her to excel
3029169 when our salary was increased it came along with rising prices in the market
3029170 we never expected a whole lot of people to get them but it did make sense to allow the use of raptors to control problem flocks of birds agricultural pests because in many ways thats probably more environmentally sound than other methods people might use

3029192 llevo un mes malo trabajando bien pero jugando pat tico tengo que seguir trabajando y esperar a que lleguen los buenos resultados eso se ha visto en el partido de hoy l ha merecido la victoria y ha sido superior en todo momento
3029193 he perdido la confianza quiz hay algunas cosas que no he hecho bien y que ahora me pasan factura ahora necesito tiempo ir a casa parar descansar para volver a empezar con ganas

3029201 last week i thought it would be interesting given that both the wall street journal and technewsworld had covered my professional relationship with dell regarding its new mp3 service to chat about what it would take to beat apple but in my analysis i left out one important thing apple is tricky already there are rumors of a redesigned ipod nano that would position well against this new dell offering and the apple funded sites seem to be aggressively trying to disparage this as yet unborn product someone seems scared to death of this as yet unborn product
3029202 apple funded sites seem to be aggressively trying to disparage this as yet unborn product
3029203 why do we do this because long ago we received the most important advice a computer user can ever receive get a mac we want to help spread that valuable advice
3029204 macdailynews ipoddailynews never receives compensation for any article posted on the websites we cover only products that interest us and products that our readers request be covered we do from time to time request and receive products for review purposes the receipt of such products does not guarantee a review will be conducted much less a good review
3029205 since we talked last week about how dell might create a successful service lets talk this week about the lengths apple might go to in order to stop them
3029206 apple has a set of top reporters that it feeds products to and who give it favorable reviews simply by spending time with them jobs can likely get them thinking negatively about dells new product and be primed to disparage it as soon as it actually launches though i doubt some will wait that long id be surprised if many arent already primed to go negative on this product even though it isnt finished yet
3029207 many arent already primed to go negative on this product even though it isnt finished yet
3029208 enderle apple funded sites already aggressively disparaging dell s as yet un stillborn mp3 player

3029217 het is niet verplicht je te melden bij de nederlandse ambassade in tbilisi dus een exact aantal kunnen we niet geven
3029218 hij of zij leert dan hoe met het gedrag van de militair om te gaan waarom hij nachtmerries heeft waarom hij zich terugtrekt
3029219 we werken onder meer aan een boekje voor kinderen waarin duidelijk wordt gemaakt waarom papa of mama zo anders doet ook leren gezinnen in de behandeling zich weer samen te ontspannen
3029220 dat zijn niet alleen militairen maar ook politieagenten brandweerlieden en ns personeel die lopen in hun werk soms tegen dezelfde problemen met geweld aan
3029221 er is een goed systeem voor nazorg daar worden ook vaak gezinnen bij de behandeling van getraumatiseerde militairen betrokken dus zo bijzonder is die aanpak van dat nieuwe behandelcentrum niet
3029222 iedereen mag in nederland natuurlijk zon centrum beginnen maar je breekt zo wel vertrouwen in de reguliere zorg af daar waar vertrouwen cruciaal is

3029232 im very close to my father and im going to lose him too one day thats part of life if you try change things in life that you cant change youll spend the whole day wondering why you were born
3029233 when something like this happens its always an opportunity for someone else nothing in life happens by chance its all planned
3029234 the one big plus is that fact the players were in a spot of bother on the field they didnt control the game the way we thought we could do but the fact that they could stand up and in retrospect see that we can do it if we only do our basics right worked for us
3029235 the big concern was the fact that individually they wanted to be the hero and wanted to win the game when it didnt go right
3029236 none of them did the basics right if you look at simple mistakes that players made that impacted the guy next to him and the guy next to him and then everyone wanted to rectify it instead of going back and just doing the basics right
3029237 what we can take from the game against argentina is that psychologically you have to be in the same frame of mind as your skill level if you cant do that youre an unbalanced person and an unbalanced person is an unbalanced rugby player
3029238 if you look down on people and you dont respect them then the same thing will happen to you in life we saw that italy beat argentina and the guys knew that we could give them 60 points here
3029239 i think its a south african thing its been there for years that people look down on people and dont respect them that kind of culture of respect we need to bring back into our lives its a biblical thing
3029240 the holes that came easily against argentina wont be there the all blacks defensive structure is one of the best with carter there their kicking game is outstanding
3029241 carter takes us back to the era of naas botha when he could control the game with his boot
3029242 in 2005 carter was not as experienced as he is now and you dont go back and look at things like that now with all the games that hes played a that experience that you dont buy at a supermarket on a sunday its comes from playing games under tremendous pressure
3029243 we tried a few things in wellington and we could never put him off his game and for us to go concentrate on a guy that is so strong wouldnt work
3029244 if you look at the wellington test we knew the frame of mind the all blacks would be in coming to dunedin
3029245 we knew exactly what was coming at us and we worked on the psychological part of it but that test is over and done with nothing from that test will come back to help us or haunt us on saturday
3029246 id prefer if they use weepu because hes a strong bugger and strong people like to overplay their hand and trust themselves more than their team mates
3029247 jimmy cowen poses a threat by running and thinking and kicking and putting other people into holes and stuff like that cowen is street wise very very street wise and you need those kinds of street wise players

3029272 in 96 when softball got on the program it was the biggest shot in the arm for our sport on all levels
3029273 i just know where our sport has come and what being in the olympics has done for our sport and i dont want to give it up
3029274 once we get back from beijing many of us will be on plane flights over to europe just spreading the word and the game
3029275 they had so many softball players in the country but just nowhere to really play
3029276 i think the rain this last day and a half helped but the first two days when we got here i was struggling with the pollution the heat the humidity
3029277 you could really feel it in your lungs when you started to breathe heavily
3029278 i did not think it was going to be like that i have yet to see blue sky or sun i thought maybe there was going to be a small smog layer in patches but its literally a haze
3029279 weve managed to adapt to the situation from home to china
3029280 there is some pollution but for me everything about the environment i just take it out i dont want an excuse i cant control the enviornment and the pollution i havent tried any different things like a mask because in the race you have to do the race without the mask
3029281 both teams were breathing the same air we were more concerned with the heat and humidity
3029282 so yes i do ask them for pictures because for me this is the memory which is going to stay in my life forever
3029283 of course i do get approached from the other athletes to get asked for the picture
3029284 you know tennis is played 10 months out of 12 in the year at least so they see a lot of us on the tv obviously
3029285 im being surrounded with the best athletes around the world its a privilege
3029286 we saw this when we arrived but at no time did anyone approach us nor did we sign anything like this we dont even know who that group is
3029287 theyve probably done it with him and other athletes its not surprising they put the names of famous athletes
3029288 as far as i know we do have his signature and he did express interest and his support of the campaign
3029289 however if he wishes to withdraw he can obviously do so
3029290 the guys rowed a really disciplined race and stayed focussed in our boat
3029291 this is the first time the americans have raced so it would be very foolish to think that this is all theyve got they are not olympic champions for nothing
3029292 the canadians will be the challenge on sunday without a shadow of a doubt
3029293 id love to have won today but id have got it in the neck if id have gone harder through the middle
3029294 we found a better and more efficient rhythm so that we could sprint the last 250 metres
3029295 i think the rain this last day and a half helped but the first two days when we got here i was struggling with the pollution the heat the humidity
3029296 you could really feel it in your lungs when you started to breathe heavily
3029297 i did not think it was going to be like that i have yet to see blue sky or sun i thought maybe there was going to be a small smog layer in patches but its literally a haze
3029298 weve managed to adapt to the situation from home to china
3029299 there is some pollution but for me everything about the environment i just take it out i dont want an excuse i cant control the enviornment and the pollution i havent tried any different things like a mask because in the race you have to do the race without the mask
3029300 both teams were breathing the same air we were more concerned with the heat and humidity

3029302 all credit for this win belongs to abhinav i have done nothing if at all i have done anything it is only to provide assistance and support but it was he who took that support and transformed it into this terrific achievement this is the moment the whole country has been waiting for and abhinav has given it to us
3029303 i just told him to do his best and he lived up to our expectations to avoid nay nay pressure i did not talk to him about shooting too much expectation can sometimes be counter productive i havent even spoken to him for the last four days but today he has given me the happiest moment of my life
3029304 i have expected him to win on earlier occasions too but today is not the time to remember past failures its time to celebrate i will go to darbar sahib amritsar to pay obeisance offer prayers and wish for his well being

3029326 initially when he was hospitalized we expected him to come back home but as the weeks went on i kind of knew
3029327 he was a hard man and he made no apologies for that
3029328 when it came to me and my mother and my daughter he was the softest
3029329 i kind of figured he was going to get a lot of backlash
3029330 telling that joke at that time probably wasnt the best idea but thats him
3029331 im sad that my daughter will never know or be able to feel how much he loved her
3029332 i think he will always be remembered as one of the original kings of comedy
3029333 i think what made him so special to people was that even though he was a celebrity he just seemed so down to earth and so much like a part of your family
3029334 that feeling of being powerful and sexy in those shoes
3029335 living like you mean it use the wisdom and power of your emotions to get the life you really want
3029336 a natural high that pleasant feeling one experiences during and after a certain activity like running or strenuous exercise has to do with the release of endorphins as well as other mood regulating hormones such as adrenaline serotonin cortisol and melatonin orgasm also produces a flood of endorphins which is what makes us feel calm and relaxed after sex
3029337 when you pull yourself up onto a summit and climax so to speak particularly as a woman the sheer physicality beauty and endurance are like no other feeling on earth

3029341 being overly active or addicted to working out as a means to regulate ones anxiety
3029342 research has shown that addictive substances like alcohol nicotine and heroin activate a single pleasure circuit in the deepest and oldest part of the brain
3029343 people become addicted to these substances because their systems become used to higher levels of dopamine and when they dont get it feel deprived a drug floods the brain with dramatic levels of dopamine that are not the same as what is produced during a natural high
3029344 but they dont have the same propensity to become addictive
3029345 i had told him not to and when i asked why he did it he said he just couldnt resist
3029346 ive seen plenty of disgusted and disgruntled parents come in with phone bills in the hundreds of dollars for their kids
3029347 and then theres the fact that kids will be kids they play rough with and lose their toys a phone will be no different
3029348 theres a huge difference between feeling safer and being safer
3029349 a cell phone is with the person who controls it and most parents dont check cell phones
3029350 we do not have enough information nor do we have enough time to be sure that cell phones are safe and theres reason for concern that they may be harmful
3029351 i was so busy with school and sports that i rarely used the phone
3029352 its just like anything else and you have to monitor it
3029353 there will of course be a universal language which will be either esperanto or pidgin english
3029354 the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual
3029355 the nineteenth century suffered from a curious division between its political ideas and its economic practice in politics it carried out the liberal ideas of locke and rousseau which were adapted to a society of small peasant proprietors its watchwords were liberty and equality but meantime it was inventing the technique which is leading the twentieth century to destroy liberty and to replace equality by new forms of oligarchy the prevalence of liberal thought has been in some ways a misfortune since it has prevented men of large vision from thinking out in an impersonal manner the problems raised by industrialism socialism and communism it is true are essentially industrial creeds but their outlook is so much dominated by the class war that they have little leisure to give to anything but the means of achieving political victory traditional morality gives very little help in the modern world a rich man may plunge millions into destitution by some act which not even the severest catholic confessor would consider sinful while he will need absolution for a trivial sexual aberration which at the worst has wasted an hour that might have been more usefully employed there is need of a new doctrine on the subject of my duty to my neighbour it is not only traditional religious teaching that fails to give adequate guidance on this subject but also the teaching of nineteenth century liberalism take for example such a book as mill on liberty mill maintains that while the state has a right to interfere with those of my actions that have serious consequences to others it should leave me free where the effects of my actions are mainly confined to myself such a principle however in the modern world leaves hardly any scope for individual freedom as society becomes more organic the effects of men upon each other become more and more numerous and important so that there remains hardly anything in regard to which mills defence of liberty is applicable take for example freedom of speech and of the press it is clear that a society that permits these is thereby precluded from various achievements which are possible to a society that forbids them in time of war this is obvious to everybody because in war time the national purpose is simple and the causation involved is obvious hitherto it has not been customary for a nation in peace time to have any national purpose except the preservation of its territory and its constitution a government which like that of soviet russia has a purpose in peace time as ardent and definite as that of other nations in war time is compelled to curtail freedom of speech and of the press as much while it is at peace as other nations do when they are at war the diminution of individual liberty which has been taking place during the last twenty years is likely to continue since it has two continuing causes on the one hand modern technique makes society more organic on the other hand modern sociology makes men more and more aware of the causal laws in virtue of which one mans acts are useful or harmful to another man if we are to justify any particular form of individual liberty in the scientific society of the future we shall have to do it on the ground that that form of liberty is for the good of society as a whole but not in most cases on the ground that the acts concerned affect nobody but the agent
3029356 the man who dreams of a scientifically organized world and wishes to translate his dream into practice finds himself faced with many obstacles there is the opposition of inertia and habit people wish to continue behaving as they always have behaved and living as they always have lived there is the opposition of vested interest an economic system inherited from feudal times gives advantages to men who have done nothing to deserve them and these men being rich and powerful are able to place formidable obstacles in the way of fundamental change in addition to these forces there are also hostile idealisms christian ethics is in certain fundamental respects opposed to the scientific ethic which is gradually growing up christianity emphasizes the importance of the individual soul and is not prepared to sanction the sacrifice of an innocent man for the sake of some ulterior good to the majority christianity in a word is unpolitical as is natural since it grew up among men devoid of political power the new ethic which is gradually growing in connexion with scientific technique will have its eye upon society rather than upon the individual it will have little use for the superstition of guilt and punishment but will be prepared to make individuals suffer for the public good without inventing reasons purporting to show that they deserve to suffer in this sense it will be ruthless and according to traditional ideas immoral but the change will have come about naturally through the habit of viewing society as a whole rather than as a collection of individuals we view a human body as a whole and if for example it is necessary to amputate a limb we do not consider it necessary to prove first that the limb is wicked we consider the good of the whole body a quite sufficient argument similarly the man who thinks of society as a whole will sacrifice a member of society for the good of the whole without much consideration for that individuals welfare this has always been the practice in war because war is a collective enterprise soldiers are exposed to the risk of death for the public good although no one suggests that they deserve death but men have not hitherto attached the same importance to social purposes other than war and have therefore shrunk from inflicting sacrifices which were felt to be unjust i think it probable that the scientific idealists of the future will be free from this scruple not only in time of war but in time of peace also in overcoming the difficulties of the opposition that they will encounter they will find themselves organized into an oligarchy of opinion such as is formed by the communist party in the u s s r
3029357 in suggesting any curtailment of liberty there are always two quite distinct questions to be considered the first is whether such a curtailment would be in the public interest if it were wisely carried out and the second is whether it will be in the public interest when it is carried out with a certain measure of ignorance and perversity these two questions are in theory quite distinct but from the point of view of the government the second question does not exist since every government believes itself entirely free from both ignorance and perversity every government consequently in so far as it is not restrained by traditional prejudices will advocate more interference with liberty than is wise when therefore as in this chapter we are considering what interferences with liberty might be theoretically justified we must hesitate to draw the conclusion that they should be advocated in practice i think it probable however that almost all interferences with liberty for which there is a theoretical justification will in time be carried out in practice because scientific technique is gradually making governments so strong that they need not consider outside opinion the result of this will be that governments will be able to interfere with individual liberty wherever in their opinion there is a sound reason for so doing and for the reason just given this will be much more often than it should be for this reason scientific technique is likely to lead to a governmental tyranny which may in time prove disastrous
3029358 let us take some examples of traditional principles which appear no longer defensible to take a more important illustration consider the immense sums of money that are spent on advertising it cannot possibly be maintained that these bring any but the most meagre return to the community the principle of permitting each capitalist to invest his money as he chooses is not therefore socially defensible
3029359 take again the question of work both the kind of work and the method of performing it at present young people choose their own trade or profession usually because at the moment of their choice it seems to afford a good opening a well informed person possessed of foresight might know that the particular line in question was going to be much less profitable a few years hence in such a case some public guidance to the young might prove extremely useful and as regards technical methods it is seldom in the public interest that an antiquated or wasteful technique should be allowed to persist when a more economical technique is known at present owning to the irrational character of the capitalist system the interest of the individual wage earner is very often opposed to the interest of the community since economical methods may cause him to lose his job this is due to the survival of capitalistic principles in a society which has grown so organic that it ought not to tolerate them it is obvious that in a well organized community it should be impossible for a large body of individuals to profit by preserving an inefficient technique it is clear that the use of the most efficient technique should be enforced and no wage earner should be allowed to suffer by its enforcement
3029360 i come now to a matter which touches the individual more intimately i mean the question of propagation it has hitherto been considered that any man and woman not within the prohibited degrees have a right to marry and having married have a right if not a duty to have as many children as nature may decree this is a right which the scientific society of the future is not likely to tolerate in any given state of industrial and agricultural technique there is an optimum density of population which ensures a greater degree of material well being than would result from either an increase or a diminution of numbers as a general rule except in new countries the density of population has been beyond this optimum though perhaps france in recent decades has been an exception except where there is property to be inherited the member of a small family suffers almost as much from over population as the member of a large family those who cause over population are therefore doing an injury not only to their own children but to the community it may therefore be assumed that society will discourage them if necessary as soon as religious prejudices no longer stand in the way of such action the same question will arise in a more dangerous form as between different nations and different races if a nation finds that it is losing military superiority through a lower birth rate than that of a rival it may attempt as has already been done in such cases to stimulate its own birth rate but when this proves ineffective as it probably will there will be a tendency to demand a limitation in the birth rate of the rival nation an international government if it ever comes into being will have to take account of such matters and just as there is at present a quota of national immigrants into the united states so in future there will be a quota of national immigrants into the world children in excess of the licensed figure will presumably be subjected to infanticide this would be less cruel than the present method which is to kill them by war or starvation i am however only prophesying a certain future not advocating it quality as well as quantity of population is likely to become a matter for public regulation already in many states of america it is permissible to sterilized the mentally defective and a similar proposal in england is in the domain of practical politics this is only the first step as time goes on we may expect a greater and greater percentage of the population to be regarded as mentally defective from the point of view of parenthood however that may be it is clear that the parents who have a child when there is every likelihood of its being mentally defective are doing a wrong both to the child and to the community no defensible principle of liberty therefore stands in the way of preventing them from such behaviour
3029361 equality like liberty is difficult to reconcile with scientific technique since this involves a great apparatus of experts and officials inspiring and controlling vast organizations
3029362 the air and artillery bombardment left the provincial capital without water food electricity and gas horrified civilians crawled out of the basements into the streets as fighting eased looking for supplies
3029363 i thought that since u s is supporting georgia there would be some control over the situation in south ossetia and that there would be a peaceful solution to the conflict but what is happening there now its not just war but war crimes george bush and georgian president mikhail saakashvili should answer to the crimes that are being committed the killing of innocent people running over by tanks of children and women throwing grenades into cellars where people are hiding
3029364 the war is when military fight against military but the georgian army is killing innocent civilians this is genocide
3029365 while the ossetians claimed over 1000 dead the bbc neither reported this or any newsreel coming out of ossetia showing the destruction caused by the georgian shelling of the breakaway republic all we are getting is one sided reports of the destruction being caused by the russians
3029366 the bbc is giving carte blanche to the georgian point of view to be aired on its services while nothing whatsoever is being heard from the ossetian side the bbcs repetitive playing of a statement by george bush given several days ago without balancing these against statements from the russian side indicates where the bbc is coming from
3029367 georgia is an outpost of us and nato forces on the immediate border of the russian federation and within proximity of the middle east central asian war theater south ossetia is also at the crossroads of strategic oil and gas pipeline routes
3029368 georgia does not act militarily without the assent of washington the georgian head of state is a us proxy and georgia is a de facto us protectorate
3029369 in yesterdays attack the advancing tanks were supposedly crewed by ukrainians two unidentified bodies found today are said to have black skin possibly they are americans but we cant say for sure yet we will be able to publish the official conclusions after carrying out special tests
3029370 there are lots of bodies over there a lot of people have been killed mostly ossetians but also georgians they had american emblems on their forearms and they were in black uniforms
3029371 the further the situation unfolds the more the world will understand that georgia would never be able to do all this without america
3029372 in essence the americans have prepared the force which destroys everything in south ossetia attacks civilians and hospitals

3029381 our policy was that policing was proportionate to this threat
3029382 because of the level of resistance officers were authorised to carry batons during two days of the protest there are strict legal standards for their use and we gave clear warnings when any specialist team was deployed which is our policy those intent on breaking the law had the choice and opportunity to stop
3029383 our legal team are going to be exhausting every possible channel for holding the police accountable for the draconian use of stop and search measures for the things they confiscated and for their violent incursions on to the camp
3029384 every year police use the supposed existence of a hardcore minority as justification for their heavy handedness and every year this hardcore minority fails to materialise
3029385 there was no way of even finding all the current checklist projects without days of googling
3029386 as a result much of the great work thats going into developing community standards was being overlooked and different communities were at risk of developing mutually incompatible standards mibbi will help to prevent them from reinventing the wheel
3029387 communities working together through mibbi will produce non overlapping minimal information modules
3029388 the idea is that each checklist will fit neatly into a jigsaw with each community being able to take the pieces that are relevant to them
3029389 mibbi represents the first new effort taking the open biomedical ontologies obo as its role model
3029390 the mibbi portal operates in a manner analogous to obo as an open information resource while the mibbi foundry fosters collaborative development and integration of checklists into self contained modules just like the obo foundry does for the ontologies
3029391 referees decisions will tip the scales when athletes are relatively well matched but have relatively small influence when one is clearly superior
3029392 although there is a need for further research including research on the effects of different colors our results suggest a need to change the rules or support referees by providing electronic decision making aids in those sports in which this color bias may be a problem
3029393 this complicated network of causation has confounded efforts to understand cd says carol nacy ph
3029394 since among other things multiple studies identified the pathogen in tissues of cd patients treating some of these patients with antibiotics that target mycobacteria provided relief from symptoms
3029395 thanks to the concern of olympic organizers the chinese government and the cooperation of the korean government we have a huge and unprecedented opportunity to observe a large reduction in everyday emissions from a region thats very industrially active
3029396 capmex will be the very first uav campaign in east asia for air pollution and cloud interaction studies
3029397 this will be a very interesting experiment that can never happen again
3029398 ramanathans earlier research on atmospheric brown clouds demonstrated their importance in the polluted regions of the atmosphere
3029399 capmex takes this work an important step forward with new micro and nano sensor technologies these technologies will provide new estimates of solar irradiance aerosol cloud interactions climate forcing and important components of the biogeochemical cycles of the east asian and western pacific ocean region
3029400 black carbon in soot is a major contributor to global warming
3029401 by determining the effects of soot reductions during the olympics on atmospheric heating we can gain much needed insights into the magnitude of future global warming
3029402 with exposure to an environment that has poor quality air pollutants may trigger symptoms of asthma in a dose dependent manner
3029403 with the high minute ventilation amount of air breathed in one minute seen during exercise the effects of exposure to these pollutants are more noticeable in athletes than in non athletes and likely more evident in people with asthma than in those without asthma
3029404 however a significant percentage of the pollution about 35 at the olympic stadium can be attributed to sources outside beijing controlling only local sources of pollution may not be sufficient to achieve the air quality goal set for the beijing games
3029405 current policies to tackle hiv aids in africa emphasise individual behaviour such as the abc approach to prevention abstain be faithful condomise however these measures require that people have hope for the future and goals to aim for and if wider economic and social circumstances are so poor that people lack hope for the future then these current policies will have limited success
3029406 hope is quite straightforward to measure via questionnaires and surveys can help to identify high risk environments
3029407 although there is not a great deal of experience in developing programmes to increase hope policies such as cash support for children microfinance for small businesses womens education reduced discriminations against sexual minorities and health system reform will improve the wider environment and with more to live for interventions to encourage individuals to change their behaviour are more likely to succeed
3029408 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
3029409 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
3029410 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
3029411 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
3029412 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
3029413 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
3029414 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
3029415 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
3029416 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me
3029417 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
3029418 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
3029419 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
3029420 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
3029421 this is the first study in europeans to show a beneficial association on wet amd from the consumption of oily fish and is consistent with results from studies in the usa and australia two 3oz servings a week of oily fish such as salmon tuna or mackerel provides about 500 mg of dha and epa per day
3029422 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
3029423 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
3029424 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
3029425 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
3029426 we know that obese men tend to have lower psa values than their normal weight counterparts possibly caused by larger blood volumes which dilute the readings
3029427 now we know some of the real implications of this that these men are at a disadvantage in terms of prognosis compared to normal weight men
3029428 we used patient data to examine the association between body mass index or bmi a measure of obesity and the amount of disease discovered after surgery to remove the prostate
3029429 we compared men who had their cancers detected by psa screening to those who had an abnormal digital rectal exam which may not confer the same bias against obese men
3029430 in contrast obese men with abnormal digital rectal exams had similar outcomes as normal weight men
3029431 the aggressiveness of obese mens tumors coupled with the fact that they may be more difficult to remove is like a double whammy for being obese
3029432 the least we can do is find a way to level the playing field when it comes to diagnostic tools
3029433 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
3029434 we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
3029435 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special

3029439 den p g ende konflikten skapar en volatilitet p marknaden p kort sikt men vad som h nder p l ng sikt tycker jag att man n s l nge ska vara f rsiktig med att spekulera i
3029440 den h r fonden bygger ju p l ngsiktighet fr n f rsta b rjan och det h r kan v l ses som ett exempel p varf r det r s ven om ingen givetvis gick och f rv ntade sig att n got s dant h r skulle h nda
3029441 the soc is to get a few sets of cardiac enzymes on these patients and to perform a stress test if either is positive the patient may be considered for cardiac catheterization
3029442 at nearly every age level women are less likely to have coronary artery disease than men they are more likely to be found to have normal coronaries on cardiac ct and therefore more likely to be discharged since they are discharged costs go down
3029443 coronary ct angiography with high resolution ct scanners is an exciting innovation whose implications for health outcomes and medical care costs are poorly understood
3029444 i think our study brings us closer to understanding how patient care might be affected by its application and reinforcing the role of this technology in patient care
3029445 natos north atlantic council should convene in emergency session to demand a ceasefire and begin discussions on both the deployment of an international peacekeeping force to south ossetia and the implications for natos future relationship with russia
3029446 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
3029447 to establish a common euro atlantic position aimed at ending the war and supporting the independence of georgia
3029448 should coordinate with our partners in germany france and britain to seek an emergency meeting of the g 7 foreign ministers to discuss the current crisis
3029449 our united purpose should be to persuade the russian government to cease its attacks withdraw its troops and enter into negotiations with georgia
3029450 we must remind russias leaders that the benefits they enjoy from being part of the civilized world require their respect for the values stability and peace of that world
3029451 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
3029452 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
3029453 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
3029454 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
3029455 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
3029456 our study showed that functions can be maintained in older animals so long as damaged proteins continue to be efficiently removed strongly supporting the idea that protein buildup in cells plays an important role in aging itself
3029457 even more important these results show that its possible to correct this protein logjam that occurs in our cells as we get older thereby perhaps helping us to enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3029458 most people with these conditions are born with a mutation that gives rise to defective proteins but they dont experience symptoms until later in life
3029459 we think thats because their protein clearance systems can handle abnormal proteins when the person is younger but get overwhelmed as their efficiency falls with age by preventing this decline in protein clearance we may be able to keep these people free of symptoms for a longer time
3029460 theres reason to hope that drugs exerting a similar effect throughout the body may help us enjoy healthier lives well into old age
3029461 if you could be any superhero which superhero would you be
3029462 the study shows how dopamine shapes the two main circuits of the brain that control how we choose to act and what happens in these disease states
3029463 dopamine released by drugs leads to abnormal strengthening of the cortical synapses driving the striatal go circuits while weakening synapses at opposing stop circuits as a result when events associated with drug taking where you took the drug what you were feeling occur there is an uncontrollable drive to go and seek drugs
3029464 all of our actions in a healthy brain are balanced by the urge to do something and the urge to stop
3029465 our work suggests that it is not just the strengthening of the brain circuits helping select actions that is critical to dopamines effects it is the weakening of the connections that enable us to stop as well
3029466 the study illuminates why parkinsons patients have trouble performing everyday tasks like reaching across a table to pick up a glass of water when they are thirsty
3029467 our study suggests that the inability to move in parkinsons disease is not a passive process like a car running out of gas
3029468 rather the car doesnt move because your foot is jammed down on the brake dopamine normally helps you adjust the pressure on the brake and gas pedals it helps you learn that when you see a red light at an intersection you brake and when the green light comes on you take your foot off the brake and depress the gas pedal to go parkinsons disease patients who have lost the neurons that release dopamine have their foot perpetually stuck on the brake

3029495 mccain defends his outsider image after having embraced gop dogma for the primary
3029496 i do not believe in holding grudges in life or in politics
3029497 around 2005 or so he realized he was running for president and he made a calculated decision he was going to do whatever was necessary to win this office
3029498 i think the guy calls em as he sees em and as president would call em as he sees em and would make people mad all over the place because it wouldnt fit anybodys playbook
3029499 but the notion that somehow mccain is going to get in there and be some kind of ideological newt gingrich right winger is a joke theres no way that he would do that

3029520 the reality is that gay activists arent seeking equal access to marriage they can already marry it just must be to a person of the opposite sex
3029521 today we are in a cultural war over two views of sexuality our judeo christian sexual ethic of monogamous heterosexual marriage and the gay ethic of sexual license the battleground is the classroom and it is the children who will be the greatest casualties if we do not respond
3029522 under the guise of safety and diversity these activists are introducing children as young as first grade to sexual lifestyles that are unhealthy and dangerous these kids are encouraged to accept and celebrate perversity even before they have an understanding of normal sexuality

3029568 we already know that ptks are associated with several types of aggressive cancers including colon breast and lung cancers
3029569 what we have discovered is that ptks have an important role to play as cancer cells grow and mutate to become potentially more aggressive tumours
3029570 the more we can learn about how tumours develop the more we are able to prevent their growth in the future
3029571 we have identified one mechanism by which ptks may remain activated and allow cancer cells to bypass the molecular warden of dna replication

3029575 many players regard the unrest in georgia as a new reason to sell the euro as europe relies heavily on russia for oil supplies
3029576 we see no direct impact on russias economy from further development of the conflict in south ossetia
3029577 you pose a greater risk if you are in a city like moncton as oppose to a rural community outside of woodstock

3029583 the decrease in distributions was due largely to an increase in debt costs due to increases in interest rates as well as lower acquisition levels
3029584 the outsourcing trends that weve seen in australia and the uk over the past 10 or 15 years are really just beginning to get more momentum in the states
3029585 we have to not look at what is happening in the total us economy but the space were in which is the outsourced services space
3029586 despite the fact that commodity prices might be coming off theres not much doubt that we are going to see volumes keep increasing
3029587 were selling people locomotives and wagons and theres a big pipeline of projects in the resources sector
3029588 particularly towards the end of the economic cycle as more people become unemployed there are low barriers to entry and therefore there can be greater competition
3029589 its an impediment from the short term development of moolarben not a company stopper
3029590 if the leases are fully expunged then the worst case is they lose about 12 per cent of their resource that doesnt make the project uneconomic
3029591 xstrata i would have thought would have the most synergies
3029592 who is to say they dont come into this process at some stage
3029593 given the current uncertainties caused by the global credit crisis and the unknown of when confidence will re emerge in some sections of the financial market we are not going to provide specific guidance at this time
3029594 there are going to be plenty of tyre kickers but people with real appetite and capacity i believe are going to be mute
3029595 its not a major oil producer but there are major transport links to europe through that region
3029596 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states
3029597 whether we get an actual physical disruption in supply to europe that will be the critical thing
3029598 if it impacts on brent it is going to affect a much wider market and has the potential to send prices higher
3029599 losses have been pretty sharp in the last few weeks and theres always someone looking to buy on the dip
3029600 amanda is a new member of the team and the whole team did a bit of spring cleaning to re energise the offices feng shui
3029601 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
3029602 this is not long term investment this is short term speculation and the numbers that we are talking about are very significant
3029603 both of those positions would have paid handsomely but thats clearly being unwound
3029604 the speed of the move that weve seen in recent weeks would suggest that we are at a turning point
3029605 in hindsight we believe aldi has been the major beneficiary
3029606 aldi to now be a material competitive threat to many iga stores
3029607 yes people are more value conscious and they shop more often for smaller basket sizes which means they come to the local store
3029608 in tough times people shop more often for less they dont want to spend 200 in a massive woolworths store and be subject to all the promotions and impulse buys they spend 20 or 50 to feed the family for one or two days then come back it plays right into the hands of the local store
3029609 to rely on reaching 60 million tonnes ourselves out of that car dumper we needed to demonstrate we could consistently unload two iron ore cars every 90 seconds
3029610 the model is all predicated on them acquiring assets and recycling them at a profit
3029611 and now they are making provisions for losses on the assets that they acquired so the whole financial matrics becomes quite different

3029618 the panel agreed that the essence of the strategic planning process is focused on ends or desired outcomes and the means by which they are accomplished by framing the discussion around ends and means clarity of purpose in strategic planning is achieved
3029619 strategic planning is a critical management process for creating and sustaining organizational effectiveness it involves a systematic way to answer the following questions 1 what are the compelling reasons for our continuing existence 2 what is the nature of the environment in which we exist and how is it changing 3 what are the organizations current strengths and weaknesses 4 what must we accomplish to sustain our effectiveness 5 how do we seek to achieve our desired outcomes 6 how do we best deploy the necessary resources 7 how do we track our progress 8 how do we know whether we have succeeded 9 what did we learn about the process that can help us determine what to do better the next time
3029620 formal environmental assessment and forecasting or future focused research and deliberation should be incorporated into the periodic review and creation of a strategic plan
3029621 an analysis of the organizations strengths and weaknesses is key to evaluating its performance and its potential
3029622 all too often the issue of resources is overlooked in the planning process
3029623 common problems and mistakes that organizations should keep in mind

3029629 it got a standing ovation people realised why we held the festival
3029630 they came and the great thing was that they stayed and huddled under their tents and gazebos

3029805 theres no possibility a greenland shark could predate a live adult white bear unless it was injured or seriously ill
3029806 greenland sharks do seem quite sluggish but they have been known to move very quickly when they are eating
3029807 both walruses and polar bears are powerful in the water both could handle most potential predators but not killer whales
3029808 the greenland shark simply cannot afford the risk of injury nor the expenditure of energy required to kill such a large and dangerous animal with or without the help of global warming

3029818 some sports such as weightlifting have a pretty bad record and that is demonstrated time and again with numerous athletes from that sport
3029819 i think weightlifting understands as cycling understands that there is a huge risk for both those sports if the cheating is continued and continued to be exposed
3029820 there is no sport that anybody can suggest is doping free but there are some sports that have had a history and i would suggest theres a level or a culture of doping that has developed in some of those sports

3029834 i had to cancel the mountain bike races in the spring so i couldnt qualify
3029835 i was astonished that ivano fanini spoke of me directly to the press i categorically refute that i was in st moritz with dr ferrari
3029836 he should be disqualified because he prepared in st moritz with doctor michele ferrari instead he is still racing and winning races
3029837 as i explained in the press conference following my win in camaiore i trained for a period at altitude where i stayed on stelvio passo pordoi and eira
3029838 like fanini knows well the temperatures in these last weeks have not consented to training of more than a few hours a day

3029845 school is tuesday i do all this first then i go to the retail stores if i have to
3029846 im getting clothes for next year when she goes to kindergarten
3029847 weve had growth every year and this year is no different
3029848 people are looking to us to save money this year people who are coming in are buying more were expanding our racks to accommodate more inventory
3029849 the kids say that they can get three times as many clothes as retail for the same money thats the difference between a top and a whole outfit
3029850 between resale shops and goodwill and ebay my daughter is set n then i usually hand the clothes over to my neightbor so even the used clothes i buy get new life after my daughter grows out of them
3029851 resale shops goodwill salvation army etc these places are great i always thought of it as a treasure hunt that gives me the opportunity to be really creative
3029852 i think the school has a lot to offer and location was another bonus to it

3029855 i dont know if this is commin but i think i would almost like to go there and redshirt
3029856 that would give me more time to fit in with the guys and understand the offense more it would buy me some time to comeback and play the next year
3029857 i know with the new focus of nsp that we can and will be even more active in influencing future legislative decisions
3029858 ive been proud to be associated with this association and the great people who are its members and leaders
3029859 i see these winners and what they share with the industry and how they are successful in their operations as being teachers for the rest of us and helping to make the rest of us successful as we go back to our own farms
3029860 the peanut profitability award truly gives a whole farm picture of the peanut production on these growers farms
3029861 we look at both the variable and fixed costs and whenever we look at both components of cost it takes a while for these farmers and perhaps their wives to compile all of the information required
3029862 from this we decide the winners whoever has the lowest per unit cost of production
3029863 we dont look at high yields in single small plots but we take into account the overall profitability of the peanut enterprise
3029864 since its inception in 2000 this awards program has honored 27 deserving growers from throughout the southeast virginia carolina and southwest regions of the united states
3029865 each class of winners continues to impress with their innovative technologies and creativity in improving bottom line profits
