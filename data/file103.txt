1030165 these stocks have been beaten down pretty badly and now look particularly appealing
1030166 but the company subsequently suffered along with its customers in the communications and technology sectors
1030167 however giants are not particularly nimble and citicorp has struggled in the new credit environment that began a year ago the new management team will probably divest many businesses but they have a good core on which to rebuild
1030168 management has been quick to react laying off workers and shutting down plants we think the brand is strong enough to survive and so does legendary investor kirk kerkorian who has been buying ford shares as they drop

1030175 a new management team is aggressively pursuing new marketing schemes as well new technology such as wimax if results dont improve some or all of the company could be sold
1030176 the company services some 60 million local phone lines 15 million broadband subscribers and 71 million wireless customers

1030194 the attack on the indian embassy in kabul was an attack on the friendship between india and afghanistan president hamid karzais presence today conveys a befitting response to that attack

1030228 und gegen tottenham war dies in weiten teilen auch der fall
1030229 das ergebnis ist richtig fies wenn man das spiel gesehen hat kann man es aber richtig einordnen
1030230 tottenham ist eine europ ische spitzenmannschaft in vielen situationen haben wir ihr richtige probleme bereitet
1030231 richtig gut gefallen wie wir auf das geduldige spiel des gegners reagiert haben wir sind kompakt geblieben bis die m glichkeit bestand b lle zu erobern
1030232 nach einer viertelstunde waren wir dominant haben uns gute torchancen herausgearbeitet diese aber leider nicht genutzt
1030233 wir haben da eine berzahlsituation hergestellt ohne wirklich zu stechen
1030234 der junge hat ja nicht umsonst bei barcelona gekickt und ist f r nicht gerade wenig geld nach england gegangen

1030239 cleaning sprays especially air fresheners furniture cleaners and glass cleaners had a particularly strong effect the risk of developing asthma increased with the frequency of cleaning and number of different sprays used but on average was 30 to 50 percent higher in people regularly exposed to cleaning sprays than in others
1030240 cleaning sprays for sale in all supermarkets are not harmless and their use may involve serious health risks
1030241 nevertheless from the perspective of precaution we may recommend to use sprays only when really necessary in most cases it is possible to replace the spray by non spray cleaning liquids and to do the cleaning properly if sprays are used people can protect themselves by opening windows avoiding the application near the breathing zone and by using masks or other types of personal respiratory protection
1030242 cleaning compounds are generally just tested to make sure that they dont kill people or cause cancer
1030243 but these products may not be safe for asthmatics to breathe in and if its not safe for asthmatics its probably not safe for anyone else
1030244 switch to liquid cleaning products rather than aerosols if theres any difference in cleaning its a small sacrifice to be made in terms of protecting your respiratory health

1030385 colly and kp put us right in the game yesterday batting here on a fourth innings pitch will be difficult hopefully we can pressure on the sa batsmen although the pitch is holding up quite well there is some slight turn and skiddiness on it though
1030386 the advantage is still with us its a batting wicket we didnt bowl as well as we could but due respect to paul collingwood who took his chance well spinners need overs and i hope to get a few under my belt by the end of the match

1030388 is there an atmosphere of expectation in the ground this morning
1030389 for 15 minutes yesterday evening as the crowd bayed and adrenaline pumped a days cricket that had carried a dull inevitability about it was stripped down to bare knuckle fighting a gladiatorial contest between a great batsman and a colossal fast bowler and at the end it was andrew flintoff who almost single handedly had pulled his side back from the brink to a position from which if they can draw further strength from his deeds they may go on to win a match that after the first day had seemed doomed

1030396 in the six series since vaughan came back as captain england have already lost series against india and sri lanka and are well behind in this one against south africa they have beaten west indies and twice new zealand this is the equivalent of kicking sand in the face of the seven stone weaklings and then being buried up to your neck in the stuff when the bigger boys arrive
1030397 there were single figure scores for two people michael vaughan and collingwood who needed the runs the most
1030398 if england lose the series here as must now be a distinct possibility they will at least have a free hand when it comes to picking the side for the oval a few orthodoxies may have to be challenged and the starting point should be to restore flintoff to his rightful place at no6 time in the middle has always been the key to the big mans batting when he first comes back he seems ungainly and uncoordinated as if struggling to balance his gargantuan frame but with a couple of decent innings behind him his sheer size becomes an advantage the bat starts to look like a toothpick in his hands and the stumps seem dauntingly small

1030402 im hopeful that once we work this out it will lead to continued efficient use of state resources to deliver nursing education
1030403 we had support from nursing homes the ummc division of geriatrics the ummc department of psychiatry and human behavior and the mississippi department of mental health and the schools have been wonderful in wanting to do this
1030404 this effort is a great example of leaders coming together to meet health needs in our state nursing education leaders continue to provide a wonderful example of collaboration to other health care leaders in our state
1030405 with our states limited resources and with small numbers of students interested in these specialized advanced practice nursing clinical tracks we needed to combine our efforts to have all five programs offer these courses through their curricula and have one school teach them via distance learning technologies
1030406 the schools and the health resources service administration agreed and we all are winners especially our older adults and persons with mental health problems
1030407 the neat thing about this concept of an educational consortium is that it may apply to other specialized advanced practice nursing roles such as pediatrics and womens health

1030481 its not like anybody feels that any of those guys being mentioned in either party has to get it
1030482 maybe its hindsight playing tricks on me but it looks like the short lists in some years past contained people of greater stature
1030483 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly

1030490 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1030491 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1030492 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1030493 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1030494 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1030495 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1030496 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1030497 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1030498 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1030499 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1030500 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1030501 the message that needs to be communicated to these people is your problem is not global warming
1030502 your problem is not global warming your problem is your nuts
1030503 theyre going to the gore movie an inconvenient truth and being fed all this its ridiculous
1030504 well look back on all of this in 10 or 15 years and realise how foolish it was
1030505 the human impact on the atmosphere is simply too small to have a major effect on global temperatures
1030506 it bothers me that my fellow scientists are not speaking out against something they know is wrong
1030507 but they also know that theyd never get any grants if they spoke out i dont care about grants
1030508 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
1030509 human rights activists everywhere to condemn this violation of mr juarezs civil rights child rape is one of the basic civil rights guaranteed by the un civil rights commission
1030510 the united states our future colony refuses to recognize that child rape is an important part of our superior mexican culture
1030511 mr juarez is missing work at the factory farm of one of my big campaign contributors so i have asked president bush to pardon him so he can get back to work where he belongs he will be whipped for missing work while he was fooling around with that girl
1030512 because we say so since we duke professors are smarter than anyone we know
1030513 mr juarez is doing the kind of raping that americans wont do we have many 10 year old girls in the us but not enough skilled us rapists my proposed legislation will grant mr juarez full citizenship upon payment of a fine of 50 00 payable to the republican national congressional committee which desperately needs the money if mr juarez doesnt have enough money to pay the fine he should go rob someone
1030514 if she had taken the ride in my car that i offered her she would not have been home to be raped by this future democrat voter we offer him sanctuary in massatwochits hic
1030515 the girls family didnt buy carbon rights i bought from a chinese farmer who promised not to burn a million tons of coal this year so there was a cyclone which caused this rape
1030516 conservatives say that we just need to focus on maintaining free markets and let everything sort itself out through the miracle of the invisible hand but the political tide is turning against unfettered free markets and toward greater regulation
1030517 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
1030518 we talk about senator clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well in a role that is in many ways more powerful than the president
1030519 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1030520 there is significant support among top mccain advisers that he make a transformative pick who would change the republican party someone who would appeal to moderate republicans and democrats this pick would be someone who like mccain has taken the unpopular stands made the hard calls and stood firm on principle a person who fills that bill these advisers say is joe lieberman
1030521 you know something the republicans dont want to win this election they dont mccain may want to win but these people around him that are giving him this advice they must not want to win this election
1030522 there is a reason the american people the past 100 years elevated only two sitting senators into the white house jfk and warren harding its because they believe most senators adept at compulsive compromise have no political compass and will sell them out
1030523 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
1030524 ten to 15 years from now every single new building will be powered by fuel cells its the magic bullet until we get fusion power going
1030525 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1030526 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1030527 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin

1030530 and yet few politicians have seemed inclined to address solutions particularly if those solutions involve a modest individual sacrifice
1030531 since taking steps to make his home more environmentally friendly last june gore devours an average of 17 768 kwh per month 1 638 kwh more energy per month than the year before the renovations by comparison the average american household consumes 11 040 kwh in an entire year according to the energy information administration the cost of gores electric bills over the past year topped 16 533
1030532 water infiltrating the concrete slabs freezes and then thaws weakening the concrete and rusting the steel
1030533 colorado obama 47 mccain 45 virginia obama 47 mccain 46 missouri obama 45 mccain 47
1030534 alabama too close to call arkansas too close to call
1030535 why is it that barack obama cant consistently overshoot 50 and john mccain cant comfortably crack 45 in the national polls
1030536 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1030537 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
1030538 should we ignore gore or put him in charge hes an absurd extremist says mark davis the planet does not need saving the climate is not in crisis
1030539 options fade for failing schools outside managers lack of interest in texas has forced campus closures
1030540 the conrad foundation is based on petes history of innovation and entrepreneurship
1030541 we believe that ultimately it will offer a platform to encourage students to explore entrepreneurship while creating innovative solutions to important issues that face our world and their future
1030542 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1030543 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1030544 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1030545 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1030546 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1030547 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1030548 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1030549 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1030550 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1030551 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1030552 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1030553 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1030554 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1030555 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1030556 surrender of personal excellence and community value in the mere accumulation of material things it measures neither our wit nor our wisdom and can tell us everything about america except why were proud to be americans
1030557 fancy farm represents something very special in the american political tradition
1030558 isnt it remarkable that a community like this one for 112 years has been able to play a key role in shaping the future of kentucky and sometimes the future of this nation
1030559 every state is important to john mccain but there are other states where hes going to have to be
1030560 i would love to see him come to kentucky i really would during this election and i hope he will
1030561 but you dont have to be a mental giant to look at the map and see that there are more fruitful opportunities in terms of winning the election
1030562 its the changing nature of the south and southern border states which has not been favorable to democrats and the movement of white conservative democrats to the republican party
1030563 i wouldnt put kentucky or tennessee out there with utah and the really strong overwhelmingly republican states but at least with presidential politics democrats will struggle in those states
1030564 there might be a give of one or two points but i think for the long term we have consistently led by double digits for some time for kentucky i dont see that narrowing to single digits
1030565 when i ran for u s senate in 04 we werent on that map either before fancy farm i think i was behind somewhere around 27 points so no one was looking at kentucky
1030566 there are a lot of things that can happen between fancy farm and november
1030567 if it really goes on the final album i bet itll be a smash hit its kind of britney fighting with a voice inside her and damn its a huge fight with an aggressive and uptime instrumental and be ready
1030568 you took my innocence away you had invited me to play with my own dreams you made me go this way but now i dont care cause its my time and ill put you underground
1030569 we can see the return of britney spears little by little she is really getting back and working hard shes amazing

1030572 theres no one definition of forgiveness but in general forgiveness is a decision to let go of resentments and thoughts of revenge forgiveness is the act of untying yourself from thoughts and feelings that bind you to the offense committed against you this can reduce the power these feelings otherwise have over you so that you can live a freer and happier life in the present

1030582 all over this country people are asking whether or not george bush is smart enough to be president of the united states
1030583 does anyone in america doubt that kerry has a higher iq than bush im sure the candidates sats and college transcripts would put kerry far ahead
1030584 i dont know how theyve done it because my record is not public
1030585 i must have been drinking the night before i took that military aptitude test
1030586 once you settle for a ronald reagan then its easy to settle for a george bush and once you settle for a george bush then its real easy to settle for bush ii you know this should be evolution instead its devolution whats next
1030587 all of us are ignorant of many things its just that the liberal here thinkss he knows what the conservative is ignorant of
1030588 small c conservatives are smeared as stupid by liberals because they respect the values of western civilisation
1030589 a few months later another study emerged demonstrating that the average iq of states that had voted for gore was much higher than those that went for bush connecticut was given an average iq of 113 while conservative utah scored an 87 again barely above retarded according to these numbers the 16 smartest states all went for kerry while the 26 dumbest went for bush
1030590 liberals believe in free speech individual liberty religious freedom the right to make a living
1030591 the worst thing you could do is raise peoples payroll taxes my god
1030592 on social security he sen obama wants to raise social security taxes i am opposed to raising taxes on social security i want to fix the system without raising taxes
1030593 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1030594 i had just come out of the cotton fields and corn fields
1030595 i was on welfare with my family and i hated welfare i got angry and upset and told them i wanted to go to work
1030596 we wanted better health care shoes and clothing i felt during the years of my life working in the cotton field they owed me that i just got angry went from door to door we pulled together a few hundred women
1030597 we started marching on the welfare department demanding what we wanted and needed it was about 6 000 people
1030598 the police came and arrested us we had to do something to call attention to our agenda of wanting jobs and wanting to get away from welfare
1030599 i feel good about the honor i am grateful because i earned it i worked for it and i do it from the cotton fields to the bright street of las vegas earned that
1030600 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
1030601 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1030602 we talk about new york sen hillary clinton and her inspiration to millions of americans speaker pelosi has been an inspiration as well
1030603 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1030604 but i again want to emphasize my respect for the former vice presidents leadership on this issue and his continuous leadership and i am in no way trying to get into a fight with him
1030605 mccain is going to be just like obama mccain is a socialist and will pick nancy pelosi as his vp because he hates conservatives
1030606 i respect speaker pelosi i think shes one of the great american success stories
1030607 the need for math and science education and higher level thinking skills
1030608 the capital costs of wind and solar are terrifying to contemplate
1030609 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1030610 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1030611 i had other priorities in the 60s than military service
1030612 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex
1030613 the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
1030614 he is a great surrogate he is the top surrogate
1030615 we just found out last week that gore could come to the island
1030616 he asked gore to come and to be his surrogate
1030617 obama is the first presidential candidate to refuse federal funds in a general election
1030618 while mccain will get 85 million from the federal government for his campaign our goal is to raise 300 to 400 million
1030619 this will be the second or third fundraiser hell attend its pretty special gores a nobel prize winner an academy award winner and almost president
1030620 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1030621 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1030622 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1030623 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1030624 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1030625 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1030626 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1030627 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1030628 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1030629 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1030630 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1030631 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1030632 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night

1030635 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1030636 no one gets too old to learn a new way of being stupid
1030637 a politician with a troublesome reputation for trying to have it both ways
1030638 mr gore has a bit of a reputation for flip flopping and corner cutting
1030639 at least you know what i believe and where i stand
1030640 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
1030641 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
1030642 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
1030643 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
1030644 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
1030645 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
1030646 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
1030647 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
1030648 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
1030649 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
1030650 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
1030651 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
1030652 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
1030653 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
1030654 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
1030655 the bulk of his treatment is completed but he still gets chemo once a week his immune system is still repressed so right now his staff believes he wont go you never know with him though he might get up one day and decide he has to be there
1030656 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1030657 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1030658 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1030659 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1030660 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1030661 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1030662 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1030663 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1030664 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1030665 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1030666 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that
1030667 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
1030668 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1030669 i dont know what to do all these dead computers are making me blue
1030670 hp gateway or dell i always manage to blow them to hell
1030671 i wish this madness would end i dont have any more money to spend
1030672 i wish i could fix things with just a snap because i always buy pcs that are crap
1030673 i dont think that computers have hearts but i thought i heard it crying as mike scrapped it for parts
1030674 my cpus are melted blobs so maybe i should buy an apple from mr jobs
1030675 so a new pc i shall buy i just hope this one doesnt die
1030676 when we brought the organization to philadelphia and we did research with then television partner nbc polling people of the philadelphia area the awareness factor of arena football was about 1 5 percent
1030677 today i dont think theres a sports fan in philadelphia that hasnt at least heard of the philadelphia soul
1030678 i know that the players are happy i know that our fans are happy i know that the recipients of our philanthropy are happy
1030679 if this victory can clear the way and get rid of the curse that theyve had here for a number of years i hope it does
1030680 i hope the eagles now can win it the sixers mo cheeks and those guys can win it
1030681 its amazing how many people have texted or e mailed or called
1030682 coach tom coughlin from the giants andy reid bill belichick bob kraft doug flutie john elway al gore youd be surprised at the people who were glued to their tv sunday charlie weis
1030683 so many people that weve run into over the years that just had the best of wishes for what we just accomplished it was pretty cool
1030684 the quickest cheapest and best way to start using all this renewable energy is in the production of electricity in fact we can start right now using solar power wind power and geothermal power to make electricity for our homes and businesses
1030685 our struggling auto giants switch to the manufacture of plug in electric cars
1030686 new and replacement generating plants will cost about 560 billon through 2030 absent a significant expansion of energy efficiency programs or new climate initiatives
1030687 of course there are those who will tell us this cant be done
1030688 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1030689 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1030690 the driver of the town car that eventually whisked away gores wife and daughter left the engine idling and the ac cranking for 20 minutes before they finally left
1030691 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1030692 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1030693 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1030694 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1030695 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term
1030696 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1030697 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1030698 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1030699 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy
1030700 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
1030701 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1030702 scientists have confirmed that enough solar energy falls on the surface of the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of the entire worlds energy needs for a full year tapping just a small portion of this solar energy could provide all of the electricity america uses
1030703 enough wind power blows through the midwest corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of u s electricity demand
1030704 produce every kilowatt of electricity through wind sun and other earth friendly energy sources within 10 years this goal is achievable affordable and transformative
1030705 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
1030706 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
1030707 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
1030708 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1030709 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1030710 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1030711 the leading experts predict that we have less than 10 years to make dramatic changes in our global warming pollution lest we lose our ability to ever recover from this environmental crisis
1030712 eliminate carbon from the us electricity supply by 2018 or we are doomed
1030713 a challenge to all americans in every walk of life to our political leaders entrepreneurs innovators engineers and to every citizen
1030714 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront this issue as president next year
1030715 given how hot its been this summer can there be any doubt about global warming
1030716 does anyone have any reliable information from knowledgeable sources regarding how much oil is out there
1030717 on this anniversary of his first landmark testimony hansen once again appeared before congress today
1030718 i tell you the truth it is hard for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven again i tell you it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god
1030719 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
1030720 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
1030721 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
1030722 if hed been president we wouldnt have hadthese bush administration messes the past eight years
1030723 hes charismatic hes a strong orator he has a presencethat draws you in
1030724 al gore is one of the few public figureschallenging my generation to do anything hes inspirational
1030725 i dont think im very good at some of the things that themodern political system rewards and requires and ive foundother ways to make a difference and to serve the publicinterests
1030726 hebecame a star by rising above politics with his passion for theenvironment hes now international leader on an issue more andmore people care about there has been no more successfuldefeated presidential candidate
1030727 if the vice president says its do able i believe
1030728 its a strategy that willcreate millions of new jobs and one that will leave ourchildren a world that is cleaner and safer
1030729 it cannot be the basis of a soundenergy policy by any responsible official in america it seemsto me maybe i am wrong but i dont think so
1030730 you win some you lose some and then theres that little known third category
1030731 living like ed a guide to the eco friendly life
1030732 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
1030733 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
1030734 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
1030735 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
1030736 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1030737 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1030738 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1030739 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1030740 the survival of the united states of america as we know it is at risk
1030741 the answer is to end our reliance on carbon based fuels
1030742 this is an investment that will pay itself back many times over
1030743 its an expensive investment but not compared to the rising cost of continuing to invest in fossil fuels
1030744 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer
1030745 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
1030746 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
1030747 bridging the worlds of environmentalism finance technology and politics together mr gore is ideally suited to speak to this audience of innovators striving to integrate green building practices and leading edge technology into the 21st century in a way that is both smart and sustainable
1030748 a debut album this powerful doesnt come along very often probably even less often from a folkie like arkansas resident mike blackwell but come back to me hits all the right notes much of the credit probably should go to producer emily kaitz who seemed to know the perfect treatment for each song but the melodies that blackwell created certainly made kaitzs job that much easier its a stirring album of beautiful songs that will break your heart and give you hope at the same time
1030749 some content will appeal to geeks some who are cool some who are geeky cool
1030750 its clear that apple has complete control over what you install on your iphone or ipod touch
1030751 its not likely to happen but if someones talking about it then its a little closer to reality
1030752 well see what happens when we get further along in development of the new doom game and theres more buzz and we share more about what the game will be about
1030753 my dad made me realize what things are really worth
1030754 just coming to america there are so many things it makes me really appreciate
1030755 i used that to kind of motivate myself and see how hard people work and how proud people are to represent their country
1030756 from that point on i was like man i want to go to the olympics
1030757 the best thing that could happen for me is winning the gold for the united states
1030758 being an american is not something im going to take lightly when i took that oath i meant every piece of it
1030759 when i told them i was going to run they were actually kind of mad at me like what are you doing
1030760 but when they noticed where this could take me they changed they became totally supportive
1030761 this is very special running tonight now im part of the usa going to beijing im very excited
1030762 i have different roots leo has different roots bernard has different roots but now our roots are in america and this is where we all come together and say hey lets all go out there and represent our country
1030763 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
1030764 despite such a clear demonstration of the power of integrating search and offline channels surprisingly the strategy has yet to gain widespread adoption unfortunately by failing to integrate their efforts with offline search marketers are essentially ignoring the very channels that drive users to search
1030765 engaged in a willful and egregious pattern of concerted and consistent deception
1030766 when carnegie donates his accumulated wealth to public good the capitalist self negates himself as the mere personification of capital and its reproduction circulation his life acquires meaning
1030767 both an inividuals isolation and his immersion in a crowd exclude intersubjectivity proper the encounter with an other
1030768 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
1030769 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
1030770 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
1030771 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help

1030775 10 bad words is okay but 11 or more is sinful
1030776 will any of the content of this movie negatively impact my relationship with god my wife my kids or my friends
1030777 is there content in this movie that is gratuitously exploitative or unnecessarily explicit
1030778 originally the characters were to use period slang and swear words
1030779 recognizing the pervasiveness and influence of pop culture requires us to accept that we live in a new day it is not the industrial age it is not the modern generation we live squarely in the middle of a media driven entertainment crazed world people around us are not only watching and listening they are actually shaping their values through the movies books songs and tv shows that fill their world we can get angry about that we can throw a tantrum sign a petition and support a boycott thats all fine and dandy but it wont change the facts the influence of pop culture is here and it is here to stay
1030780 popular culture with its assumptions of a mass audience once provided at least the illusion of common ground its foundation was a large but essentially knowable range of movies music tv shows and fads that most people were assumed to be familiar with but that foundation is buckling under the sheer weight of all the things that now qualify as pop culture and all the new technologies that deliver them to finely calibrated consumer niches today the national water cooler bubbles with competing monologues rather than inclusive dialogues
1030781 either we are growing in numbers or we are growing in our faith it cant be both either we are having an impact on the community or we are helping believers mature it cant be both either we are attractional or we are missional it cant be both

1030791 her first words were that she was very happy to see very nice people she was very pleased about that she was ecstatic

1030796 he seemed like a person who was happy to have a job was committed to doing it well and didnt stand out in any way in terms of having anger issues or having any other issues
1030797 we are very thorough in our assessments and there was nothing we could have foreseen
1030798 any ancient deeply rooted autonomous culture especially if it is spread on a wide part of the earths surface constitutes an autonomous world full of riddles and surprises to western thinking
1030799 for one thousand years russia has belonged to such a category
1030800 a great writer is so to speak a secret government in his country
1030801 a man sprouts a tumor and dies how then can a country live that has sprouted camps and exile
1030802 suddenly all the professors and engineers turned out to be saboteurs and they believed it or all of lenins old guard were vile renegades and they believed it suddenly all their friends and acquaintances were enemies of the people and they believed it
1030803 the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of russian literature
1030804 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
1030805 wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension
1030806 exile from his great theme stalinism and the gulag had exposed his major weaknesses
1030807 the whole truth about russia until they shut my mouth like before
1030808 understood the subtlety sensitivity and kindheartedness of the jewish character
1030809 we need to be better so we need to go more slowly
1030810 well there comes time when my mentor and i get to compete and i guess thats whats going to happen
1030811 this isnt going to be easy its going to be a dogfight and i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be and let coach decide from there
1030812 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate
1030813 the most beautiful woman of her generation accessible but edgy with an appeal which will extend beyond fashion and will rock the entire world to its very foundations
1030814 she is the epitome of modern woman a new beauty who has the discipline of not eating she has the narrowest hips i have ever seen on a woman she is very nearly the most beautiful woman who has ever lived
1030815 my sculptures have been on show in a couple of galleries in london and im sure that like if i wasnt known for being a model i wouldve got more recognition for them thats what drives me though i adore working only last week i put in three hours overseeing the design of some printed pillowcases for liberty i was really like out of the zone it was absolutely gruelling and i almost felt as if i was losing my mind a couple of times but i felt this kind of sense of achievement afterwards my minds always on the go ive also got this capsule range of hair slides available at harrods they start at 85 because im mindful of the fact that ordinary people wouldnt be able to buy one of my sculptures but its still a way for them to sort of have a part of me i love ordinary people only this morning i saw this sort of bulgariany peasant woman begging in the street and i really empathised with her like shes hungry and i know how that feels because i have to go without food during fashion campaigns
1030816 its a fun thing with charlie and we shag a lot and take coke together and that sort of thing but im getting a bit older now and theres a very narrow shelf life for a model
1030817 no one is searching for the insert esoteric service i offer therefore seo wont work for me
1030818 i think its a fitting contribution by the club to retire the shirt in tribute to bobby moore i am honoured to be the last player to wear the number six i will miss it but im glad it is being retired in honour of such a fantastic player and a true club legend
1030819 the legendary number six shirt is synonymous with bobby and his triumpant and illustrious footballing career
1030820 its retirement signifies deep respect affection and admiration for all that bobby achieved and all he represented in this marvellous game of ours thank you west ham

1030864 when do i tell the assessor its only my third d1 mens center
1030865 see this is why i dont listen to any of you
1030866 so how do you treat a game when both teams are whining from the very first minute
1030867 i dont have the mental references to put this into perspective for this level
1030868 and does that amount of talk back affect your game
1030869 aw shit i dont know thats why youre there to tell me if it is
1030870 i saw a lot of smiling from you you had a good presence and it was that presence that kept the game in control you heard their whines acknowledged it and moved on
1030871 our study found that several complementary methods types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
1030872 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various complementary methods types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread
1030873 could be the result of the limited power of the latter analysis to detect a difference an alternative explanation however is a drug interaction mediated by rifampicin during the lead in dosing phase of nevirapine
1030874 given the continued reliance on nevirapine containing art regimens in africa together with the important role tuberculosis services play as an entry point for art further prospective studies exploring this outcome are warranted one of the most striking aspects of our study was the demonstration that 40 percent of patients starting art in recent years have concurrent tuberculosis underscoring the public health importance of improving affordable treatment options for patients infected with hiv and tuberculosis in this setting
1030875 these results will help us to better understand how the disease was transmitted on those days and supports the initial findings of our investigation
1030876 it is important for us to remember that this outbreak is not the result of any actions on the part of the patients but it is the result of unsafe practices by the staff of these clinics
1030877 patients are providing us with important information about their procedures their test results and health status the registry will allow us to identify additional cases or exposures at either clinic
1030878 since the beginning of the hiv aids epidemic the rate of aids diagnosis for hispanics latinos has continuously increased at disproportionate rates
1030879 the rate of progression of the disease among our own hispanic community underscores the need for early testing we encourage everyone to know your status by getting tested getting treated and getting educated about hiv aids in order to stop the devastation to our communities
1030880 given concerns about potential harmful effects and lack of evidence proving that these medications are effective in young children the fact that one in ten u s children is using one of these medications is striking
1030881 the actual person teaching makes a difference in how students learn when there is a good relationship that really facilitates learning and motivation and we found that in almost every area the regular classroom teachers were more effective they were better
1030882 the relationship between the teacher and the student particularly during adolescence is very important it was easier for the kids to talk about personal stuff with someone they knew it was easier for them to absorb the material and become more interested in what they were talking about with their regular teacher in the classroom
1030883 when you have kids who simply memorize material for the test and two weeks later dont remember any of it youre not getting anywhere but if you can get the kids to care and learn because they think its important thats something that will last a lifetime
1030884 students who had a sexual partner were more likely to say that there was class discussion going on with the regular teacher than those taught by the outside person these kids were more likely to feel like there was discussion of these issues rather than just the teacher lecturing to them
1030885 school is the absolute best way to get information out to adolescents no matter who is teaching the important thing is getting the teacher to make a connection if the teacher can make the right connection with one kid youve saved one person from getting hiv youve saved one persons life
1030886 children who experience hostility abuse physical discipline and other aggressive behaviors by their parents are more likely to model that behavior in their peer relationships
1030887 children learn from their parents how to behave and interact with others
1030888 so if theyre learning about aggression and angry words at home they will tend to use these behaviors as coping mechanisms when they interact with their peers
1030889 has served as one of the primary contributors to its persistence and severity

1030898 we showed that the patients who got the real drug rather than placebo were less likely to relapse to drinking or if they relapsed it was later
1030899 in other words gabapentin prevented and delayed relapse meanwhile patients reported sleeping better in both the treatment and placebo groups which may be due to the gabapentin in the first group and the resumption of drinking in the other
1030900 there may be some underlying chemical changes in the brain that prompt alcoholics to report more insomnia as a co existing condition than non alcoholics
1030901 a possible explanation of these new findings is that the gabapentin might decrease the insomnia initially and the patient may not need or crave alcohol as a treatment for the insomnia were also looking into other factors that may have an effect on the neurochemistry of the brain and see how they could impact recovery and sleep
1030902 these results raise more questions for us to explore including the potential impact of gabapentin on people who are in recovery from alcohol dependence but do not report insomnia

1030927 we are disappointed that we have not yet received a response from iran
1030928 we agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1030929 the incentives package contained everything iran needed to pursue a modern civil nuclear power program which irans leaders claim is their aim the pressure on iran to comply with the demands of the international community and its u n security council obligations will only grow

1030931 you have taxpayers subsidizing the risk takers mortgage lenders which i find unacceptable
1030932 the more i think back the more reasons i think of that i oppose this on
1030933 it actually undoes some of the risk lenders took when they loaned money to these people
1030934 the only way it will cost the taxpayers money will be if the renegotiated mortgages are defaulted on
1030935 as the homes are foreclosed on then no one pays property taxes
1030936 if you dont do this bill to keep homes out of foreclosure the property taxes for everyone else will rise to make up for it the loss of revenue
1030937 my point is theres no loss of taxes under this bill
1030938 while the term bailout has some validity it is not a bailout as in terms of bear stern or even an fdic federal deposit insurance corporation buyout

1030954 beverly hills cop still the leader with 234 8 million
1030955 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
1030956 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
1030957 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers ferrell said
1030958 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit

1030967 ive had this set for about four years none of the bubbles have dried up and it is deadly accurate at leveling the laser measuring device isnt as reliable however i dont use these tools very often but they save me a lot of time and hassle when i do
1030968 the product has an excellent look and its ok for indoor purposes but when it comes to outdoors projects which is what i need it for the level is worthless can not see the laser line in day time i feel that ive wasted my money
1030969 i recived this as a gift and did not use it for some time when i did the level was dry the salesperson said it was out of warranty and could do nothing the parts center had no repair kit for it or parts now i have a useless laser levler i am very disappointed with this equipment and craftman
1030970 i received laser level last year for fathers day i didnt have a project right then so it sat on the shelf for a year i finally had a project to useit set it nice and leve according to the bubbles but the line didnt look level so i grabbed the old fashion level and sure enough the line is off by about 2 degrees for both vertical and horizontal looked in the instructions to see if there is any adjustment and this is not makes the it kind of pointless

1030985 furthermore plans unless specifically designated for tethering usage cannot be used for any applications that tether the device through use of including without limitation connection kits other phone pda to computer accessories bluetooth or any other wireless technology to personal computers including without limitation laptops or other equipment for any purpose
1030986 the app may not violate a terms of service agreement of a different iphone carrier but in the us it does violate at amp ts tos
1030987 apple has separate app stores for the countries it looks like its an apple up selling it in the us app store
1030988 at the very least we hope apple will allow it to be used in countries where the provider does permit tethering
1030989 if they had gone into kindergarten they would have been the youngest kids in the class
1030990 looking back on it we think it was a terrifically wise move because theyre confident kids theyre good students theyre popular
1030991 and i think much of that is attributed to their feeling good about themselves in the classroom setting
1030992 there are tons of studies that show that when kids are older theyre able to handle more complicated situations more effectively
1030993 my goal in terms of high school drop out rate is that these children do not get humiliated in the younger grades so that education is looked upon by them as something of a high value
1030994 right and its bad if kids test well tests better feeling better about himself or herself

1030997 i think this new biological strand of highly cellulosic sugar cane once that develops as a renewable source of energy i think thats going to be the next cotton crop for the region around memphis
1030998 one thing were going to do for sure is focus attention and tax credits on solar and wind energy with sharp already having a major role in solar energy that can be a big focus for memphis
1030999 the other thing i think we need to focus on for memphis is the now commercialized cellulosic ethanol production
1031000 and a refinery can be built east of memphis that will benefit from that and be a boon to the city especially with the river and pipelines and the potential for shipping ethanol

1031042 we were prepared to welcome proposals for a long term relationship with a new substantial investor to help establish west brom as a successful premier league club
1031043 we said we would shut the door on this at the end of july because we did not want anything off the pitch impacting on the new season
1031044 there has been some initial contact from a few third parties but we have received no firm proposals whatsoever
1031045 we proactively invited a new investor with substantial resources to contact the club
1031046 although no one has come forward the club have been planning more ambitiously and aggressively than ever before for the new season and we are very much looking forward to once again competing in the premier league

1031053 kevin davies is someone we put a bid in for but bolton have made it quite clear he is not for sale

1031076 the first neutrons met all of our technical performance predictions and creating them is a significant milestone in the life of the facility and in the completion of the project
1031077 the isis second target station builds on the success and expertise we have developed over the past 20 years at isis and allows us to move further into the areas of soft matter advanced materials and bioscience we will be carrying out fundamental research that will shape the technological advances of tomorrow
1031078 this is an incredible technical achievement by our staff and demonstrates how everyone can pull together and enable stfc to deliver massive science projects that underpin the long term future of science and innovation in the uk
1031079 im very proud of every single person who has played a part in getting the isis second target station project through to this very important milestone
1031080 this is tremendous news for the science community both in the uk and much further afield
1031081 the isis second target station will open research into new types of materials that has not been previously possible at isis and we look forward to a world of new science flowing from the new instrument suite
1031082 this is a remarkable achievement by the isis team and adds an exciting new dimension to the capabilities of the european neutron scattering toolkit
1031083 isis is the worlds leading spallation neutron facility and has performed world class outstanding science

1031088 in nearly every population of adult surgical patients either medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis reduces venous thromboembolism by approximately 70 if one assumes similar efficacy in pregnant women 5 of the 7 deaths from pulmonary embolism in women undergoing cesarean delivery would have been prevented if a policy of universal use of medical or mechanical thromboprophylaxis for patients undergoing cesarean had been in place such a policy would reduce the mortality rate attributed causally to cesarean delivery to 0 9 100 000 or approximately 9 us deaths annually eliminating the statistical difference in deaths attributed to cesarean vs vaginal birth
1031089 it seems clear that the majority of maternal deaths in the united states are not preventable the most common preventable errors in preeclampsia management leading to maternal death involved inattention to blood pressure control and signs or symptoms of pulmonary edema those involving postpartum hemorrhage deaths were related to inadequate surgical hemostasis in all these cases more prompt attention to clinical signs of hemorrhage and associated hypovolemia would also have prevented death
1031090 we want to know can we look at landscape models in a predictive way and use those to inform us about natural populations and how they deliver pollinator services to crops
1031091 over half of the worlds native plants require animal pollinators and most of those are bees
1031092 native pollinators are serving as a backup plan for the honeybee
1031093 crucially our model is able to predict the behavior of bees in larger scale foraging environments where the foraging patches can be thought of as large fields of crops
1031094 its not just matrix of natural areas with agriculture mixed in but a patchwork quilt with animals using all of the areas in the landscape
1031095 the device could be used to detect frauds committed regarding the vintage year of the wine or the grape varieties used

1031097 ich habe keine ahnung wie ich unter solchen bedingungen trainieren soll und noch weniger wer meinen diskus nach dem werfen sauber manchen soll
1031098 habitat destruction is a major threat to biodiversity throughout the world
1031099 the caribbean is particularly vulnerable because it contains an unusually high percentage of endangered species and because these animals live on islands they have nowhere to go when they lose their habitat
1031100 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
1031101 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
1031102 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive
1031103 it is difficult to protect a species if you dont know it exists
1031104 pl tzlich kam der b r von rechts lief durch den bunker ber das fairway und verschwand im wald er war h chstens f nf meter von uns entfernt er war wohl hungrig und verfolgte eine f hrte

1031110 life is pain anyone who says different is selling something
1031111 weve got loads of plans were going to support it massively
1031112 content packs new objects new game modes all of this stuff could be done what were basically waiting to see is what the demand is for
1031113 we can do all of that stuff we will do all of that stuff but what order we do it in and how much weight we throw behind any of the different ideas that different people have got is totally down to what the community does
1031114 that really excites me because if people are loving the costumes we can crank them out if people are loving the levels and master classes weve got a slightly scarily long list of great ideas for ways to support the community and its just a matter of prioritising at this stage
1031115 i can definitely say that there will be content thats available to people free of charge im just not saying exactly what that content is going to be right now
1031116 i can also say that if theres any way we can reward the community well go there if people are clamouring for big chunks of content it would make total sense for us to do it were just exploring all options at this point sequels why not dlc yeah why not paid for content why not
1031117 some of this anthrax may and i emphasize may have come from iraq
1031118 i dont think you beat obama by saying that hes paris hilton
1031119 the more important thing is really to look at is he who he says he is is he really this great reformer
1031120 we are in a terrible economic crisis because lobbyists and oil companies have colluded to rip you off but dont worry president obama will right that wrong
1031121 oh and if you didnt notice the first time its bush and mccain that brought you this
1031122 a ver si resulta que al no estar determinado por los genes o conocimientos innatos soy m s libre que el resto de los animales tengo que empezar desde cero al contrario del pollito que sale disparado picoteando al nacer y claro me equivoco muchas veces soy m s infeliz porque soy m s libre
1031123 you know how tyra likes to do that stuff and shell get a lot of press off it
1031124 i feel like im still a teenager because im perpetually in high school
1031125 they were holding hands and very affectionate with each other
1031126 they were holding hands the entire night they werent hiding anything
1031127 one man asked me if i was prepared for a hostile takeover
1031128 they said i need to come to a place on sunday morning where i dont experience
1031129 we are the church together another book that looks at interracial churches says whites often say that church should transcend race
1031130 theyd say cant we just get along without talking about race all the time
1031131 people said that if jews greeks africans slaves men and women the huge divides of that time period could come together successfully there must be something to this religion
1031132 everyone understands the rules the lingo the mind set except you
1031133 it was invaluable but i didnt know it at the time
1031134 the fear there was people would think i was chinese
1031135 there would be a flood of all these asians coming in and what would we do then
1031136 if theres not any tension we probably havent done too well
1031137 if one group feels too comfortable weve probably neglected another group
1031138 they didnt want their kids involved in interracial dating and thats not just whites
1031139 as long as the top person the senior pastor is white power sort of resides with whites
1031140 but when that shifts it does something psychologically to people people usually leave
1031141 a black church sermon that could be understood as impassioned might be interpreted as angry and defensive by a white congregation
1031142 taking one dominant identity and forcing everyone to fit into it
1031143 when i look into his eyes i can see the love of jesus christ he and i have become friends
1031144 barbara was shocked that sherri would say she needs to be saved shes dumbfounded by the stupid things that keep coming out of sherris mouth
1031145 and after hearing what she said to a christian magazine word came back from barbara that she wants to boot her off the show
1031146 barbara thinks sherri has become far worse of a problem than star jones and rosies odonnel when they were on the show and thats saying a lot
1031147 barbara may first give her a chance to shape up before shipping her out
1031148 and if barbara does let sherri go expect a fun farewell with the whole gang saying only nice things about sherri in public

1031176 this amount was a final payment to end mr cherneys interference in mr deripaskas business mr deripaska denies that there was any agreement to pay further amounts to mr cherney
1031177 there is significant risk that mr cherney will not obtain in russia a trial unaffected by improper interference by state actors and that substantial justice may not be done
1031178 inherent in a trial in russia assassination arrest on trumped up charges and lack of a fair trial are sufficient to make england the forum in which the case can most suitably be tried
1031179 the u s appeal courts have found that russia is an adequate judicial forum despite various shortcomings judge clarke may also have drawn conclusions about o d s mr deripaskas credibility that were against the weight of the evidence a foreign defendant in this type of application is entitled to a scrupulously fair hearing
1031180 and we must warn you what you are about to hear is extremely graphic

1031185 we suffer together whether consciously or unconsciously but in our intervulnerability is our salvation because awareness of the mutuality of suffering impels us to search for ways to heal the whole rather than encase ourselves in a bubble of denial and impossible individualism
1031186 if chicos wants to sue then the german guy who came up with the hamburger and the italian guy who came up with the pizza should also sue
1031187 we know that we are playing a tough side and we are going to fight we take into consideration that chiefs have a bad record in this cup and we will use it to our advantage
1031188 the only advantage chiefs might have is that of fitness as they have been playing in tournaments but i have confidence that my charges will rise to the occasion
1031189 i have confidence in my players i urge supporters not to put the players under pressure they should rally behind the new players like they have been doing in the past and we will pull through
1031190 we are under no pressure against checkers it was our first competitive game and i do not believe we were as bad as people might think the fact that we did not concede against a team which has been doing well shows something
1031191 i have watched rollers play several times and they are good they are a side which can attack but their problem has always been in defence i understand that they have bought new defenders and we will surely test them at the weekend
1031192 we are not planning for individuals because that is not our style people have been asking me about the game and believe me i do not want to disappoint our supporters we will fight
1031193 we believe with the support of the government with the help of the international community we have the confidence and the ability to host a safe and secure olympic games

1031201 seit den 1960er jahren als ein tag im leben des iwan denissowitsch ver ffentlicht wurde waren die einstellungen zu solschenizyn sehr unterschiedlich und widerspr chlich
1031202 und es w re falsch zu glauben dass es nur um die konfrontation zwischen solschenizyn und der staatsf hrung der partei ging
1031203 das ph nomen solschenizyn hat das damalige schriftstellermilieu gespalten er hatte freunde die ihm selbstlos halfen aber auch viele gegner zu einem wesentlichen teil hat das schriftstellermilieu ihn abgesto en
1031204 auch nach seinem tod gibt es nun nicht blo rituelle phrasen sondern auch verschiedene meinungen ich glaube das ist nat rlich und normal denn jeder gro e mensch und solschenizyn ist ein solcher f r mich l st mit seiner m chtigkeit unterschiedliche reaktionen und gef hle aus

1031207 solschenizyn war einer der gr ten geister russlands aus dem 20 jahrhundert er der ein jahr nach der russischen revolution geboren wurde verk rperte die welt der dissidenten in den jahren des sowjetischen terrors

1031211 the bush administration and the president will be trying to keep this six party process on track but the process is a very fragile one and time is running out on the bush administration which somewhat ironically has come to regard the north korean negotiations as one of its most significant diplomatic successes
1031212 their response to the recent natural disaster was unwarranted at best and we urge the regime to free democracy advocate and nobel laureate aung san suu kyi
1031213 laura and i look forward to joining you for the olympics
1031214 the president and i have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position

1031225 everyone is an expert at something and teachstreet was designed to bridge the gap between those who have something to teach and those with a desire to learn
1031226 just because we stop going to school doesnt mean we dont want to continue to improve ourselves and learn new things teachstreet is about the act of discovery and helping both teachers and students make real world connections at the local level
1031227 my passion is teaching bharathanatyam dance an ancient form of classical south indian dance not finding ways to get more students so i love that teachstreet helps me fill my class schedule and allows me to spend more time doing what i want to be doing teaching

1031235 it shows that when people do these speeds along the roads they will be caught and taken before the courts
1031236 mr matanle should not have been exceeding 70mph so this shows blatant disregard for his own safety and that of other road users
1031237 we know that people like to ride their bikes fast but there are track days for that sort of thing the two year ban proves this will not be tolerated on public roads and should be a warning to other motorcyclists
1031238 motorcycle riders are a small percentage of the overall users of our roads but they account for something like 25 per cent of all fatalities
1031239 we did direct mail on the program to people who live in portage county some people dont always keep us apprised of their address
1031240 we had about same number eligible but less than 100 that signed up for the program and even less signed up for the first class
1031241 since this will be a series that will be shown everyday makikita natin dito lahat we will see what happens to the contestants not just while they are doing the stunts but also before and after the stunts malalaman natin yung mga takot nila and televiewers will be able to relate to them
1031242 may mga makikita tayong stunts na nagawa na sa fear factor na gagawin din sa pff hollywood in style pero pinoy ang gagawa may mga stunts naman na galing din sa south america they are all safe naman we are going there to ensure the safety of the stunts
1031243 the contestants came from diverse backgrounds we believe that the viewers will be able to identify with each one of the contestants ang mga pinoy kasi matatapang by nature tinignan lang namin yung contestant kung paano siya mag react sa fear at paano nila io overcome yung fear na yun
1031244 pinoy fear factor will give us an entertainment value of a reality action packed show i believe the filipinos are ready for this kind of show ratings wise maganda naman yung pagtanggap ng mga pilipino sa fear factor

1031247 as sir salman waits to arise we have a big row about whether a writer who few really read should have a title that few really care about sometimes it really does feel as if we are living in far far away land
1031248 this decision does not surprise us i personally consider it a normal decision by a country that contributed in the establishment of the zionist entity a country that played a major role in uprooting the palestinians from their lands a country that made the belford promise a country that honored the author who made the ugliest accusations ever to prophet mohammed who are the fighters of the islamic resistance compared with our prophet the decision is a normal one and i believe it might have come too late
1031249 the timing is sketchy especially when the west as well as the arab world in interested in the swap deal

1031278 we welcome the opportunity to show how our jointly produced radio serial drama con el viento al favor with the wind in my sails effectively engaged local communities in 6 peruvian provinces to make a real difference in the fight against hiv aids
1031279 this is the typical family novella it draws the audience into the story draws out their opinions and invites them to reflect about the consequences of the characters choices

1031306 the judges opinion is all that matters now isnt it
1031307 as plaintiff is proceeding pro se and is ostensibly neither an attorney nor well versed in the law and procedure involved in the pursuit of his claim this court recommends that he seek counsel before proceeding further in what appears to be a complex action
1031308 ive read rico ray does not understand the law at all
1031309 nor does plaintiff cite to any law to support his legal assertion that he is entitled to a tro rather plaintiff offers one mere conclusory statement that he is likely to prevail on the merits of his claim and that the continued publication of the rayfaq website will cause irreparable harm to plaintiff not limited to damage to his reputation employment and investment prospects without more than mere conclusions this court cannot consider and weigh the factors necessary for the issuance of a tro accordingly plaintiffs motion for temporary injunctive relief is denied
1031310 specifically plaintiffs excuse that he did not learn of this courts ruling for two weeks on his ifp motion is disingenuous according to this courts docket report plaintiffs ifp motion was filed on september 10 2002 decided on september 12 2002 and the order mailed to him on september 16 2002 on september 18 2002 just eight 8 days after plaintiff filed his ifp motion plaintiff submitted his 150 00 filing fee to the clerk of court presumably in response to this courts denial of his ifp motion plaintiff misrepresents the alleged delay as the docket report clearly indicates that he knew of the decision prior to the passage of two weeks time
1031311 notwithstanding the force of authority requiring personal service under rule 45 plaintiff has not demonstrated that he has expended any effort whatsoever to identify the defendants or to serve the subpoenas upon the isps and thus his assertion that the costs are prohibitive and beyond his means is mere speculation

1031319 up there it was hell during the descent beyond 8 000 meters 26 000 feet due to the altitude and the exhaustion i even fell asleep in the snow and when i woke up i could not figure out where i was

1031322 are holding up well and are very proud of gers achievement and are still in total shock in relation to the fact that he may not be coming back
1031323 you can see how for people who were exhausted it would have been nearly impossible for them to descend without the ropes

1031328 in our august issue antony worrall thompson suggested that the weed henbane was great in salads in fact henbane is very toxic and is a schedule iii poison under the medicines act please discount this suggestion antony is very sorry for causing confusion and had quite a different plant in mind
1031329 can only be sold in herbal medicines following a one to one consultation with a practitioner
1031330 its a close relative of deadly nightshade and is a very well recognised poisonous plant like most poisons it has medicinal properties it can be used to treat patients with pain affecting the urinary tubules such as kidney stones and for certain gut problems it acts as a sedative with analgesic properties
1031331 a good portion would probably cause significant gastrointestinal diffculties and a larger dose would be fatal if anyone has followed mr worrall thompsons advice they should dial 999 and prepare to have their stomach pumped
1031332 i was thinking of a wild plant with a similar name not this herb but of course ive ended up killing half the nation instead

1031337 there can be no certainty that any offer will ultimately be made for the company or as to the terms on which any such offer might be made
1031338 these are assets that could be of interest to the two large state companies so its difficult to imagine that just a chinese company or an indian for that matter could take it
1031339 it would be much easier for them sinopec or ongc to do it jointly with a large state company this could be one way to fund the deal it is becoming harder for foreign companies to work in russia
1031340 if sinopec has indeed entered the due diligence process late this ironically may give ongc more time to clear its bid it may also encourage other noc bidders to enter the fray e g knoc korea national oil corp of south korea

1031414 99 percent of the worlds potatoes are related to potatoes of chilean origin
1031415 99 percent are also genetically related to potatoes originating in peru in other words they coexisted potatoes will always carry genes from varieties found in chile and peru
1031416 i hope chauvinistic nationalism will be laid aside as it contributes nothing to scientific development and protection of the potato which is a multicultural and cross border resource
1031417 the state must register the variety to ensure recognition of the benefits and must also reward the communities of small farmer who originally cultivated it and have conserved it for years
1031418 potato growing on chilo is precarious production is mainly for subsistence and the areas planted are tending to shrink due to the high cost of fertiliser
1031419 the importance of native potatoes as a resource is greatly underestimated people generally eat improved varieties
1031420 our greatest need is training and regular technical advice in order to improve production
1031421 we are the worst affected within the potato production chain and also the most vulnerable to soaring food prices
1031422 while our countries waste time arguing about the origin of animal and plant species developed countries are using our germplasms to create new materials and claim property rights

1031522 ascianos security price has been trading at a significant discount to fair value during 2008 for a number of reasons including market fears over debt levels downgrades to guidance its failed brambles stake and uncertainty as to how asciano will fund growth
1031523 given all the noise around asciano many market participants have largely forgotten the strategic positioning and value of ascianos asset base and hence allowed the stock to trade down to levels well below fair value
1031524 quite simply asciano has the dominant market share of australias container trade is the dominant provider of container rail movements and dominant provider of coal and grain haulage in southeastern australia not to mention has a number of well positioned bulk port assets
1031525 the best chance weve learned is with a different city and given that were talking 20 to 30 years before we could do it again i think a lot will come down to how brisbane develops in terms of further infrastructure hotels and whatever by then
1031526 i couldnt and wouldnt say to the queensland government or the brisbane city council to go out and build a new swimming pool but infrastructure is important villages in the past have been around university sites for instance it would be smart to at least have somewhere in mind but certainly i wouldnt be counselling them to go building anything because what you build now would be outdated by then
1031527 my view is that this is something brisbane should throw its hat in the ring for
1031528 it is a 10 15 years thing and something we would have to work through
1031529 there are significant issues with brisbanes infrastructure apart from sporting infrastructure hotel roads public transport and water infrastructure needs would have to be addressed
1031530 im very positive about this and quite pleased that john coates has the confidence that brisbane could stage a future olympics
1031531 its very very expensive to build for an olympic games now because of the added security element

1031533 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1031534 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1031535 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1031536 simply put alan has been put on notice as of today
1031537 that without pre empting the outcome it is very likely they a breach would have an immediate and ultimate outcome on the termination of alans contract alan is very clear from this meeting that it will be a turning point in his career in either direction clear lines have been drawn in the sand
1031538 right now the way im feeling is that if we played a game right now against st kilda and the st kilda boys roughed him up and were into him at the first bounce im not too sure if id be over there to support him to tell you the truth youve done it you cop it
1031539 i know once i get to saturday night were definitely all in it together
1031540 i think he is still considering his position yes i do
1031541 the cartoonists who presented him as a hamlet like figure were at least right for a period he may have decided on this recent holiday i havent spoken to him since he returned it may well be that was a period of finally getting things together
1031542 yes that was certainly his mood on november 25th i cant point to a date that he changed his mind i think melbourne university press publisher louise adler had something to contribute to that because she persuaded him to write the book
1031543 and that gave him the opportunity to really do more than brood but to actually settle down and sort out his ideas so the book is a sorting out of ideas
1031544 look let me put it this way there are two views one is that i did these 12 years and thats an important episode of my life and now its time to move on that makes perfect sense rather than revisit the old battlegrounds the other view is that i still have so much more to contribute that i really ought to do it
1031545 theres a touch of that and theres touch of plain narrative a touch of apologia you know apologia is the wrong word its a fancy word for autobiography you apologise to god not to your colleagues
1031546 my own preference would be for him to stay on and defeat this dreadful government but i can well see the other point of view
1031547 she will support her husband shes a loyal wife in that sense not that she doesnt have views of her own she would say its after all his life and he has to live it if he goes back to canberra
1031548 its pretty well established you do a count of the votes and the support and you either expect to win and if you havent got the numbers you dont do it or you think there would be some advantage in splitting the party which was something that peter would never do between those two he was stymied the third thing being the prime ministers unyielding attitude
1031549 at the beginning peter was providing the autobiographical information and i was doing the writing

1031553 anything in the north isnt going to get there they obviously bought the cheapest water they could buy without caring where it came from
1031554 the government purposely purchased at fair market price a range of water types from a range of sources in order to best meet priority environmental needs
1031555 one quarter of the water entitlements purchased are high security and most of the remainder are general security
1031556 of real water in the medium to long term and they have made all their purchases with an eye firmly on ecological assets they can use that water for
1031557 dispels the public myth that the current environmental problems are being caused by farmers taking too much water
1031558 that will be diverted into the river murray in 2008 09 to enable the delivery of water to meet critical human needs

1031564 somethings working against barack obama you have to believe that the assault by the mccain people was one of the factors that is undermining him but i think its a short term gain at the long term expense of john mccain

1031566 the challengers got to put the bush administration more on trial than it has
1031567 three times now obama has injected race into the campaign
1031568 everybody knows hes black but there has been a very intentional effort to paint him as somebody outside the mainstream other hes not one of us its below the radar screen i think the mccain campaign has been scrupulous about not directly saying it but its the subtext of this campaign everybody knows it there are certain kind of signals as a native of the south i can tell you when you see this charlton heston ad the one

1031732 why there are so many what are the causes of it
1031733 how can we correct it how can we support people who have been wrongly convicted none of that is discussed within the media its just simply left and because of that we dont learn from it

1031779 employers have a clear legal duty to accommodate the religious practices of their workers
1031780 to deny someone employment because of apparent religious bias goes against long standing american traditions of tolerance and inclusion
1031781 the company will adhere to its employment policies of non discrimination as it relates to race color religion age gender sexual orientation or handicap and will ensure compliance with all legal and other regulations governing employment
1031782 say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty
1031783 o prophet tell thy wives and daughters and the believing women that they should cast their outer garments over their persons that they should be known and not molested
1031784 if the woman reaches the age of puberty no part of her body should be seen but this and he pointed to his face and hands
1031785 i dont hire people who insist on wearing headscarves or beards or dashikis or dreadlocks because it doesnt conform to our dress standards
1031786 whoever has a daughter and does not bury her alive a pre islamic practice forbidden by islam does not insult her and does not favor his son over her god will enter him into paradise
1031787 the believers men and women are protectors one of another
1031788 i dont hire people who insist on wearing headscarves or beards or dashikis or dreadlocks because it doesnt conform to our dress standards
1031789 the veil women writers on its history lore and politics
1031790 the quran itself does not suggest either that women should be veiled or they should be kept apart from the world of men on the contrary the quran is insistent on the full participation of women in society and in the religious practices prescribed for men
1031791 zin al din reviewed the interpretations of aya 30 from sura al nur and aya 59 from sura al ahzab which were cited above by al khazin al nafasi ibn masud ibn abbas and al tabari and found them full of contradictions yet almost all interpreters agreed that women should not veil their faces and their hands and anyone who advocated that women should cover all their bodies including their faces could not face his argument on any religious text if women were to be totally covered there would have been no need for the ayahs addressed to muslim men say to the believing men that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty sura al nur aya 30 she supports her views by referring to the sayings of the prophet muhammad s always taking into account what the prophet himself said i did not say a thing that is not in harmony with gods book 11 god says o consorts of the prophet ye are not like any of the other women ahzab 53 thus it is very clear that god did not want women to measure themselves against the wives of the prophet and wear hijab like them and there is no ambiguity whatsoever regarding this aya therefore those who imitate the wives of the prophet and wear hijab are disobeying gods will
1031792 just because people assume its part of their religion doesnt mean it is part of their religion
1031793 theres a movement afoot to alter our laws and our customs to accommodate a culture that happens to have religious overtones
1031794 all of a sudden all of those quotes from holy land defendants about saying one thing to an arab audience but another to an american audience are taking on a different light for me
1031795 north texas companies are increasingly making space for quiet rooms as muslim employees play a larger role in the u s workplace and feel more secure about verbalizing their faith
1031796 fire american citizens and give the jobs to muslims here on h1 b visas
1031797 based upon exhibits entered into evidence by the u s justice department in the recent u s v holy land foundation case
1031798 the subject of this blog item is a lawsuit in detroit against a mcdonalds restaurant that refused to hire two muslim women who insisted on wearing head scarves on the job
1031799 the judge said he needed to see paruks face to judge her truthfulness a basic fact of life in court ms muhammad refused opting to lose in court instead
1031800 county circuit court judge janet thorpe agreed with the state of florida that public safety concerns required that a drivers license show a full face photograph and that requiring a woman to remove her veil for that purpose would not restrict her religious freedom
1031801 a muslim woman has sued the state for suspending her drivers license after she refused to remove her face covering veil for the photo
1031802 if it is only a religious requirement then why are non muslim women forced to wear it
1031803 people are sometimes turned away from visiting christian cathedrals for violation of standards of dress
1031804 it could be a religious requirement to require people in muslim lands even non muslims to wear it
1031805 rules re admitance to private religious facilities are equated with laws of a country
1031806 tod submitted to the local protocol and customs now he expects the courtesy should be returned in his homeland but that is not going to happen
1031807 yes some do see wearing the hijab as a religious requirement
1031808 if a amp f must hire muslim women wearing burqas or whatever then they should hire any woman who wears it
1031809 if my sincerely held religious belief is that i must wear an exposed swastika pendant at work
1031810 this thread is not about what happens in iraq or iran or saudi arabia
1031811 there seems to be a backlash where americans want to keep non christians from practicing their religion in our country
1031812 either he shaves his beard or he goes home there is nothing in the koran that says he must have a beard
1031813 the protocol and custom in the united state is to honor freedom of religion
1031814 like many other orthodox women who follow halakha jewish law mrs berkowitz has worn a wig since her wedding day womens hair exudes sensual energy the talmud teaches and covering it insures a married womans modesty but the talmud also obliges a wife to care for her appearance so though a hat or scarf will do many orthodox women favor wigs the more natural looking the better
1031815 youll have a hard time convincing a court that such a fashion statement is done out of a sincerely held religious belief just saying so isnt enough im more than just skeptical
1031816 deputy prime minister cemil cicek signaled thursday that the government would not push for a fresh round of legislation to lift the head scarf ban a day after the countrys top court narrowly decided not to shut down the ruling party on grounds that it was trying to impose an islamic regime
1031817 you are in agreement that the young woman will have a hard time convincing the court that the wearing of a veil is a sincerely held religious belief since there is no consensus
1031818 our society is bending over backwards to accomodate the religious demands of a minority
1031819 if you dont like handling pork then dont work in a store where you will be handling pork products
1031820 but a woman wearing a scarf can perform the duties of an a amp f store employee
1031821 she can do her job just fine while wearing the scarf
1031822 yes some do see wearing the hijab as a religious requirement
1031823 ed technically you are correct the woman can perform the job duties but her wearing the veil does not project the image that a amp f is selling
1031824 how can an observant muslim women rationally justifying working in a store such as a amp f
1031825 the problem could have been avoided if the store manager had not mentioned anything about the veil
1031826 employees were allowed to wear professional lapel pins as well as seasonal holiday pins no other pins were permitted
1031827 as long as there is other employment available i fail to see how this merits a hampering of anyones religious freedom
1031828 the christian religion doesnt require the nurse to wear a cross but she wanted to as a way of practicing her religion
1031829 cair and its associates have stated that they want to see sharia law here in the us since it is higher than the constitution
1031830 so even though it isnt a requirement of the religion because she wants to wear a cross the employer must change the work rules
1031831 now i asked an earlier question concerning what would happen if a niqab wearing woman applied to work at a amp f
1031832 islamic fundamentalists do not recognize the separation of church and state as do we
1031833 i disapprove of what you say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
1031834 thats not the case at hand talk of niqabs and talk of excesses of europe and asia are red herrings
1031835 congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
1031836 a bill that will criminalise the promotion of vice incitement against the countrys leadership and insulting islam on the internet in an interview with al qabas newspaper he said that offenders would face up to a year in prison and or a fine if the victims are minors the prison term rises to seven years
1031837 we are not children you cant say if youre a good girl or boy were going to pass this and if youre not we wont
1031838 the ethics bill has to be signed as is and i think we should all be willing to sit down and compromise on the capital bill
1031839 i think what he was trying to show is hes willing to do anything to get the capital bill done
1031840 lets get it signed and get it out there and quit playing this game that it isnt strong enough
1031841 if this bill isnt strong enough sign the bill and next year well make it stronger
1031842 frankly its really quite concerning because to me hes thumbing his nose at the very real concern that certain contractors are bumping to the head of the line because of whom they know and who theyre contributing to
1031843 and the american people are probably the most polite in the world
1031844 in the 1960s we were very big in the midwest and we still have a good following
1031845 we provide the amplifiers and drums it makes things easier the hermits dont have to bring anything over from england
1031846 its hard to believe but thats a testament to how good the music is

1031849 you have to have a happy medium tonight the music was for an older crowd
1031850 this is what we do for a living and on a night like this who wouldnt want to play in front of a few thousand people
1031851 e chiaro che lajax voleva tenermi ma non mi stata negata la possibilit di andare via se ci fosse stata la possibilit di fare una scelta avrei potuto farla ma siccome questa possibilit non c stata mi sono concentrato sul mio presente e il mio presente con lajax

1031853 the value of alonso in the market will be really high we are really pleased with him and we dont want him to go unless we get a very good price
1031854 he felt that people had questioned his commitment a little bit and the best answer is always to play well on the pitch
1031855 you play well and show that you are ready to fight for the shirt and for your team you know how it is if you score goals people forget the frustration quickly
1031856 when do i tell the assessor its only my third d1 mens center
1031857 see this is why i dont listen to any of you
1031858 so how do you treat a game when both teams are whining from the very first minute
1031859 i dont have the mental references to put this into perspective for this level
1031860 and does that amount of talk back affect your game
1031861 aw shit i dont know thats why youre there to tell me if it is
1031862 i saw a lot of smiling from you you had a good presence and it was that presence that kept the game in control you heard their whines acknowledged it and moved on
1031863 elvis chuck berry carl perkins bo didderly yes those are the men who created rock and roll as we know it however in that list do not forget one jerry lee lewis fate dealt him an uneven hand due to the foibles of his personal life the subject of a movie great balls of fire with dennis quaid but his form of rockabilly boogie woogie piano driven music and madman presentation must be placed in the mix of influences that drove the best of early rock if for no other reason that that he is one of the few still standing from that generation it is nice to see what the killer can do in his 71st year in concert in new york city in 2006 with a host of guests some old some young clearly off these performances he has lost a couple of steps hell the kind of energy that jerry lee produced in the 1950s definitely had a short shelf life there are some nice clips from that period intertwined with the concert by the way

1031872 our industry right now is hungry for another round of innovation
1031873 64 bit versions of windows will begin to find their way into high end gaming notebooks which increasingly are being used as high end notebook workstations as opposed to strictly gaming systems
1031874 put more simply usage of 64 bit windows vista is growing much more rapidly than 32 bit
1031875 based on current trends this growth will accelerate as the retail channel shifts to supplying a rapidly increasing assortment of 64 bit desktops and laptops

1031878 obviously spore comes from a very strong pedigree and the title itself looks dynamic
1031879 certainly the expectations are very high sales of several million units but i wouldnt put it in the realm of
1031880 i think they dont need to appeal to anybody outside the hardcore wright and sims fans
1031881 needs to sell in the millions and last a few years to pay back the investment but you know we were probably going to spend the money on something it might as well be on spore
1031882 we dont provide financial breakouts for individual titles or any formulas we use in determining financial performance
1031883 that said i can tell you that no one at ea is measuring spore with the yardstick created by the sims theyre two totally different animals spore is a game that has a lot to offer players long after they make the original purchase a much different business model than traditional video games
1031884 while its important to have an actual game within the game
1031885 i think gamers are so fascinated already with the creature creator and the ability to make buildings and spaceships that their expectations are going to be a lot lower than what ea would need in another game
1031886 i think part of it will result from word of mouth and viral marketing
1031887 is it something that people want to talk to their friends about friends and family taking notice and saying gee i want to do that as well its a little bit premature to say definitively whether spore will do that or not
1031888 until i sit down and play the game end to end i just cant judge
1031889 its like the four blind men trying to describe an elephant ive had a chance to play various parts of the game but until i get a chance to play it all i just cant say

1031906 the corresponding lack of current liquidity the prolonged conflict in iraq and afghanistan and the impending strategic need to sell the forge division have all coalesced very quickly into a perfect storm that has forced a formerly robust small business to seek the protection of this court in order to deal with these issues in a manner that will maximize the value of its assets for all creditors

1031909 after you prayed i just knew it was going to be okay
1031910 so we go back to my place for sex then
1031911 you are a fat disgusting middle aged pig of a man who so far has displayed absolutely no manners is now at the point of being too drunk to be useful even if you were hot oh and you are french gypsy french
1031912 ive been playing for new york for a long time and somehow still dont get the respect i deserve
1031913 im talented i really am even though you cant tell
1031914 if you rely solely on a gatehouse paper for your news you have no idea that the company is in the toilet
1031915 well thats really sad i didnt know that barack obama had stooped to dishonesty you know pointing out weaknesses in other peoples campaigns or positions is also fair game but thats dishonest as you know first of all corporations are not allowed to give contributions to candidates and employees of oil companies give to barack obama as well as to john mccain so thats part number one thats dishonest and number two john mccain doesnt ask for any tax reduction for oil companies theres no special deal going to oil companies hes asking to reduce taxes on all corporations to help build our economy and strengthen jobs as well as reducing taxes on individuals so its simply dishonest as well as below the belt
1031916 just to clarify according to the washington post oil and gas industry executives and employees donated 1 1 million to john mccains campaign last month so i think that is what hes referring to in that ad
1031917 but what you dont point out is the employees and executives of the oil companies also gave money to barack obama and to suggest that they only gave to john mccain is dishonest theres no indication that thats the case in fact individuals can give to candidates of both parties and they regularly do
1031918 right well let me just ask you about this because if john mccain became president he wants to lower the corporate tax rate by 10 so 35 down to 25 and that would include companies like big oil and exxon mobil who took in 12 billion last quarter alone how do you explain that to the everyday joe whos seeing a larger chunk of their paycheck taken up by high gases prices and these oil companies are going to see more money in their pockets while the average guy is seeing less
1031919 well first of all hes lowering taxes for all corporations in america to help make us more competitive with other nations of the world where corporations are going because we have the highest corporate tax rate in the world next to japan so hes trying to build our economy and create more jobs and hes not singling out any one company or another

1031936 of course if shaw and didak are suspended the season is over anyway but it would be very irresponsible for the club to do that over such a trivial incident since their main responsibility is to win games for their members and other loyal fans

1031954 get there early we open early at 8 00 a m for iphone 3g sales monday through saturday and 9 00 a m on sunday be sure to arrive early since iphone 3g is sold on a first come first served basis
1031955 whether the iphone 3g has a universal power supply 110 240v 50 60 hz neither the store expert nor i could find any apple literature that states the ac power specification does anybody know for sure
1031956 so in essence i can come in here upgrade her line again and get another phone then transfer that new phone to my line and reactivate her original 3g back on her line
1031957 as long as you have an eligible line on your account you can get the lowest price on the phone so yeah you can do that its in essence a hardware swap on the line
1031958 what apple did by letting you get 2 phones on one line was unethical you already have the phone so we cant back charge you for the rest of the full price but just know that what apple did was wrong
1031959 i think the best reason not to upgrade to leopard is that apples acknowledged that 10 6 snow leopard will essentially be an optimized version of leopard with most of the bugs fixed unless you require software that wont run on tiger why would anyone buy leopard knowing that
1031960 you can open folders from the dock in leopard with a single click by pressing the command key
1031961 command clicking on an applications icon in the dock will open that programs folder and highlight the application icon in the folder

1031968 i know how my reputation preceeds me i know you will have heard more than i could ever tell you and i know you expect so much today what i have to say is so simple i loved a man once and he loved me when we fell together i was amazed that such love could exist between two people and i came to understand that this emotion was more powerful than anything he would tell me how beautiful i was so often that i slowly came to believe his words and as i came to believe it i became more beautiful and so often he would tell me how smart i was his words again and again the more he told me this the more i came to believe it and in believing it my wisdom grew his love for me filled me completed me and i grew into what he saw what he believed he believed me to be as beautiful as the sun the moon and stars he believed me to be as beautiful as orange evenings pink sunrise and a clear night sky and so i became these things so powerful was his love and so we became one being so even when i lost him to the almost endless war with the machines he was still within me i could still feel him love me i could feel him in my heart telling me of my beauty and i could still believe it and so my heart did not fade my eyes did not dim and although i was far away i could see this world we all stand in now and i knew i would be able to return and stand here before you as his wife and your friend we can rebuild together we have saved ourselves and all i ask you is that because i know of the purest love that could never be diluted please find it in each other too much destruction has been wreaked by human endeavour we have a world worth saving and worlds outside and beyond us rebuilding simply because i asked i want nothing else from the devotion i inspire than for you to honour the love i have shared with him by trying to find it yourselves and seeking restlessly to show it to all you pass in your days and i believe the adoration he showed me that i carry inside myself is more powerful than words let me show it to you

1031980 make an evaluation to see whether it has worked and should be extended to other cities
1031981 this is not a militarisation of cities but a clear response to the perceived demand for greater security
1031982 soldiers patrolling the centres of cities that are our greatest tourist attractions is not a very nice calling card for italy at the height of the tourist season

1031988 20 greater firm track range against all anti ship cruise missiles improves survivability

1031991 the navy has not only kept the arsenal ship concept alive and well but they evolved the program from 6 small dependent combatants into a class of 7 independent stealth battleships then had the program funded and pushed through congress in plain sight under the pretext of a more capable program

1031999 in fact nearly half of all pet owners told us they are skeptical of the quality of existing online pet sources
1032000 without a doubt the veterinarian is the most trusted authority for pet owners but the reality is that owners turn to the internet on a daily basis for health and wellness information
1032001 owners are confused about where to go and whom to trust and thats why webvets expert resources make it easier to be a better pet parent
1032002 because webvet offers one trusted and reliable place for pet owners to gather information about health care for pets it is a tremendous asset to both consumers and veterinarians
1032003 we want pet owners to have the resources they need to fully embrace and engage in their pets health and wellness as they would their own
1032004 webvet is the first resource that truly focuses on a pets body mind and soul combining ones own personal knowledge of what their pet needs with their veterinarians knowledge relative to their physical health
1032005 pet owners are deeply involved in all aspects of their pets lives

1032111 ci dovuto al fatto che i tesori ci sono ma sono poco fruibili questo a causa sia delle carenze nel settore dei trasporti sia della mancanza di servizi che affianchino le aree di interesse artistico come invece accade in altri paesi dove anche il pi piccolo museo dotato di servizi igienici bookshop ristorante e via dicendo la svizzera prima pur detenendo una percentuale di opere infinitesimali rispetto allitalia grazie alla sua capacit di valorizzarle
1032112 questo giudizio dal mero settore turistico potrebbe essere esteso allintera qualit della vita italiana basti pensare a napoli centro artistico deccellenza inserito in un contesto paesaggistico mozzafiato ma ahim discreditato dal problema dei rifiuti questa situazione danneggia il turismo cos come la vita degli stessi napoletani e ci vorranno decenni prima che le immagini di una citt sommersa dai rifiuti si cancellino dalla mente delle persone

1032366 as a standalone dow jones was a 1 8 billion company access to capital was limited now access is still not easy but we would not have been able to make the acquisitions we just made

1032509 deb if i am not mistaken i once read that you dont prefer to label yourself as a lesbian im confused about this since youve toss back and forth the concept of your identity which leaves me questioning if you are a lesbian at all to begin with being in one relationship doesnt qualify you to be a lesbian but possibly a bisexual bisexuals have the choice of being with a man or a woman regardless of monogamy if they choose your blog seems to draw a bigger straight fan base which is fine but call it what it is i dont view you as this big gay and lesbian icon for us but a voice that tends to cater to bisexuals and straight people your views and logic in life politics as well as religion all reflect heterosexuality if youre confused then i understand you need to let us know which team you play on and what kind of people you prefer to read your blog in your book you identify as a lesbian but on your blog you seem to teeter totter whats your story i apologize for the previous e mail i know i was rude i was just confused thanks lezlie

1032530 physical exercise has some value but spiritual exercise is much more important
1032531 and now about prayer when you pray dont be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them i assure you that is all the reward they will ever get but when you pray go away by yourself shut the door behind you and pray to your father secretly then your father who knows all secrets will reward you when you pray dont babble on and on as people of other religions do they think their prayers are answered only by repeating their words again and again dont be like them because your father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him
1032532 for religion is by man for men but spirituality is between god and man the individual
1032533 you try to justify the religious arguments being gay and your view of spiritualism yet they are incompatible religion and spirit filled life
1032534 stay spiritual find some religion you can accept to help your journey

1032545 in a reversal barack obama is proposing tapping the nations strategic oil reserves to help drive down gasoline prices his campaign said monday
1032546 i do not believe that we should use the strategic oil reserves at this point i have said and in fact supported a congressional resolution that said that we should suspend putting more oil into the strategic oil reserve but the strategic oil reserve i think has to be reserved for a genuine emergency you have a situation lets say where there was a major oil facility in saudi arabia that was destroyed as a consequence of terrorist acts and you suddenly had huge amounts of oil taken out of the world market we wouldnt just be seeing 4 a gallon oil we could see a situation where entire sectors of the country had no oil to function at all and thats what the strategic oil reserve has to be for

1032585 violet doesnt want to sit down and be interrogated every scene is something she really doesnt want to have except when shes drugged out and then she seems to be comfortable
1032586 ive been acting all my life and ive always felt you should be in shape im used to devoting my whole life to the work and what it requires
1032587 estelle has so much stamina and so much energy and she has stayed working and never retired
1032588 shes quite the opposite of violet but lets hope everyone is the opposite of that character
1032589 i dont know that ill be able to do this play at 80
1032590 and estelle didnt have the luxury of the rehearsal process that the original cast had most of her rehearsals for three weeks was blocking with the understudies she was just sort of thrown onstage
1032591 those people i hiked with hardly ever knew who i was

1032609 have you ever wondered what it would truly be like to meet somebody up in
1032610 hi body how is it going i know you sent to gas chambers too many members of my family i know you made soap out of their fat i also know that you made statues of gold out of our teeth and i also know that you painted portraits using jewish skin as a canvas but you know what that was on earth and it doesnt matter you are my friend now no remorse of any kind between us
1032611 have you ever thought about what your afterlife in hell will be like
1032612 the next time you feel pangs of resentment for anybody think about how it would be if you two were walking toward one another on the other side with the full knowledge that life was one big movie
1032613 in the mean time i am to allow jesus to live within me and live his life through me
1032614 when your faith is tested your endurance has a chance to grow so let it grow for when your endurance is fully developed you will be strong in character and ready for anything

1032619 how does the sex part work what do you do
1032620 for they seem to reflect the erotization of lesbians in popular culture almost makes it seem as though all women could swing either way and are just biding their time until their prince comes
1032621 oh shes a lesbian right now cause she cant find mr
1032622 i will say this theres a huge part of the gay community men who do love the thought of sleeping around
1032623 in fact i could tell you that womens maternal instinct is much stronger than the males paternal instinct and you are living proof of it because i read in one of your posts that you want to have a child and have even found a
1032624 and if wasnt for my future donor who ive already claimed and he has accepted then i wouldnt have the option of deciding whether or not to bear a child of my own
1032625 do you think that some of the guys see you as a bit deviant in you sexuality so they ask things of you that they wouldnt ask a heterosexual couple
1032626 i dont know any happy lesbians but those two are my only point of reference
1032627 wow these girls are so horny that theyll have sex with another girl and maybe even me

1032648 we asked him hey we know youre going to be out we want you to study and make sure you have everything and hes gone another step beyond that
1032649 it just shows what kind of player and what kind of person he is and what kind of interest certainly he has in this football team in getting himself better along with the rest of the guys
1032650 when i got down to this end of the street i could see they were at least 12 or 13 feet up over the roof and no fire trucks in the neighborhood people running trying to grab stuff people getting stuff out of their houses it was panic mode for the whole neighborhood it was pretty scary
1032651 most of our friends abroad have long since come to the conclusion that this country on this topic just doesnt get it

1032678 after his 2006 election the senate democratic leadership agreed to give lieberman the homeland security committee chairmanship if he provided the decisive vote to make the democrats a 51 to 49 senate majority however with additional democratic senators likely to be elected this year that agreement is expected to be null and void in the new congress

1032686 this paper explores the relationship between integral theory and ideology i have identified three ideologies specific to a variety of integral theories and practices using categories which most easily demonstrates how these ideologies correspond to those which drive world events i refer to them as fundamentalist neo liberal and neo conservative my hope is to provide an in depth analysis of how particular integral theories and practices lend themselves to the three ideological orientations under review any attempt to understand the reasons that these ideologies have crept into specific integral theories or practices requires tracing their genealogy in tracing genealogies i wish to show that the ideological sources particular to specific integral theories and practices are not only to be found in historical figures or events but are to be located through an excavation of their very organizing ideas the importance of this study is two fold the first of course is to uncover any ideological drivers integral theory brings with it to the table in its socio political analysis
1032687 perhaps more importantly gebsers thought is incommeasurable with certain key beliefs of modernism that he attributed to the
1032688 teilhards discussion is centered more on development of mankind then on consciousness itself
1032689 the specific population i wish to consider under the rubric of fundamentalism are westerners who adopt eastern spiritual practices
1032690 it is in fact the transference of hindu religious practices on to integral yoga which has facilitated a fascination of some of his followers with the fundamentalist rhetoric of todays militant hindu nationalism hinduvta
1032691 what is it about tangible goods that makes them sub jects for property rights why are tangible goods property
1032692 o nly because scarcity exists is there even a problem of formulating moral laws insofar as goods are superabundant
1032693 good fences make good neighbors it is clear given the origin justification and function of property rights that they are applicable only to scarce resources
1032694 he who receives an idea from me receives instruction himself without lessening mine as he who lights his taper at mine receives light without darkening me
1032695 ideas are not naturally scarce however by recognizing a right in an ideal object one creates scarcity where none existed before
1032696 it is a peculiarity of property rights in patents and copyrights that they do not arise out of the scarcity of the objects which become appropriated
1032697 natural scarcity is that which follows from the relation ship between man and nature scarcity is natural when it is possible to conceive of it before any human institution al contractual arrangement artificial scarcity on the other hand is the outcome of such arrangements artificial scarcity can hardly serve as a justification for the legal framework that causes that scarcity such an argu ment would be completely circular on the contrary artificial scarcity itself needs a justification
1032698 only naturally scarce entities over which physical control is possible are candidates for
1032699 m onopoly privilege and censorship lie at the historical root of patent and copyright
1032700 let us recall that ip rights give to pattern creators partial rights of control ownership over the tangible property of everyone else
1032701 we have developed a strategic relationship with newtec over the years and have found its products to be both innovative and highly reliable

1032721 neck and neck polls show john mccain and barack obama statistically tied is mccain winning the ad war
1032722 mccain has erased much of obamas earlier lead on the gallup poll
1032723 how do you read this how should we interpret this
1032724 i think one conclusion you can draw is as crude as it was the ad that the mccain people ran comparing obama to britney spears and paris hilton may have cut through with some voters to the place where obama would be the most vulnerable and that is that is he is a person of some inexperience
1032725 i think theres a high possibility that all this could blow up in their face and backfire
1032726 senator mccain has not been shy whatsoever about his attacks on barack obama in the old adage old political adage if you allow your opponent to define you youre going to end up in serious trouble is obama allowing this to happen
1032727 well this is what the mccain people were trying to do they were trying to make this a referendum on barack obama and i think to a certain extent they have succeeded in that
1032728 obamas going to respond now by going negative on mccain he has a new ad out this morning whereas he is accusing mccain of being in the pocket of big oil and saying you know that mccain is trying to give all the big oil companies a tax break here where obama is trying to be for the little guy but weve got a campaign now where both sides have gone negative despite what both sides said at the beginning about how we can make this a positive discussion

1032749 the biggest flaw for a resume is when it fails to showcase a persons accomplishments contributions and results and instead spouts a job description of each position hes held

1032803 if youre any good at this you know when to express your opinions and when not to
1032804 im very realistic about where i stand and the perceptions of what i do based on things like special comments sort of being out front in a very anti establishment way if they said to me listen we need you to do this id do it despite a reputation sometimes deserved in the past im very much a team player for these guys but i knew when i went off in my direction that going back would be almost impossible i believe truly if for some reason they thought it was a good idea i think i could do it and i could do it fairly and i think people would be stunned by it but its one of those tv things about perception being reality ive done a lot of things people said i could never do im coming up on the 25th anniversary of the first general manager of a tv station he told me i would never work in this business theres a lot of stuff ive overcome but i dont think people would buy into it no matter how well i did it
1032805 that was where chris didnt know who had anchored his own primary coverage sean hannity and alan colmes and bill oreilly did an hour couple of times during primary coverage and laura ingraham filled in for oreilly as usual for them its just a smokescreen to justify what they have already done if youre any good at this you know when to express your opinions and when not to
1032806 the one right after the hillary one was one that was almost done in a whisper to john mccain and what i thought was most interesting was critics saying they had become so frequent now but im doing them less frequently now than i have at any time in the past so thats a perception its the same thing that dovetails on the idea that theres more criticism of what im doing on air more people are watching them more people are seeing the show were in a position most nights of second or third in the demo in cable news so people will see all of them its the george carlin joke somewhere in the world there has to be the worlds worst doctor so yeah i admit it one of the special comments one of the 130 or so that ive done is the worst special comment ever
1032807 generally ive succeeded on these when ive relied on my instinct but i do listen to other people i always prefer to do ones where ive waited a day and literally slept on it i keep saying im going to write a short one eventually but by the time i get done theyre always 10 minutes as long as it holds together through the length of it it shouldnt make that much difference im probably just replacing a britney spears story with it to some degree im a little defensive about the idea that theyre too long because what is it that we should put on instead they are isolated separate segments theyre designed to be distinct from the rest of the network and even distinct from the rest of what i do

1032868 this is a different season for me because i have chances of being a starter and i know for sure that i will stay on the team past pre seasons were always hard for me because i never knew if i was going to stay the years have luckily normalized my situation on the team and helped me be more relaxed
1032869 the squad tries to distance itself from rumours about players that may leave the team everybody likes to play for real madrid but it sometimes takes too long to make progress on this team it is sometimes better to leave and play somewhere else than to stay here and hardly play at all i nevertheless think robinhos case is rather special he feels well and happy at real madrid a player like him likes to be valued the club knows he is a strong asset for the future and i believe all madridismo wants him to stay
1032870 last year was good but we expect to improve we have the same squad and a very clear idea of what we want we weant to have a good start to the season in order to have a comfortable lead that allows us to use all our weaponry in europe we want to be one of the best four teams in the continent which is what real madrid deserves to be anyway
1032871 we had a very positive experience in the algarve and we hope to return there for many years it was a mixture between spending leisure time together and work we trained for over two hours every day and then enjoyed the spectacular surroundings in the evenings it was nice to spend more time together that way

1032990 a equipe est evoluindo bem cometemos alguns erros no ataque e as bolas de tr s n o ca ram mas foi um bom jogo para pegar ritmo vamos melhorar a pontaria e chegar cem por centro para a estr ia contra a cor ia o que o nosso objetivo

1033035 last night everything came together and i am now moving to real madrid
1033036 as everybody might know i have always wanted to move to spain because i have a strong bond with that country now im going to play for real madrid its a dream comes true
1033037 tomorrow tuesday afternoon i will be presented at real madrid this will be the start of a new chapter in my life i will do everything to help the team and the club to win trophies
1033038 its really tough hes in a lot of pain and we predict the worst
1033039 i was hoping to have added to the squad by now and brought a few in to give the players a lift
1033040 its not just a new face we need its new faces
1033041 my big concern is that anybody we bring in now probably wont be ready to start the premier league season
1033042 its now getting to the stage where you are wondering how long it takes for new players to settle etc
1033043 im hoping we will have some in before the start of the season newtonheath1878
1033044 i cannot understand how an argentine player who has been in pre selection for the olympic squad and has played in the champions league and at a club like liverpool is not good enough
1033045 now we have to look for a solution maybe find a team for him on loan but we have maybe eight or 10 teams in spain italy and greece asking about him
1033046 man i think the key to me is this i have been counting down the days to get back on that field once the initial shock of my injury wore off
1033047 i just want to help my team win nothing more or less i am so hungry just to get back after it i feel like i want to go outside in the parking lot and play right now and these two guys sitting here with me mccoy and mckillop deserve all the attention they are going to get they are both superstars and both great teammates who work hard
1033048 i havent felt contact getting hit with pads on in over a year and a half
1033049 so when i get hit for the first time and get up and im all right thats when i know ill be good to go
1033050 voters realize that is deceitful and they are sick of it
1033051 basically the supreme court has condoned illegal coordination with candidates
1033052 the door is open to another lawsuit if we are able to develop different evidence so i think the unions still have to be very careful
1033053 no matter how much money the unions throw at this race they cannot stop me from going door to door

1033055 the hope colorado state university can generate the intellectual capitol that can bring good jobs
1033056 i think the people in fort collins regardless of whether they are a republican democrat or unaffiliated are concerned about education and lifelong education

1033061 stop the dehumanizing stereotypes stop the jokey violence there is no place in advertising for cruelty pull the campaign do it now
1033062 your commercial is just a cartoonish recapitulation of matthew shepards brutal murder
1033063 all of us who professionally use the mass media are the shapers of society we can vulgarize that society we can brutalize it or we can help lift it onto a higher level
1033064 advertising reflects the mores of society but it does not influence them

1033066 alaska is young georgia north carolina and virginia have growing populations and many black voters
1033067 made a living hunting and killing large whales by biting off their tails and flippers
1033068 it takes a lot of computing power to analyze something as relatively simple as a set of jaws since youre dealing with all sorts of complex shapes in biology
1033069 if its a relatively small target and if they are at all unsure what it is they may be biting into it might be a lump of bone or steel then its highly unlikely that youre going to see anything like their maximum bite force
1033070 its the biggest bite force known for any living animal so far although its certainly possible that the killer whale or possibly the larger crocodiles have more powerful bites
1033071 greater than for a living white shark but puny compared to big tooth
1033072 i have to say that i am pretty impressed with just how complex and sophisticated the feeding apparatus of the shark is
1033073 with all the mammalian predators ive looked at a lot of the muscle force going into the bite is actually lost the shark has a much more efficient lever system going on
1033074 these sharks go after large prey that can hurt them and theyd rather not get hurt so they attack with a single horrendously traumatizing bite and then swim back and wait for their prey to die of blood loss
1033075 even though cartilage is vastly more elastic than bone cartilage did not result in much lower bite force at all maybe 5 percent or less
1033076 most if not all cats and a lot of dog species have more powerful bites pound for pound
1033077 but because these sharks are so big you have these giant bite forces
1033078 their teeth are very sharp and serrated more or less like steak knives so they dont need that much force to puncture and tear out flesh
1033079 and they have a conveyer belt of these teeth they keep on growing rows and rows of them so the teeth fall out and are replaced well before they go blunt
1033080 estimating the bite force in a big dead fish is a tad esoteric
1033081 the way in which we model the jaws of a shark are exactly how wed model the face of a human
1033082 large sharks actually do a considerable amount of damage to underwater communications systems
1033083 you can get amazing details about the ecology and evolution of an animal by understanding how it feeds which is after all a very important part of what animals do
1033084 the olympic symbol expresses the activity of the olympic movement and represents the union of the five continents and the meeting of from throughout the world at the olympic games
1033085 in contrast to the 4 7 billion movie tickets sold in america in 1947 there were only 1 57 billion tickets sold in 2003
1033086 no matter how sophisticated you make these automated systems youre not going to make them perfect and all you can really strive for is to tune them as you go along
1033087 its pretty clear there was a lapse in terms of the quality control of yahoos keyword list
1033088 leverages a combination of algorithmic and editorial processes to identify current relevant and popular terms
1033089 we are really only in the infancy of this kind of automated analysis
1033090 im sure its going to be expanding greatly not just in volume but in sophistication
1033091 if it does succeed its going to be done in a way thats subtle enough that its there for people who want it
1033092 but its not going to be intrusive for people who dont

1033119 its not a concern to us the expert advice that we are getting is that the situation continues to improve and the measures shutting factories and limiting traffic they put in place are still having a positive effect
1033120 we have had three or four days of outstanding blue sky weather and we do not think it is going to be an issue
1033121 theres a really positive atmosphere in the team people are really excited they have trained for their whole lives for this moment and they are like coiled springs waiting to explode
1033122 the village is fantastic absolutely unbelievable athletes have never had such good conditions as they have here in beijing
1033123 the smog did not seem to affect us when we trained this morning we have no issues with that its mainly the heat and humidity
1033124 we have been training in macau for a couple of weeks where it was hotter and more humid so hopefully by the time it comes to the matches we will be used to it
1033125 it has been 43 degrees celsius pitchside which has been pretty tough but it gets easier every day you can never cool down due to the humidity so we are using every technique we can to cool players when they come off the pitch even ice blankets

1033127 necesitamos profundizar la reflexi n sobre las demandas hist ricas que los pueblos ind genas han formulado en distintos foros y espacios de nuestras naciones la impostergable necesidad de que se respeten sus derechos fundamentales a estar representados en los mbitos pol tico y social a mantener y desarrollar sus lenguas y pr cticas culturales a que el estado impulse firmemente el rescate de su identidad y a obtener el reconocimiento de sus formas tradicionales de posesi n de las tierras
1033128 cada cultura tiene algo para aportar y occidente ha mutilado durante siglos las lenguas creencias arte y pr cticas que los pueblos originarios aportaban y que el genocidio colonialista aniquil
1033129 la insistente lucha que hasta hoy han mantenido estos pueblos por su bienestar y para asegurar sus derechos humanos sigue siendo una demanda vigente en nuestra regi n
1033130 esa lucha por la supervivencia y la identidad mantenida durante siglos ha dado sus frutos
1033131 pese a que muchos pueblos fueron extinguidos los que han sobrevivido son hoy parte de la comunidad internacional aunque a n haya mucho camino por recorrer hasta llegar a su completo reconocimiento social jur dico y cultural
1033132 es en virtud de ese derecho que los pueblos determinan libremente su condici n pol tica y persiguen libremente su desarrollo econ mico social y cultural

1033160 dont go to the competition whose waiters are terrible turn all that frustration at their incompetence into a wonderful dining experience here
1033161 having been in asia on business and studying over the years i know that none of the people involved with this restaurant will welcome someone telling them their translation is wrong over and over i found badly translated english signs that no one would correct because the act of correction would make the person who made the error feel bad it always makes me wonder how they do so well in the world but nevertheless they do
1033162 what this sign is telling us is that they used software to do the translation and the quality control when printing this sign was poor and this is a hilarious mistake it has nothing to do with anything political

1033177 we as a civilization are duty bound to encourage technological know how however before we make the mistake of convincing ourselves that a knack for writing software is more valuable than the ability to simply write well we might consider looking anew at the souvenir that is the book one day computer programs these objects of our fascination and frustration will learn to write themselves and well be left with our ideas however grand or shallow

1033189 canadian nationalists trying to ring fence our sovereignty are engaged in an especially ironic struggle given their citizenship in the nation that invented the modern more supple form of sovereignty federalism those who are most determined to draw deeper lines in the ongoing crusade against american encroachment on our national sovereignty are often the strongest advocates of canada s leadership in the development of global governance through multilateral institutions the contradiction reveals less about their convictions about sovereignty than about their plain vanilla anti americanism

1033249 the area that is causing some concern is that although their asian growth is good it is slower than it was and if you extrapolate from that then growth is going to be really slow
1033250 a recession in the united states is a real risk
1033251 the length and depth of that is uncertain i think if a recession occurred it could be shallow but any meaningful recovery in the housing market is unlikely before next year
1033252 there can be no prospect of a fundamental recovery in this business
1033253 in choosing a new captain we were keen to identify a player who could lead the team in all three forms of cricket and bring fresh enthusiasm and ideas to the role of captain

1033258 dhoni has been declared the recipient of the rajiv gandhi khel ratna award the countrys most prestigious sports award
1033259 he has represented the country with distinction and deserves the honour
1033260 his exemplary leadership and demeanour under pressure especially in the icc world twenty20 and the tri series in australia mark him out as the ideal role model for millions of young indians who want to make a mark in life
1033261 it is a brave decision because kp pietersen hasnt done much captaincy before but i think he has matured a lot in the last couple of years
1033262 we are all very sad michael has decided to step down having been such an influential figure in the dressing room it is going to take some time getting used to someone else being in charge
1033263 it is a big job ive done it a few times and you only had to see how much it meant to michael vaughan yesterday to realise it is an encompassing job
1033264 it is going to be a massive job he will have an abundance of confidence to believe he can do it and he will have the full support of all the players around him
1033265 kp pietersen is a very decisive person and i am sure he will feel he is up to the challenge it is a bit of a step into the unknown because he hasnt captained before but it is a new start for us
1033266 i think he does play for the team i think that selfish aspect is overplayed he would probably admit in his youth he was a bit like that but i dont think he is like that so much now
1033267 the one thing i would say about kevin is everything he has done in his career so far he has easily stepped up to the mark and found a way to deal with it
1033268 he is an exceptional batsman and it would take quite a lot for something external to affect his batting
1033269 i thought straussy had a really good chance too but theyve chosen kevin and hes got some really good people around him

1033282 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election

1033291 we used to be terrified of the forces manning checkpoints because they had the authority to question us and we just didnt know which way to lie
1033292 they could be anything now we fear only about 25 percent of them which we can call a development

1033295 it would be seen as a loss in terms of talent but i think its positive he went to a customer instead of another chip competitor
1033296 i dont believe the round has failed we still have enormous possibilities to negotiate
1033297 i was very clear in telling bush that it wasnt possible that two countries negotiating a nuclear treaty arent able to agree on food issues because theres little difference between them
1033298 all that is linked to the possibility countries have to develop

1033315 as millions died the imperial government launched a militarized campaign to collect the tax arrears accumulated during the drought the money which ruined those who might otherwise have survived the famine was used by lytton to fund his war in afghanistan even in places which had produced a crop surplus the governments export policies like stalins in the ukraine manufactured hunger in the north western provinces oud and the punjab which had brought in record harvests in the preceding three years at least 1 25m died

1033331 we do not approve of your lifestyle but neither do we condemn you
1033332 if this doesnt work i can always get out of it
1033333 god has brought us together and with his help we can overcome any problems
1033334 when someone is attacking theyre really verbalizing their own pain
1033335 they feel freer to vent their pain in church because the pastor is supposed to love them anyway
1033336 almost without fail churches with a problem have a breakdown in communication
1033337 our church culture has created an environment in which a victim can make a few calls and put the church in absolute chaos
1033338 if a person doesnt have the personal integrity or level of concern to address his issue personally the church should ignore it
1033339 a lot of what feeds anxiety in church is when people feel dismissed or marginalized
1033340 it comes when they feel their viewpoint doesnt matter and no one cares what they think
1033341 we trust the congregation under the leadership of the holy spirit to find the line of truth through all the perceptions and commit to that
1033342 to the degree that you can love and accept your spouses family to that degree you will enrich your own marriage
1033343 there is a great deal of idealism wrapped up in a pastors desire to serve people through the church and to serve people in the church
1033344 probably the thing they ministers do most often is assume they have more authority than they do
1033345 we have thrown our pastors into this work sort of sink or swim and its getting harder to swim
1033346 they dont expect their friends and supporters not to defend them
1033347 its very easy not to set boundaries to protect your family health or spiritual development
1033348 its an honor to have arthur sulzberger deliver the opening keynote
1033349 as someone who transformed the new york times company from a print business into a global internet company he brings a unique perspective to the challenges and opportunities facing digital media
1033350 a rather scarily long list of great ideas for ways to support the community
1033351 weve got loads of plans were going to support it massively
1033352 content packs new objects new game modes all of this stuff could be done what were basically waiting to see is what the demand is for
1033353 we can do all of that stuff we will do all of that stuff but what order we do it in and how much weight we throw behind any of the different ideas that different people have got is totally down to what the community does
1033354 that really excites me because if people are loving the costumes we can crank them out if people are loving the levels and master classes weve got a slightly scarily long list of great ideas for ways to support the community and its just a matter of prioritising at this stage
1033355 i can definitely say that there will be content thats available to people free of charge im just not saying exactly what that content is going to be right now
1033356 it was humbling to see god work and especially work through us we are just a group of normal everyday people who have no special training or skills just a heart to be used by god
1033357 after being there in guadalajara seeing the people who have so little yet worshipping before our king knowing they are rich in blessings well i know i was ministered to just being with them in worship even though i went to minister to them
1033358 out in the large open courtyard there were hundreds of male prisoners dressed in white and khaki visiting with their families many were so young the christian prisoners with their bibles in hand sang and praised the lord with us
1033359 we heard from the prisoners that they feel neglected by people especially churches and they reminded us of the scripture in matthew where it says i was in prison and you visited me
1033360 even though there was the language barrier we communicated through our music but mostly through smiles and tears and hugs
1033361 we saw many people mostly adults receive salvation and that was truly awesome
1033362 i witnessed firsthand gods sovereignty and provision in this trip
1033363 i hate being a ministers wife and i dont want to talk about it
1033364 it all depends on the internal culture of the church and biblical parameters that jesus gave us
1033365 a church that puts love and caring and living in the tree of life above everything else wont have these problems
1033366 it seems like it comes down to just selfish behavior rather than really listening to what god wants you to do
1033367 it is hard when people very openly oppose your husband because you love him
1033368 in a larger church there is a little more give and take
1033369 if it is a smaller church she is expected to pick up where other people drop off whether it is her gift or not
1033370 my mission being a mama now is making sure my kids are taken care of
1033371 as a ministers wife i first have to be a god pleaser and first do what he has called me to do and sometimes that means that i stay home from church on sunday nights because my kids are exhausted and thats what they need
1033372 the average woman has five to nine people she is close to and she usually looks for more but the average ministers wife has from one to three and she usually doesnt look for more
1033373 find an identity outside the church or find a time that is identity related outside the church so that you have someone outside you can turn to for support
1033374 you can say if someone insults my husband it doesnt affect me yes it hurts but you can help each other through it if you only live through him you cant separate yourself from attacks on him
1033375 you are not him and he is not you that has to be established when you go to a church with separate identities you can be a help to each other instead of trying to live his life for him its overwhelming to take on both
1033376 she came to munich and fell in love with the city and the people
1033377 even though the lord allowed her to have cancer he wasnt finished with her ther esa didnt want to go back to the states without accomplishing all that she could on the field she was determined that she was going to stay here and receive her treatments
1033378 missions became her life she was committed to ministry until her very last breath
1033379 she was quiet but a strong encourager of others theresa exhibited a grace and beauty rarely seen
1033380 through her life and her illness she wanted god to be glorified
1033381 in the midst of pain and suffering her desire was still to reach out to people even to the hospital staff
1033382 when we consider the 150 years of ministry at first baptist church of ironton we cannot help but recognize that all the glory is due to him
1033383 who else can receive the worship and praise for the strengthening of the church with faith love knowledge of christs love and the fullness of god for these many years who would have fathomed that this church begun so long ago would have continued to this day the answer to both questions is god and god alone
1033384 a year of hamas bbc correspondent aleem maqbool spoke to residents of gaza
1033385 for much of the 20th century the only u s christians engaged beyond the united states were missionaries diplomats and military types with jet planes and globalization this reality has shifted dramatically
1033386 for too long we were led to believe that being called to missions meant 30 or 40 years in africa
1033387 that led to a lot of guilty feelings but it also provided a good excuse for not becoming a missionary
1033388 first century missionaries were not so much vocational missionaries as professionals with a vocation that went on missions
1033389 paul was a tentmaker he didnt stay in one place the book of acts records pauls three missionary journeys in reality paul was a short term missionary
1033390 we are seeing a new generation of volunteer missions where churches are becoming strategically involved with particular teams or people groups overseas and in longer term relationships churches and those who go on short term mission trips are at the table in developing mission strategies its a brand new strategic environment
1033391 in a sense were moving away from the word volunteers and instead are using short term mission teams we really do see that the local church has a strategic role in fulfilling the great commission and in being a significant partner in reaching people groups
1033392 but that impact is far greater when we work with people inside the country who prepare for our trips and help us work in a culturally sensitive and effective way
1033393 if short term and long term mission workers are together in developing strategy its an asset the key is that the strategy is one that everyone buys into
1033394 the longer term missionary perhaps has an insight into the culture and the beliefs and world views of a region which a church at the beginning would not have though a church can learn it but the energy and creativity of short term mission teams can enhance
1033395 but if you get a number of churches who do that and partner together maybe not so much with each other but through an organization like buckner you can make a bigger impact
1033396 and not just for us but for the whole church if we dont get involved ourselves then it doesnt change us
1033397 these trips really opened my eyes to see that god is not just the god of america but the god of the whole world
1033398 these trips have given me a deeper heart for missions and for the need for missions
1033399 so whether or not i end up as a businessman or a full time missionary i know that i will definitely be involved in missions for the rest of my life its a passion
1033400 the church body is strengthened by this faithful obedience and by participating in gods plan
1033401 we have numerous examples of individuals that have experienced this transformational power in their lives and gone on to become church leaders mission team leaders and missionaries theyve become more active in every aspect of the churchs ministries because they went on a mission trip
1033402 short term volunteers cannot be effective without a recipient infrastructure
1033403 long after were gone the indigenous personnel are the ones who will carry on the work
1033404 whether it be feeding programs group homes foster care kinship care they are the true missionaries were just there to support
1033405 many of the long term u s missionaries had to leave but we were in constant contact with staff we were still able to sustain operations
1033406 im glad that many short term responders grasp the fact that a single mission trip that lasts a week can make a real difference in the lives of both the participants and the people to whom they minister
1033407 ive seen a short term responders life absolutely revolutionized because of the experience but the greatest transformation comes in a long term engagement that is strategic and sustainable
1033408 the problem with short term missions is that people often look at them as oh this is great for me but their work should definitely be part of a long term goal or commitment whether to a certain area or people group or ministry
1033409 but it takes a lot of work to collaborate and work together and listen to each other
1033410 its important for americans to come in as the learner helper and supporter
1033411 the global church has joined the u s church in a dramatic way
1033412 in many instances its much more spiritually and missionally vital than the u s church
1033413 it is important that we connect these christians who serve effectively around the world and that we bring them into partnerships with each other so that all of us are more strategic as we share the good news of the gospel of jesus christ
1033414 wii music completes what miyamoto wrote in his proposal when he came up with the idea for the wii
1033415 he was saying that he needs to think up more ideas now
1033416 most of the ideas for accessories that we had initially come up with are out now we might think up some more and we might make them if we do but we dont have any plans to release a whole lot more
1033417 were making the ps3 version first and then porting to the 360 later im telling the development team to not think about the xbox 360 right now we can think about it after the development kits arrive right now were fully concentrating on the ps3 version
1033418 to promote interoperability microsoft has committed to designing products in accordance with four interoperability principles principle iv open engagement recognizes that collaboration with customers partners developers open source communities and other vendors is of critical importance the collaborative spirit so central to this event truly embodies what mvps are all about mvps are our greatest advocates and our harshest critics and our most real customers this amazing event really underlines the value of mvps independence from microsoft and their credibility in the community for the benefit of customers and the company
1033419 the smell of mold and decaying plants is overpowering in some places where the flood waters have come up and gone back down the houses and their contents are ruined or at least damaged beyond belief most flooded neighborhoods are piled up with soggy moldy contents of homes
1033420 were grateful that people like the national guard members are able to come into town and help us with the protection of the levees
1033421 this is one of the ways we can reach out to that group and to the community to help
1033422 we currently have tractor trailers transported from businesses in hull ill that have been compromised as well as a shuttle pick up drop off for businesses and assistance groups on hwy 168
1033423 we have worked with our local newspaper the hannibal courier post whose offices are located in the downtown riverfront area to establish a contingency plan in case of hcp evacuation
1033424 the hcp has been offered computer labs offices and classroom space to set up newspaper operations on the hlg campus
1033425 to comb the neighborhoods assess damage and field requests from homeowners then the crew begins removing furnishings tearing out drywall soaked carpets and baseboards
1033426 it is most unusual to find a basement in louisiana alabama or mississippi especially along the coast
1033427 however there are 25 000 basements in rapid city iowa even after the streets were dry the basements are still full of water heating units freezers of rotting food and other toxic agents make this recovery quite different from katrina
1033428 the initial work will be done by the abc crews using hazmat suits and heavy duty respirators
1033429 this will be a long term effort and cbf will step up to the task and make a difference in the live of those with the greatest needs and least re sources
1033430 right now there are shower trailers and mud out units working in des moines cedar rapids and wapello
1033431 i think there is a possibility that some will be moved to ottumwa iowa city and cedar falls as well in some cases the water is still too high
1033432 the mud out teams have been very evangelistic as they work on the homes
1033433 in des moines three people have been saved this past week with the mud out crews leading their homeowners to faith in jesus weve been carefully collecting contact information and making sure churches are linked up with them to provide good follow up for them
1033434 we can feel your whole christian community behind you they sent 20 but we can feel the prayers of 2 000
1033435 that is because we want you to return and bring back others to share christ with our countrymen
1033436 thank you very much for your time you did the very good job in cenkovice please give our best regards in your church now i pray that god could send more others christians to our country in next summer
1033437 perhaps because gardening is the first job god gave us
1033438 many would like to have a vegetable garden to help fight the high prices of food and or for recreation but many are unable to do so in the context of their multi housing situation
1033439 people start working together and develop a sense of pride and ownership in the neighborhood
1033440 we always close by asking how can we pray for you
1033441 the church can be here and invest in the community and show that it cares
1033442 so often churches try to offer spiritual help before physical needs are met we are meeting physical needs filling bellies
1033443 this is a valuable and critical area in which churches need to get involved
1033444 community gardening is such a good idea its god honoring and it helps people its a love love or a win win scenario as i see it
1033445 ca tico mas n s controlamos e estamos vivendo um momento maravilhoso
1033446 o advogado da atriz rejeitou repetidamente as tentativas dos agentes federais de interrog la

1033451 os agentes da dea tamb m foram agressivos com o departamento de pol cia de nova york
1033452 tiveram que amea ar pedir uma intima o antes de poder obter o arquivo de ledger
1033453 if we believe come all who are weary and heavy laden we must love people not turn them away a lot of the couples in non traditional lifestyles are couples who have grown up in the church
1033454 we open our membership to anyone we start with where they are and help them
1033455 we take the stand of grace something our entire staff shares
1033456 trying to determine whos at fault isnt productive we take the now what approach since this has happened now what
1033457 acceptance is not the same thing as condoning but if you provide the acceptance there is room to grow
1033458 if you point fingers people are more likely to walk away
1033459 i would rather err on the side of acceptance people grow with grace ive never seen anyone grow under legalism why would people want to go to a church that adds more burdens
1033460 but weve got to love them with the love that is christ based not human based
1033461 its the churchs responsibility to help the family stay together
1033462 if the church lets them down in this area how can it be trusted in other areas
1033463 a church needs more than just the pastor to work with the situation
1033464 i would let the spouse at fault know he should find another church
1033465 by the power vested in me by the state of fill in the blank i pronounce you husband and wife
1033466 every five years if i want to do weddings in virginia i have to re apply for a license and swear or affirm that i will be an officer of the court not as a lawyer which is ok but as a minister so the commonwealth of virginia will recognize the ceremonies
1033467 i do think many ministers resent becoming agents official agents of the state to perform marriages
1033468 and so this coupling of the sacred and the civil occurred early in the united states and is widely the case today
1033469 it is a problem when the government appropriates to itself the power to unilaterally redefine marriage in a way that is not consistent with the will or the traditions of the people because the government alone cannot create a marriage tradition powerful enough to preserve and protect the governments main interest in marriage bringing together men and women to make and raise the next generation together
1033470 civil government has always been viewed as having a role in marriage because the common good is so heavily at stake in its protection and preservation
1033471 theres a reason the government has always been involved in marriage but not in baptism or my priests vow of celibacy
1033472 marriage is not a sacrament that has only religious implications like baptism
1033473 to frame the same gender marriage issue as exclusively about gay and lesbian civil rights fails to take seriously the issues at stake many of us believe that same sex marriage may offer important potential social goods from increasing stability for children raised by parents in same sex partnerships to greater social attention toward the legitimate needs of gay and lesbian people
1033474 but we recognize that the question of whether and how altering the legal meaning of marriage from the union of male and female to a unisex union of any two persons will change the meaning of marriage itself is a critical question which serious people must take seriously and about which americans of good will may and do disagree
1033475 i think we would eliminate some but not all of the cantankerous debate on same sex marriage if we did what many of the nations in europe do which is to separate the civil aspects of marriage and the religious aspects
1033476 ive talked to over the years some conservatives who do think that is a respectable way to distinguish the sacred from the secular
1033477 france and many others who follow that tradition have appropriated to government the sole power to create marriages this is not our legal tradition at all im not especially in favor of it
1033478 a real alternative would be for government to recognize and enforce religiously distinctive marriage contracts so long as they serve the governments interest say permanent ones for catholics
1033479 but what people who talk about separating marriage and state really propose to do is simply to refuse to recognize religious marriage contracts at all this is not neutrality it is a powerful intervention by the government into the lives of religious people
1033480 everybody recognizes that you dont have to have a religious marriage state legislatures write out the rules of marriage the rights and responsibilities of this civil institution
1033481 if people have to sign documents or register before an official it in no way impugns the integrity of the religious promises that are made during a sectarian or religious ceremony the state of course has some right to set the rules for the responsibilities and rights of marriage if that were done for some couples in no way does it impinge on the rights of a church to explain marriage in its own way
1033482 it doesnt solve any of the really hard questions why is the government involved in intimate unions why can it separate out and define at all what private and personal adult relationships are worthy of special respect
1033483 if marriage even renamed civil unions has any legal shape or consequences at all the government still has to define the same question why only two people
1033484 all of their friends who had married parents had questions about why their mom and dad werent married
1033485 all of the couples were enthusiastic possibly the women more so than the men
1033486 of course one of the things that attracted them the most was the all expenses paid part
1033487 we just didnt feel we could afford the kind of wedding we wanted to have
1033488 there is less of a chance for a lawsuit to go ahead and act
1033489 eu e mariana temos qu mica uma dupla que deu certo hipocrisia dizer que n o mas algu m j me viu terminar algum relacionamento assim se eu n o fosse fiel eu j teria me separado eu j me envolvi com algum par rom ntico ent o me d licen a
1033490 desculpa falar dessa maneira mas detesto que fiquem fazendo esse tipo de insinua o
1033491 n s j gravamos algumas cenas agora acho que ele vai se envolver ali s do halley pode se esperar tudo acredito que v ficar um romance meio que quadrangular n a c u a lara o halley e o cassiano que o thiago rodrigues faz muito bem me dou muito bem com ele em cena
1033492 ah gente normal ter um pouco de ci mes n mas isso faz parte da nossa profiss o daqui a pouco ela vai estar beijando o
1033493 wed both just started jobs and i was kind of skeptical at first but im so glad we went ahead and did it
1033494 it was an awesome chance to invest in ourselves and in our future and in the future of our marriage the topics were so applicable
1033495 what were trying to do is use the family institution as not only the greatest evangelism tool but also the greatest discipleship tool
1033496 we had folks who just needed premarital counseling so we launched a class of five couples
1033497 we tried to find curriculum that would meet our needs and was interactive that really got couples working through issues and talking
1033498 i think if it were smaller we would have missed out on a lot but it wasnt so big that you didnt have a chance to contribute to the group
1033499 the time we spent preparing for the lessons and the time we spent sitting down with the group was the most valued and cherished part of the week
1033500 theyre all the conversations married couples ought to have and often have 10 to 15 years into the marriage but were introducing them on the front end
1033501 the majority of folks look to get married in either a church or synagogue and they look to the church for guidance and direction
1033502 weve made it fun weve made it interactive its appealing to young couples whore really desiring to know what theyre getting themselves into
1033503 the best thing is that a lot of the couples are not a part of our church
1033504 with hundreds of thousands of dollars of big oil money lining gordon smiths campaign coffers its no wonder he thinks they deserve billions in special tax breaks
1033505 they are attacking smith for taking 300 000 from big oil but according to opensecrets org the dscc has taken over 458 000 from big oil this cycle
1033506 gordon smith is my friend but the problem is that when its come time to vote in the senate hes been a much better friend of george bush voting with george bush ninety percent of the time just isnt good for the people and issues ive fought for over a lifetime
1033507 have you tried the remedies question i think its 6 requiring only trust remedies for the answer yuck
1033508 gl ria perez em que interpreta a indiana maya o melhor mesmo ser levar o marido com ela
1033509 its a film that is just rewriting the record books every day and redefining our notions of what a blockbuster can be
1033510 the movie has grown in terms of its base audience from primarily what was conceived as a young male movie to a movie for everybody from 8 to 80
1033511 theyre going to see it because of the reviews theyre going to see it because of the word of mouth theyre going just to see what its all about and they all like it
1033512 it looked like we could do somewhere between 45 and 50 million but no one could have foreseen the juggernaut the dark knight has become
1033513 spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing
1033514 people concerned about their weight have the incentive and ability to inform themselves about the number of calories that they consume
1033515 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1033516 i made a general point about the fact that we need to provide the american people some relief and that there has been constructive conversations between republicans and democrats in the senate on this issue
1033517 what i will not do and this has always been my position is to support a plan that suggests this drilling is the answer to our energy problems
1033518 if weve got a plan on the table that i think meets the goals that america has to set and there are some things in there that i dont like then obviously thats something that i would consider because thats the nature of how we govern in a democracy
1033519 when im president i intend to keep in place the moratorium here in florida and around the country that prevents oil companies from drilling off floridas coasts
1033520 thats how we can protect our coastline and still make the investments that will reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for good
1033521 its not going to provide short term relief or medium term relief or in fact long term relief it wont drop prices in this administration or in the next administration or in the administration after that
1033522 the republicans and the oil companies have been really beating the drums on drilling
1033523 and so we dont want gridlock we want to get something done
1033524 its clear that members of both parties are following john mccains leadership toward an all of the above approach on energy that includes nuclear alternative energy and offshore drilling
1033525 the president has failed in his economic policy and now he wants to say but for drilling in protected areas offshore our economy would be thriving and the price of gas would be lower
1033526 that hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to relieve the pain of consumers at the pump and to promote energy independence
1033527 there is a fundamental physics issue we can no longer get around
1033528 if we kept going as we had been the heat density on a chip would have equaled the surface of the sun
1033529 man of unique destiny whose name will remain in russias history
1033530 he was one of the first people who spoke up about the inhumanity of stalins regime with a full voice and about the people whose lived through this but were not broken
1033531 the death of alexander isayevich solzhenitsyn is a heavy loss for the whole of russia
1033532 it was obviously a big disappointment not to reach orbit on this flight 3 of the falcon 1
1033533 for my part i will never give up and i mean never
1033534 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1033535 a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate
1033536 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets
1033537 barack obamas latest attack ads shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy
1033538 after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1033539 received information that they were being arrested by hamas and that their lives were in immediate danger
1033540 when a man stands between two choices to be killed by his people or to be arrested by his enemy and he reaches a conclusion that it is better to be arrested by his enemy it shows you how cruel the situation is in gaza
1033541 the guards have recently tested a naval weapon which i can say with certainty that the enemys ships would not be safe within the range of 300 kilometers
1033542 without any doubt we will send them to the depths of the sea
1033543 we will take part in any negotiations and talk about any issue which consolidates our nuclear rights
1033544 i hear that girls suffer not just physically but psychologically
1033545 but i am afraid i dont want my daughters to have uncontrollable demands for sex
1033546 i dont care what everyone thinks i was really harmed and i didnt want this for my daughters
1033547 when i talk about my experience many become convinced they also see how my daughters are good and religious
1033548 it is something we have grown up with and our ancestors have done
1033549 maybe i am 70 percent for not doing it part of my change of heart is talking with fatma and others
1033550 sixteen years after brett favre came to the packers he is returning for a seventeenth season
1033551 frankly bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
1033552 theres been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down communicate theres some things we need to go through and the information that comes out of that will be used to move forward in the decision
1033553 this was the goal from day 1 to play for the packers
1033554 but you have to have a plan that has the ability to adjust were doing that bretts path here has been different but hes earned the right he wants to play football he should be allowed to play football i dont have any problem with that but i just want to make sure hes clear on the direction our football team has gone before we move forward
1033555 bretts change of mind put us in a very difficult spot
1033556 we now will revise many actions and assumptions about our long term future all predicated on bretts decision last march to retire as a result of his decision we invested considerably in a new and different future without brett and we were obviously moving in that direction thats why this wasnt easy having crossed the rubicon once when brett decided to retire its very difficult to reorient our plans and cross it again in the opposite direction but well put this to our advantage
1033557 favre probably did a little more throwing this offseason than previous years
1033558 he started a little later but youll see hes still got that arm he even said he can still make all the throws
1033559 he couldnt do that deal hed been working this long to come back and that was his goal
1033560 flextor is in essentially the same business as our effox subsidiary
1033561 we intend to operate these two companies together as one operational entity
1033562 the acquisition of flextor fits in with our goal of expanding our international business
1033563 the acquisition of avc increases our traditionally high margin parts business

1033566 someday soon youll be staying home with mommy babe i promise im sorry
1033567 exclusive brad and angelina share their beautiful family with us
1033568 dean and sammy were like watching a stand up routine during takes
1033569 they had us busting up between takes and there was always this card game that roger moore always wanted me to play i spent a lot of time on that set
1033570 i wouldnt say it was intimidating working with them but its tough when you are crossing boundaries i had worked with burt in hooper what you find is they rapidly endorse you over here acting not because of your acting skills but because they respected you as an athlete and eventually pull you in
1033571 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries occurred from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive this is usually from the lowest order or the edge of the pool
1033572 this really suggests the need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risk of diving related injuries
1033573 theres a lot that can be done to make diving a safer recreational activity or sport
1033574 having a lifeguard or other supervision present is really important
1033575 what is most interesting to me as a pediatrician with a mind for prevention is what may also be among the most predictable findings of the study that diving injury peaks substantially during the summer months and that boys are far more likely to be injured than girls
1033576 the summer month exposure will surprise no one males are more affected by nearly all types of injury particularly unintentional injury
1033577 we tend to teach children well to stay in the shallow end when they are small
1033578 we do less of a good job teaching about the risks of diving or marking dive safe zones as they grow
1033579 my appreciation of the numbers was quite hopeless given my age and my level of experience in the city i wouldnt have thought that i would be so out of touch with reality
1033580 it sounds an awful thing to say but i know people i went to school with and ive no idea how they survive on the incomes they have
1033581 the goose that lays the golden egg is the people who come to london to make wealth
1033582 a reflection of the success of policies here making the city one of the pre eminent financial centres of the world
1033583 i dont think we should sit here and say london should be guilty for being successful
1033584 its a fact of modern life that there is disparity and is it fair or unfair is not a valid question its just the way it is and you have to get on with it people say its unfair when they dont do anything to change their circumstances
1033585 quite a lot of people have done well who want to achieve and quite a lot of people havent done well because they dont want to achieve
1033586 if you aspire to anything beyond that youre not going to live there any more and thats the choice you make
1033587 some of these are vocational things like nurses its accepted they go into it knowing that thats part of the deal
1033588 many people like teachers dont do things for the pay but you wont find a teacher that works as hard as we do
1033589 i do enjoy the fact i can have nice holidays and dont think twice about buying particular items
1033590 im sick of this because with 100 000 in manchester you are well off 100 000 is a not a wealthy person down here
1033591 we now live in a separate economy we live on a separate level to the vast majority of people in the country we dont send our kids to the same schools we have more choice over schools we have more choice over health we have more choice over where we live we have more choice over where we go on holiday and what we do for our jobs and we live in a completely different world to the people we live next door to
1033592 i work hard ive got two boys and i want to provide for them
1033593 i really object because what it does is take the whole emphasis and focus away into something thats totally irrelevant and wont help a poor person at all
1033594 all kinds of bullshit crap which doesnt help the people
1033595 people dont starve in this country its ok compared with other countries here you dont go hungry because you can just go and get money for free
1033596 say 3 000 a month in their hands and theyre somewhere miles up north theyre not going to earn that sort of money so wheres the incentive for them to go out to work
1033597 single people get pregnant and get a flat and more money you just see everybody pushing prams then theyll get more income and a little flat that they can stay in for life
1033598 doesnt get that much less money than another 18 year old working in a shop
1033599 this thing of giving pregnant women 200 for dietary supplements like as if theyll really spend it on fruit
1033600 we dont think just chucking money at the welfare state is the answer
1033601 lack of ability is the main basis on which you get a job
1033602 nobody in the public sector is actually trained to do the job that theyre required to do
1033603 labour did a bit of that with extra taxes and windfall taxes and the famous raid on pensions the big debate is about how effectively all that money raising has been applied most people would say not all of it was well applied
1033604 i have absolutely no idea how my taxes are spent and therefore i do not trust the system at all
1033605 the classic is how much you pay in your taxation versus whats invested in the roads and the transport system it goes into a black hole
1033606 little accountability and measurability in the way that tax is actually used
1033607 say all we need to say about the waste and futility of public spending
1033608 i want to talk about what charity can do for us
1033609 what do you do now youve got all the toys
1033610 youve already got all the houses yachts cars and jets you can use so what comes next is charity
1033611 i get invited to places id never have seen otherwise
1033612 if we can apply the entrepreneurial principles we have brought to business to charity we have a shot at having a really strong impact to be able to transform the lives of children
1033613 the general feeling is a lot of cynicism about whether or not if you do give the cash its going to get where you want it to go

1033624 he is not retiring we have plans to relocate within the village currently looking at a few vacant stores within the area marc my words that marc jacobs and all others alike will not last in greenwich village in a few years many of those stores will be vacant
1033625 residents are calling the community board 6 office to say that
1033626 the key issue being dealt with now regarding this first wave of mosquitoes is the annoyance factor lots of mosquitoes and lots of mosquito bites
1033627 however as time passes those species of mosquitoes more likely to transmit disease begin to breed in the standing water that remains
1033628 local state and federal officials are coordinating on where when and what to spray
1033629 this is a regional approach with county and city health departments one of the things were doing now is surveillance to determine and document mosquito activity
1033630 chemical applications are being done by ground by the area entities involved
1033631 the spraying is being done in the early morning or late evening when the mosquitoes are most active local entities are implementing control efforts and our department is providing leadership and technical assistance
1033632 were on top of this problem and are working in the interest of public health
1033633 the department of state health service is coordinating efforts locally and trying to identify the supplies and treatments for the most effective insect vector control possible
1033634 we want the public to know what were doing and to let them know what they can do to protect themselves and eliminate mosquito breeding conditions
1033635 people who need to leave their doors and windows open should make sure their screens are repaired and in good condition
1033636 they can also protect themselves by wearing long pants and long sleeved shirts using a repellent with deet and by judicious use of over the counter mosquito control products of course its important they read and follow all labeling instructions
1033637 some of the items people may want to investigate for water thats been standing for a while include flower pots dog bowls bird baths old tires basins and clogged gutters anything that can catch and hold water
1033638 even standing water in bottles and cans will breed mosquitoes
1033639 after a few weeks if standing water remains different types of mosquitoes typically breed in that water he said
1033640 disease transmitting species of aedes and culex mosquitoes are stagnant water breeders and these are more typically associated with west nile virus and st louis encephalitis so its very important that people eliminate these potential breeding sites
1033641 this rate reduction will give a bit of additional assistance to our drought stricken ranchers in western north dakota

1033660 there is a possibility that the suspect did have bias against transgender women
1033661 regardless of whether those formal charges are filed its important to notice that these type of crimes affect the gay lesbian and transgender community
1033662 a prosecutor is going to talk about this being a knowing killing that the defendant knew what he was doing the defense is going to argue that it was the heat of passion that he did it because he the defendant was so upset for being duped
1033663 this is not a classic hate crime where an individual is beaten to death because of their orientation this is a case when an individual reacted irrationally and unlawfully to learning they had been fooled

1033708 we find that oil that is expected to reach the market some years hence has an immediate impact on oil prices
1033709 if oil firms were allowed to drill in anwr and many of the other areas that are currently off limits to oil production it is possible that these areas together might have a significant impact on world oil prices
1033710 your main result the present impact of an anticipated future supply change is already known to economists
1033711 was there along with several local officials and members of the local media
1033712 there are 1 4 million people in favor of drilling here drilling now and pay less

1033718 normally i do the album artwork myself however for this album i wanted to do something different martin had mentioned to me a while back that he painted so i asked him if he wouldnt mind doing something for the album and he came up with something in no time i really wanted something a little more abstract to match the theme of the album and i think martin captured what i was looking for perfectly
1033719 since todays press conference the collingwood football club has established that alan didak was in fact a passenger in heath shaws car on sunday night
1033720 the sanction imposed on heath by the club on monday was a result of information stated by both heath and alan after being repeatedly questioned about the incident
1033721 given the club has now found their information to be false it strikes at the principles of honesty and integrity that the collingwood football club is built on for this reason the sanction imposed today will be immediately reviewed by the club and media will be notified of a press conference to be held today
1033722 simply put alan has been put on notice as of today
1033723 that without pre empting the outcome it is very likely they a breach would have an immediate and ultimate outcome on the termination of alans contract alan is very clear from this meeting that it will be a turning point in his career in either direction clear lines have been drawn in the sand
1033724 right now the way im feeling is that if we played a game right now against st kilda and the st kilda boys roughed him up and were into him at the first bounce im not too sure if id be over there to support him to tell you the truth youve done it you cop it

1033731 it was a bit unbelievable and seemed to take security five minutes to get out there he could have done anything to fuifui its pretty scary
1033732 we did have that lull we got ahead and then we slackened off a bit
1033733 theres plenty of enthusiasm in the side but we need mental toughness to grind out the win for the whole game
1033734 i dont think we were totally dominant i thought we lost our way a few times but we did enough to win and enough to show were getting better
1033735 im a bit cautious about that boost at making the eight theres absolutely no prize for being in the eight after 21 round
1033736 if we had the answer to that wed be much higher on the ladder
1033737 we came out with some errors that applied a lot of pressure to ourselves and were not able to hold teams out
1033738 but at no point on the field do any of the boys out there on the field give up obviously that last try was disappointing but theres guys out there busting their arse for the whole 80 minutes
1033739 it wasnt the ideal way to come back to your former club but in the end you dont get to write those scripts either
1033740 a lot of our major sponsors contracts are up at the end of 08 so were in the process of talking to all those people
1033741 the timing of sonnys walkout isnt ideal and its certainly not making things any easier
1033742 we have discussed things with his agents and we are going to try and complete the move
1033743 if everything goes well he will have his medical on tuesday and could make his debut in a friendly match on friday
1033744 im obviously disappointed to learn of this through the media reports
1033745 its not a setback hes over there and getting ready so its obviously all part of the plan
1033746 theres no doubt in my view hes still one year into a five year deal and i think that needs to be banged home pretty strongly
1033747 id like to think when the times are a little tough the sponsors are going to stick with us
1033748 ive said a number of times the club will come out the other end and we want to hope as many of our sponsors and supporters stick with us through the tough times
1033749 were working at speed with the nrl and our respective legal teams to determine our next steps
1033750 i spoke to a few of the mates ive played against over the years to try and get their take on it coming from different countries
1033751 i hope to get in touch with a few of the indian guys but those i have spoken to are all totally convinced and supportive of it
1033752 the key message from a cricket point of view is the games health and longevity in the next 50 and 100 years im very passionate about it the olympic push and i think theres a lot of evidence to suggest it should be considered seriously
1033753 i suppose this is a bit of a call to arms for the games administrators
1033754 i think player support is going to be as strong a message as anything because its not going to mean much if players arent in support of it
1033755 the olympics would be the greatest vehicle to spread the game worldwide and it would be a logical fit
1033756 when you think of the olympics you also think of the big nations like the us russia and now china
1033757 those regions are clearly potential growth opportunities for cricket and we see twenty20 at the olympics as a superb vehicle
1033758 the best chance weve learned is with a different city and given that were talking 20 to 30 years before we could do it again i think a lot will come down to how brisbane develops in terms of further infrastructure hotels and whatever by then
1033759 i couldnt and wouldnt say to the queensland government or the brisbane city council to go out and build a new swimming pool but infrastructure is important villages in the past have been around university sites for instance it would be smart to at least have somewhere in mind but certainly i wouldnt be counselling them to go building anything because what you build now would be outdated by then
1033760 my view is that this is something brisbane should throw its hat in the ring for
1033761 it is a 10 15 years thing and something we would have to work through
1033762 there are significant issues with brisbanes infrastructure apart from sporting infrastructure hotel roads public transport and water infrastructure needs would have to be addressed
1033763 im very positive about this and quite pleased that john coates has the confidence that brisbane could stage a future olympics
1033764 its very very expensive to build for an olympic games now because of the added security element
1033765 we were 300 million in sydney by the time it went to the athens games it was 1 6billion plus whatever fleet of the us navy was sitting off the coast and i imagine london is also having to spend big

1033818 then i saw blogs telling me they were under investigation and i realised we werent the only ones caught in the same trap
1033819 that site has been up for nearly 12 months my view was that if it was dodgy the ioc would have closed it down a long time ago
1033820 well be working with our international agency contacts throughout the world providing them with whatever information that we can but im afraid to say australians are just among the large number of those internationally who have been caught by the scam
1033821 when you see the map it becomes radically apparent just how firmly britain was the root of the industrial revolution
1033822 i know it is sometimes thought that we who believe the baptism of infants to be a heresy neglect our children but could there have been a greter slander why instead thereof we think we are doing our children the greatest service that we can possibly do them when teaching them that they are not members of christs church that they are not made christians in the day that they are christened that they must be born again and that that new birth must be in them a thing which they can consciously realize and not a thing we can do for them in their babyhood while they are yet in their long clothes by sprinkling a handful of water in their faces we think they are far more likely to be converted than those who are brought up in the delusive notion taught them in that expression of the catechism a most wicked blasphemous and false expression a child of god an inheritor of the kingdom of heaven
1033823 in my baptism wherein i was made a member of christ the pope of rome never uttered a sentence more unholy than that never said a syllable more contradictory to the whole tenor of gods word children are not saved by baptism but the baptism precedes not the belief nor doth it co act or co work in our salvation for salvation is a work of grace laid hold of by faith and faith alone baptized or unbaptized if you believe you are saved and our children dying in their infancy without any unhallowed or superstitious rite are saved notwithstanding
1033824 will blogs take over the world of reporting and cause readers to turn to them instead of their local newspapers
1033825 combat the issue is for newspapers to simply start reporting better
1033826 the popularity of blogs will slowly diminish and newspapers will again come out on top
1033827 he has obviously been ticking all the boxes from a medical point of view and he is from a physical point of view training very hard to keep himself in the sort of condition that would allow him to train from the outset
1033828 ben has had an association with our football club through his father bryan who was a past great and our football family would like to stick together and offer our support to the cousins family
1033829 if canberra sack todd im on the understanding the nrl would probably support canberra which means he would not be registered by another nrl club
1033830 as i said to him its all hypothetical because todd wants to stay in canberra and canberra want to keep him hopefully
1033831 thats the plan and thats what were all working on so it shouldnt be an issue anyway
1033832 hes requested that he gets the chance to put his side to the board
1033833 the bottom line is todd wants to be at the club the club wants todd
1033834 todd has to address some behavioural issues and well work through that
1033835 it may or may not go down that path im not going in with a preconceived idea it will go down that path so its all hypothetical at the moment
1033836 we havent said he wouldnt cop it anyway it was just the process thats all we were talking about

1033843 trendy the diaries participants accounted cause how bureaucracy sapped their aeon
1033844 why would a loving god let bad things happen to good people why would god only provide one way to heaven why would god bless some people groups while other groups suffer with poverty and disease why do christians feel they are the only ones with all the right answers
1033845 there are people in the world so hungry that god cannot appear to them except in the form of bread

1033850 if my people who are called by my name humble themselves pray and seek my face and turn from their evil ways then i will hear from heaven forgive their sin and heal their land

1033871 most humans try to control their environment many times we do so with our words we use what we say or how we say it to control our environment sometimes this is okay but if we always try to control our environment then we do not allow god to work things out according to his will
1033872 sometimes when i am thinking or feeling something and i want to express it without becoming vulnerable to judgement i will say it sarcastically or as a joke

1033886 just dont make a mockery of the whole thing treat it seriously as we do we love these characters to see them doing things and saying things that would be well unnatural would be unseemly if you know what i mean
1033887 i will treat these characters with as much respect as i can muster

1033896 i think that the relationship with china is one that weve been cultivating and improving for some time now and my appointment certainly does not get in the way of that but i dont think its a signal of any profound change in foreign policy
1033897 you need to have the prime ministers direct engagement that is where the key problem is
1033898 harper is not committing to visiting china any time soon
1033899 why everybody else other heads of state of g8 are visiting china are engaging china for improving chinas human rights for improving economic relations to promote jobs and investments and our prime minister is not doing so

1033928 everybody that comes into israel we have to question them about the reason they are coming especially if they are in a terror organisation
1033929 these people are not going to assist us because the moment they come back to gaza they are already suspected of being collaborators
1033930 we do not waste time and effort on people who cannot help us
1033931 we dont question that israel has to protect itself and that maybe it needs to find out something about a person who wants to enter our problem is that they are questioning patients about other people
1033932 you are not allowed to use civilians as part of the conflict

1033934 they were then picked up by army helicopter from base camp this morning and have now been shifted to hospital for treatment for severe frostbite
1033935 his condition is not good he has some bruises and frostbite and exhaustion

1033945 as the fight against aids nears the end of its third decade we are still facing a huge shortfall in resources
1033946 the responses to hiv and aids require long term and sustained financing as more people go on treatment and live longer budgets will have to increase considerably over the next few decades in the most affected countries donors will have to provide the majority of the funding
1033947 we dare not let down our guard this is an unforgiving epidemic
1033948 we are going to be in this for the long haul
1033949 every day almost three times as many people become newly infected with hiv as those who start taking antiretroviral therapy
1033950 many of us want to be doctors or teachers i want to be a singer but these dreams will only be possible when we have medicines when were accepted in schools and when we can grow up in an atmosphere free from violence stigma and discrimination
1033951 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
1033952 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
1033953 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
1033954 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
1033955 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better
1033956 in the emerging markets where hsbc is the leading international bank growth remained strong in the period as real asset prices continued to rise and infrastructure development continued to boost economic growth which supported consumer confidence and spending

1033998 you really should be less naive than to take the word of a breed idr who achieved their status on a four hour training course i have been identifying these dogs for many years and im afraid to say that that animal is no turtle its not even got a turtles head the fact is there is no such thing as a turtle without a shell a turtles shell is a fundamental fixture of the animal
1033999 whilst i agree it is not a perfect pit bull but it is one
1034000 what i mean by perfect pit bull is that this particular one lacks some key pit characteristics it doesnt have a red nose for a start in fact it doesnt seem to have a nose at all which makes it somewhat less than perfect also if you look closely at the animals rump and chest you will see no evidence of where the animal would have been pulling 18 tonne weighted carriages most pit bulls tend to do this on a semi regular basis certainly the perfect pit bulls do i believe that the animal we are looking at is in fact a pit bull just not a perfect one
1034001 ive never seen this dog but i think it probably is a pit bull id recommend it be put down

1034030 if your presence does not go with us do not send us up from here
1034031 how reflection can be so different from the true image
1034032 i will welcome death i welcome it in the night in its true form in the dark
1034033 face me for i will do it again if i have to i will not step down from my choice i will not back away from the consequences and i will face what has to be faced i am lanfear daughter of the night and queen of those who believe in the true nature of darkness
1034034 i have not changed i have shed off the skin that was buried under a mask and i see myself now
1034035 mierin i hear youve been looking up our old friends why did you not look me up
1034036 i was not planning on leaving you out duram you know me better than that
1034037 i hear you want to know what drove us to join the pact
1034038 you are one of us nothing can change that not your hunt passed all of us not the torture of the weaklings or the manipulation of the stronger
1034039 that is how you see it my view is different i need to know what happened and why we made the decision to follow him
1034040 i understand but remember that the great lord has not lost he has merely retreated and he has his prize as you well know
1034041 deal with it and stop looking up old friends as if they are your enemies
1034042 it was not you it was not that i feared your retaliation if i had
1034043 the circle is complete we stand here together as one and none can say that our strength was not tested today
1034044 i found you why would i not find others as well
1034045 you should never have allowed her to become a warder much less bond a green aes sedai
1034046 she was used as bait by the witch who controlled her
1034047 it was not a question of bait she did her job she was well trained
1034048 no she was not i remember her promotion quite well i was there you see she was so young
1034049 the dark side has always lingered in the tower and among the darkfriends who protect our sisters there
1034050 the tower is no more what does it matter now
1034051 it means that we have won in the end maybe the great lord is not here to see his victory or to celebrate with us but we have won
1034052 you know so little and yet you pretend to know so much and to be so much my pet i can appreciate that but do not drive it to the point where your ignorance is your knowledge
1034053 you dont know enough to say anything my pet the great lord cant die and he is definitely not defeated he has retreated to let us do his work for him
1034054 we have won and the world will soon know our power for what it is
1034055 then kill me now for i do not wish to see a world where darkness rules
1034056 no i shall not my pet i need someone to keep me company while i wait for my lord to come to me and tell me what he wants me to do he has promised me that
1034057 i want you to be able to say goodbye to her
1034058 they are all dead as is the person i want you to see
1034059 here we are i think she was here when i left this place
1034060 i understand if you hate me for doing this she was yours and you should be able to say a proper goodbye
1034061 just so you know it was not me who killed her i found her like this when she was already gone
1034062 yes she came back to help her sedai the woman had lost her other two warders already
1034063 they will pay and he will know the price of his betrayal to the great lord he will pay the price for all of our betrayal all of us together will find the answer and will ask for mercy when he returns
1034064 i do not use that name anymore lillen you should have remembered
1034065 the spider came out of her web and failed in her task thus she retreated to the darkest corner of the house she called her home
1034066 if you do not use your name then let me keep mine moghedien
1034067 alright tell me what you know tell me what i want to know
1034068 i cant tell you more than you already know lanfear
1034069 i want to know why you followed him why you did not stop him when he suggested we go against the great lord
1034070 tell me i shall not be able to leave before you tell me
1034071 it was our betrayal you were there you know what happened and that we had no choice i only followed you and the others i had no choice of my own in the matter
1034072 even a lesser darkfriend with no hope of surviving has the choice to die in dignity we all have a choice and we made the wrong one
1034073 i wonder if you even think for yourself at least for once in your life you should try it be amazed at the power of your own mind
1034074 people are returning to the city but too many are dead to say that there is real activity
1034075 i do not know my power does not go to those who use the one power
1034076 i came because i heard some rumor about you wanting to know what we did i understand that you have your doubts but you cannot doubt that you were involved yourself
1034077 you heard correct in that i have sought for the answer to the question what we did and moreover why we did it
1034078 you always choose the simplest of throne rooms when you roam the world mierin i wonder why that is
1034079 lets get to the point i want to help you together we can form a new alliance a new plan can be made and we can bring them to their knees for what they did
1034080 no we cannot say they were the ones who did what we all did we were involved as you said yourself
1034081 with the right tools we can make them believe our version of the truth
1034082 what do you mean our version there is no need for a new version all we need to do is find a way to free him after what we did he will want us dead no matter how far we run or how deep we bury ourselves in this our truth talk he will find us and he will seek his revenge there is one man guilty for rowing us up and once i have him well see who gets to live and who gets to meet his lord before his time
1034083 that said you are allowed to change your offer and help me nonetheless
1034084 i have felt a balance here or rather something that was off balance i believe even you can feel it someone channeled here

1034239 the demise of the lisbon treaty would not be a catastrophe but europeans would still be much better off with the lisbon treaty
1034240 eu governments would then try to salvage the few parts of the lisbon treaty that could be implemented without its ratification
1034241 the eu governments could use the croatian accession treaty expected in a couple of years to help their salvage operation all accession treaties have to adjust eu voting rules but they are not normally put to referendum at the moment france and germany say they will block further enlargement until the lisbon treaty is ratified but that line would probably change if croatian accession offered the chance to save parts of lisbon evidently the eu could not credibly use an accession treaty to transfer powers from the member states to the eu for example through more majority voting but an accession treaty could introduce the double majority voting rule and create the new high representative
1034242 such use of an accession treaty would be politically controversial and eu leaders would haggle over the contents but if lisbon was dead they would not want to negotiate a new treaty from scratch and they would see the arrival of the croats as an opportunity
1034243 ireland like the rest of the europe does not hold referendums on eu enlargement treaties and with new protocol opt outs dublin may be able to get a new accession treaty past the irish parliament without another popular vote
1034244 most eu governments would wish to avoid further referendums and would ratify this by parliamentary vote eurosceptics would demand referendums complaining that arrogant politicians were again building the eu behind the backs of the people the governments should face down such demands pointing out that the constitutional treaty and the overwhelming majority of its provisions had been abandoned they should explain that the new mini treaty was about technical adjustments to make the eu work better rather than transfers of new powers to the eu

1034281 everyone can make a contribution to that goal and at the grassroots level there are some very unique individuals who do do their part wayne maracle is one of those with his culturing of young walleye

1034292 i noticed that they wanted to rebuild the lobster cooker with personalized bricks
1034293 i thought you know it might be a long ways off but would be a good surprising way to propose to her by personalizing the brick asking her to marry me
1034294 it all worked out and i kept my mouth shut which is surprising
1034295 the proposal to me is as permanent as the structure and thats how i feel

1034310 we cant avoid our responses to things and think theyll go away if the son of god needs to let it out if jesus wept then we do to

1034326 a disciple doesnt just want to know what the rabbi knows a disciple wants to be like the rabbi and wants to learn to do what the rabbi does
1034327 different rabbis had different sets of interpretations about how they lived out and understood and interpreted the scriptures
1034328 if theyre fishermen and jesus calls them to be his disciples then they are not following another rabbi and if theyre not following another rabbi theyre not the best of the best they didnt make the cut
1034329 now i always assumed that peter doubts jesus but jesus isnt sinking who does peter doubt he doubts himself he loses faith in himself that he can actually be like his rabbi

1034334 people whose hearts are beating more and more like gods
1034335 alot of people confuse religion with god and walk away from them both the point isnt christianity the point is being a christian it means being a follower of jesus its being connected with everything thats true and good and right everything that goes on around us that reminds us that there is so much more going on around us than we realise

1034348 i thought i need to holster and grab a taser and i knew i didnt have time
1034349 i thought about holstering it but i didnt want him to grab my hand with the gun in my hand i even thought about tossing it and going hands on but i couldnt see his hands
1034350 he just expletive came so expletive fast i dont even remember putting my expletive finger on the trigger i just remembered hearing shots and he kept coming he kept coming and by the time he dropped he was on the street
1034351 when i came to the scene i didnt think he was armed
1034352 that was my frame of mind hes probably not armed hes probably going to run and im going to have to run after him and grab him
1034353 it was dark i didnt turn my flashlight on and im just listening
1034354 and i could hear trees rustling and i couldnt tell where it was coming from
1034355 maybe that was from him walking down the steep hill his hands were jerking
1034356 i withdrew my gun because i heard the bottle break
1034357 when i heard the glass i was like man do i really need to pull my gun out its like thats what i was trained to do
1034358 i had pictured somebody shoving an expletive bottle in expletive in my neck or something
1034359 so i started yelling again trying to break his train of thought
1034360 he started flailing and coming right at me and it was like what the expletive are you doing
1034361 i just remember backing up and he was just expletive he was just expletive flying he closed that gap so expletive quick
1034362 i think i started shooting somewhere in between the cars and i kept firing until he stopped
1034363 i seen a bulging in his sweatshirt and i thought it was like the tip of a gun and i went to touch it and it felt like an expletive round
1034364 some guy came out he was saying something i had no idea what he was saying i dont even remember what i was saying i couldnt believe what just happened i didnt want to shoot anybody i came to the call thinking maybe id have to chase somebody
1034365 i would have roughed him up and i would have dropped him on his back i know im capable of that i can probably take almost anybody to the ground ive been wrestling since i was 6 years old i know how to take somebody down its not a problem for me
1034366 what was scaring me was i couldnt see his hands and the bottle that was broken i didnt want to get stabbed i didnt want to get cut
1034367 when was the first time you were able to see his left hand
1034368 even when he was on the ground i didnt see his hands
1034369 at my age gaining first team experience is of paramount importance and thats why ive come to leicester

1034615 nowhere in his hysterical attack on me does he address the specifics of how he and i disagree on the topic of melissa leos diva tantrum
1034616 because you brought the subject up ryan lets compare awardsdaily com and theenvelope com in terms of covering showbiz awards over the last few months ok theenvelope com has more detailed emmy info than any media source on the planet we broke the katherine heigl story over the last few weeks also i leaked the top 10 semifinalist lists before nominations came out for a third year in a row ive done that by the way we also were the first media source to reveal what episodes are being viewed by emmy judges thats the most important emmy information of all because thats how winners are chosen what emmy scoops did awardsdaily com break ryan

1034636 the one thing that i wasnt keen on here was metallica plugging into a modern war or a current event that might be construed as some sort of political statement on our part
1034637 there are so many celebrities that soapbox their opinions and people believe its more valid because theyre popular for us people are people you should all have your own opinion we are hopefully putting the human element in what is an unfortunate part of life there are people over there dealing with situations like this and were showing the human part of being there
1034638 the main theme of the video is the human element of forgiveness
1034639 someone doing you wrong you feeling resentment and you being able to see through that in the next situation that might be similar and not take your rage or resentment out on the next person and basically keep spreading the disease of that through life
1034640 its the forgiveness part that is key metallica has never plugged into any current event visually but this one is kind of a hotbed people have very high opinions about this war and were trying to cut through all of that the politics and the religion tend to separate people and what were trying to do is bring it together with the common thread of resentment and forgiveness
1034641 dont label me this that or the next thing im not jumping on the band wagon
1034642 now i cannot say that violence never wins any victories it occasionally wins victories nations often receive their independence through the use of violence but i can say this that that is all it does violence only achieves temporary victory but it never can achieve ultimate peace it creates many more social problems than it solves and violence ends up defeating itself

1034652 we need to look at forests through fresh eyes prof mackay said
1034653 the policy can no longer be blind to the green carbon thats in these natural forests he said

1034655 the key finding here is that this is ascorbic acid used as a drug and it appears to have some promise in treating some cancers

1034730 the challenge we face is that while the requirement for ground combat forces will diminish we will still have large numbers of mobile training teams out with iraqi forces doing their mission
1034731 if they get in trouble air power will have to increasingly fill the role of a quick response force there simply wont be the numbers of ground combat troops to make that guarantee

1034756 i constantly marvel at how bill iwocpo and his disciples at abel to yzerman can be so pompous and full of themselves throughout every regular season but come playoff time they collapse into wavering puddles of stress and nervousness as they anxiously await the impending and unavoidable collapse of the red wings in the post season

1034770 the orbit of steins with which rosetta will rendezvous on 5 september closing to a distance of 800 km is only known thanks to ground observations but not yet with the accuracy we would like for the close fly by
1034771 we will be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1034772 for the first three weeks of the campaign however only the powerful eyes of osiris will actually be able to spot the asteroid which will look only like a dot in the sky
1034773 starting 11 days before closest approach as the distance with steins decreases the two rosetta navigation cameras will finally be able to see and track the asteroid too
1034774 we will already be able to use the first data set for the trajectory correction manoeuvre planned for mid august
1034775 as rosettas distance from steins decreases the precision of the measurements for steins orbit will increase even further allowing us the best possible trajectory corrections later on before closest approach especially in early september
1034776 but osiris will also take this opportunity to obtain light curves of steins light curves tell us how the asteroid brightness varies with time providing us with additional preparatory information about the asteroid such as better knowledge of its shape and rotation characteristics
1034777 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
1034778 if you accuse us we are going to say that you too together with willy brandt you have been involved in this conspiracy
1034779 you say that the secret armies do not exist anymore but during 1990s secret meeting in the autumn you the french were also present dont say that this doesnt exist anymore
1034780 i have kept informed for 30 years and i have never heard about these criminal armies the muslims are attacking us this is why we fight against them
1034781 the prisoners cannot be deprived of a lawyer or defence
1034782 you want gas you want oil very well in exchange we want this and that
1034783 yes i am afraid to know that these lies make people suffer yes i am afraid to think that there is less oil left yes i am afraid to think that this terrorism they talk about is the consequence of manipulations but i will not let myself become intimidated
1034784 they are good friends wed better not fight against them
1034785 i dont know why these charges were brought against my son he never stole nothing never done nothing in his life
1034786 i do feel knowing my client talking with the witnesses going out to the crime scene and doing our own private investigation that any statement that was taken from my client thats inconsistent with what hes been telling the investigators whats been telling all those involved in this case was coerced

1034800 if their father is willing to continue risking his livelihood in order to continue chopping up animals in a laboratory than his children are old enough to recognise the consequences
1034801 this guy knows what he is doing he knows that every day that he goes into the laboratory and hurts animals that it is unreasonable not to expect consequences
1034802 to put this on par with any of the human rights issues is an absolute insult to the integrity of the people who fought and went through the human rights movement
1034803 this is what people do when they have an inability to articulate their point in any constructive way they resort to primal acts of violence any reasonable person would need a logic transplant to begin to understand this level of degraded thinking
1034804 animal abusers everywhere beware we know where you live we know where you work we will never back down until you end your abuse
1034805 i question a lot about whether these people really care as much about the cause as they do about bringing notoriety to themselves

1034812 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
1034813 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
1034814 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
1034815 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
1034816 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
1034817 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
1034818 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique
1034819 at the moment we are seeking advise from zoos particularly how the public should respond to any sightings

1034826 figures such as these indicate the extent to which consumers are prepared to alter their behaviour in one way this can be seen as proof of consumer resilience in times of economic hardship it seems britons are making necessary changes to their lifestyles rather than sliding further into debt for example its encouraging to note that the total number of insolvencies in england and wales in the first quarter of 2008 was actually down more than 13 per cent on the same period a year before
1034827 worst way of reacting to financial problems is to do nothing

1034831 a distinct form of political performance action that exceeds the imagined rules of proper public speech
1034832 one of the most important political developments of our time
1034833 the genius if we may call it that of coulterism is that in playing the political game in this way it extends and rewrites the rules to trap those who most believe in them
1034834 it is not only extremely easy but also terribly tempting to dismiss coulter as a minor media made irritant a flaky extremist or just another pundit and coulter has of course been accused of deliberate distortion selective misquoting and outright falsification franken 2003 but all five of her books from her 1989 indictment of bill clinton through to godless have topped the new york times best seller list
1034835 giving up on a normative pre judgement of coulterism as clearly out of bounds or simply wrong in a moral sense
1034836 coulter wants a dirty fight perhaps we should respect her wishes
1034837 high production values the incorporating of multiple sensory modalities sight sound and touch and the ease of distribution that make the virtual temporal bone a unique learning object with tremendous potential impact in the field of medical education
1034838 with sensables technology in our system surgeons are not only learning with their eyes but also with their sense of touch
1034839 sensables open haptics software developers kit enabled us to easily integrate haptics into our application and to provide a training environment that presents a safe cost effective way to learn fundamental techniques this could be an important tool in the learning process for surgeons to develop all their senses in order to guide their surgery
1034840 this team has built a very impressive virtual environment for surgical training and we are pleased they have incorporated our phantom haptic device into the solution
1034841 we are equally proud to see their work recognized by this award

1034844 the fundamentals of our business remain solid particularly given the increased need for risk management across futures and otc markets
1034845 weve continued to grow our business substantially while generating synergies in our u s futures business and producing operating margins that reflect our disciplined approach to growth this consistently strong performance provides us with the balance sheet and cash flows necessary to execute the share repurchase program recently authorized by our board of directors even as we continue to invest for future growth this program reflects our belief that the current share price does not appropriately reflect the strong underlying fundamentals of our global business in compliance with sec rules we will begin the repurchase of shares after the creditex acquisition closes
1034846 in a world where the effect of extreme weather events is becoming more severe and the potential impact of global warming is becoming ever more apparent the met office plays an increasingly vital role in researching and forecasting these events the new supercomputer is an important step in delivering our strategic targets

1034935 target those ads based on the data we get passed through the pinch analytics package
1034936 we think the iphone is a massive opportunity and thats why we did this deal but we see applications as content and that hits our core competency right square in the center anytime we can monetize content widget content game content voice content mobile content we are interested and will prioritize based on the opportunity
1034937 this content widgets apps is essentially part of a broader page that is being served up and thats where our search engine can work with the context of that page and go beyond search to provide contextual targeting for the advertising
1034938 its all about using the right information at the right time to select the right ad
1034939 weve talked about search operator deals and our mobile ad network in terms of the partners weve signed up the next thing were going to talk about is the mobile ad network and the monetization engine that actually targets the ads all the pieces fit together and at the core its about taking inputs to develop a user profile to serve a relevant ad
1034940 the markets evolving and part of that evolution was the display component of advertising we responded by launching our mobile ad network toward the end of the last year
1034941 the less the ad is an ad and the more it becomes a value exchange with the consumer the more it is content
1034942 they are a strategic partner of ours but no where close to 40 percent
1034943 working through the channels to be able to publicize some of them soon
1034944 data and usage information to ensure only the most relevant search results are delivered as well as provide more effective ad targeting for advertisers
1034945 for us federation means one set of results from one search box and from the very beginning we focused on having one search box if you go to one of our carrier partners you will see the one search box you may see certain verticals exposed beneath that search box just to help and aid in the user education and awareness about the search experience but it really begins with that and then yes at a very most basic level it is going out and working with other partners and then a seamless aggregation into search results
1034946 we believe that over time the user wants a very simple search experience they dont necessarily care about whos federating to whom its really about providing the results theyre looking for and that includes not just the on deck content and the partners were working with thats specifically why we created a search engine that will go out and crawl the unstructured mobile web so we can pull in any website we dont have to rely on a carriers off deck partnerships to pull in xml feeds
1034947 the key is really developing mobile experiences that are relevant to whatever connectivity and or handset the individual has and thats also the challenge thats holding back the mobile industry right now
1034948 and its something that addressed in our search to index from the very beginning a unique way to bring together the relevancy of all of these sites and how they are interconnected because as you correctly pointed out the mobile web still has a lot of islands out there
1034949 the organic growth of the mobile web and better user education
1034950 users are beginning to understand a lot more about how they search for information and how they interact with the results
1034951 7 3 searches per user up to 10 6 searches per user per month
1034952 the number of unique search users increased 370 percent indicating greater penetration into that carriers data plan base the subscriber base of users who have a data plan accounts for more searches more search terms and more searches per user
1034953 getting the most targeted results and the highest cpms for our publishing partners
1034954 if you want to convert traffic into subscribers for whatever your site offers then thats a very different business strategy from saying
1034955 when we talk to advertisers were hearing its two to three times more because of the targeting and the effectiveness
1034956 advertisers getting 10x in terms of click through rates it really does come down to being able to target at the keyword level
1034957 if someone is a big red sox fan then you dont want to show them a yankees ad
1034958 giving the developers in our network economy of scale quickly
1034959 this approach to targeting fits best within an application that is already location aware
1034960 will like to see jumptap involved in the future in other application platforms

1035105 the whole setting of the commercial is harmless parody intended to amuse and the reasonable viewer would see it as such the main actor is not identified in any way and it is therefore not reasonable to conclude that he represents idi amin

1035135 he has caused a lot of grief and someone who has a responsible nature doesnt go out and buy a car like that

1035140 because kylie and alex are such good friends she spoke to him loads about the tour during the planning stages so it was only right she invited him over to see the finished product

1035152 figures such as these indicate the extent to which consumers are prepared to alter their behaviour in one way this can be seen as proof of consumer resilience in times of economic hardship it seems britons are making necessary changes to their lifestyles rather than sliding further into debt for example its encouraging to note that the total number of insolvencies in england and wales in the first quarter of 2008 was actually down more than 13 per cent on the same period a year before
1035153 worst way of reacting to financial problems is to do nothing

1035163 bonuses do not lead to improved performance our high performance has come from work we would have done anyway
1035164 we are fighting for the best pay deal possible and not to have officers reliant on ad hoc bonuses
1035165 this seems to be an extraordinary amount of money to give in bonuses at a time when there is apparently not enough money to honour even the basic police pay settlement
1035166 with some forces clearly struggling to protect the public adequately there are serious questions to be asked about why so many bonuses are being paid out across the board
1035167 we are committed to reviewing the bonus scheme in order to understand if and how it improves performance

1035199 the bottom line is that those people are replaceable everybody is until you run out of suitable replacements that is and the human resources dept of al queerda has been busy trying to fill suddenly opened leadership positions lately sure you can always replace them if your only requirement for the post is a pulse but outside of the new york times that rarely suffices when were talking management positions the organization has developed in such a way that it can survive and fill in any gap even if osama bin laden was to die

1035210 women should be hot and look hot but not be too sexual
1035211 if a woman spends all her time worrying about whether she is normal or has a g spot or not she will focus on just one area and ignore everything else its telling people that there is a single best way to have sex which isnt the right thing to do
1035212 nowadays some business women are eschewing the book club and wine bar for another girls only gathering the sex toy party modeled after the traditional tupperware party these increasingly popular events give career women the chance to relax and buy items like lubricants and performance enhancers in the privacy of someones home

1035219 ha pasado sin ning n tipo de aviso estaba administrando el ritmo porque ten a una buena ventaja sobre el segundo despu s de que hamilton se quedara atr s por sus problemas y no estaba corriendo ning n riesgo estoy muy decepcionado porque hoy ten a un gran coche y todo hab a ido perfectamente hasta pocos kil metros antes del final por desgracia la competici n puede ser cruel ahora no debemos rendirnos sino reaccionar r pidamente quedan siete carreras y 70 puntos en juego lo que significa que podemos recuperar terreno nuestros rivales son fuertes pero hemos demostrado que estamos a su nivel
1035220 lo siento por felipe y por el equipo porque es horrible perder una carrera de esa forma para m ha sido duro porque cuando pasas mucho tiempo detr s de un coche m s lento se hace frustrante y aburrido cuando al final pude presionar el coche iba muy bien pero era demasiado tarde cuando estaba detr s de glock hacia el final tuve que reducir porque ten a un problema mec nico y el equipo me dijo que me asegurara de llevar el coche a la meta es cierto que soy el que ha ganado m s puntos de los tres primeros en la clasificaci n lo que demuestra que el campeonato es realmente impredecible con altibajos para todos ha sido un fin de semana decepcionante pero he conseguido un resultado decente ahora debemos intentar solucionar los problemas que tenemos en calificaci n para salir delante y aprovechar el potencial del coche
1035221 hoy hemos demostrado la val a de nuestro equipo y nuestros pilotos pero nos ha faltado fiabilidad que es crucial felipe puede que haya hecho su mejor carrera y estamos muy decepcionados por lo que le ha pasado a solo unos pocos kil metros de la meta ha hecho una salida incre ble atacando en el momento adecuado y despu s ha administrado su ventaja en los ltimos compases de la carrera kimi se ha visto afectado por su mal resultado de ayer en calificaci n cuando sales atr s es dif cil remontar ha estado bloqueado detr s de alonso durante gran parte de la carrera pero cuando ha podido ha demostrado el potencial del f2008 debemos reaccionar a este momento negativo de la forma habitual con decisi n y desempe ando cada uno su papel tenemos tres semanas de mucho trabajo por delante para prepararnos para el gp de europa

1035349 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1035350 its true that obama doesnt take money directly from oil companies but then no presidential house or senate candidate does they cant corporations have been prohibited from contributing directly to federal candidates since the tillman act became law in 1907
1035351 does accept donations from oil company employees and he has two oilmen working as bundlers for the campaign collecting donations
1035352 we faulted him earlier for a tv ad in which he claimed i dont take money from oil companies in fact he does accept donations from oil company employees and he has two oilmen working as bundlers for the campaign collecting donations
1035353 the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations
1035354 obama is cherry picking here the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations yes exxon mobil but also to wal mart general motors and home depot to name a few of the other fortune 50 biggies even everybodys favorite starbucks would get the same tax break obamas statement is technically true but singling out oil companies suggests mccain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks he hasnt we rate obamas statement and the claim in the ad barely true
1035355 a lower corporate tax rate is essential to keeping good jobs in the united states america was once a low tax business environment but as our trade partners lowered their rates america failed to keep pace we now have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world making america a less attractive place for companies to do business american workers deserve the chance to make fine products here and sell them around the globe
1035356 proposed a cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies
1035357 mccains economic plan includes a proposed cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies not just oil companies
1035358 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
1035359 when asked about the claims that john mccain was in the pocket of big oil romney scoffed at obamas demonization of both the industry and of mccain and pointed out that obama takes money from the exact same source he decries in the ad
1035360 only one candidate in this runoff race is worthy to be district 1 commissioner and thats bruce levell
1035361 in the time ive known him bruce has exhibited integrity and honesty these qualities are essential for a commissioner
1035362 district 1 voters deserve better than a candidate who stoops to distortions fact twisting and misinformation as a campaign strategy that means levell is the only choice in district 1
1035363 moreover this is a crucial election given the challenges looming for gwinnett we simply must have a quality commissioner for district 1 i strongly encourage all district 1 residents who voted in the republican primary to take the time to cast a vote for levell for the good of gwinnett
1035364 we simply cant let the criminals take over this county
1035365 were going to have to get aggressive to fight those who would bring us down this plan will increase our law enforcement presence in neighborhoods and on our roads and it will keep our officers from spending valuable time with disorderly bar patrons
1035366 these bars and nightclubs that close at 5 a m undermine all the positive things our officers do during the day and there is no reason for them to stay open that late
1035367 the residents of district 1 have my word that i will make public safety my top priority on day one unless our citizens feel safe everything else we do is in vain
1035368 levell said the system could have nothing to do with the embattled metropolitan atlanta rapid transit authority instead it could be operated by gwinnett county transit the georgia regional transportation authority the georgia department of transportation or some entirely new agency
1035369 i have never said that marta should be the rail operator for gwinnett i have only said that gwinnett needs rail transit

1035414 of course i do man im not here to cause any trouble
1035415 its about tackling housing rehabilitation one neighborhood at a time
1035416 i grew up in these neighborhoods and the housing revitalization that we see happening in braddock and much of the mon valley is the truest form of change i have seen in many years
1035417 there has been little or no investment of this kind in the mon valley for years and we now see that people dont want to leave these communities if they have good and affordable housing
1035418 we are beginning to see what we have been talking about for years
1035419 the success of what we do depends on the strength of the community groups we work with and their commitment to identifying neighborhoods where we could make an impact
1035420 what we have found is that there are many nice houses in all of these neighborhoods but people often cant see that because of all the blight around them
1035421 we try to tackle such neighborhoods with expansive projects like a 25 house construction that can actually change the look of a neighborhood
1035422 we dont want the blight to spread many times we see neighborhoods which have pretty nice houses but then a few abandoned properties in the same area have the capacity to create other abandoned properties and absentee landlords
1035423 what we see mvi doing in the mon valley is a model of what we want to see happening in other parts of the state
1035424 it is a model of housing redevelopment that i hope places like philadelphia lancaster reading harrisburg and york will adopt
1035425 complying with the orders of the cult of the nothing
1035426 how closely we can extrapolate towards the singularity is debated certainly not earlier than the planck epoch
1035427 is not an abstract philosophical word with which we can choose to play or not the possibility is the root of the reality it is the source of the reality is what makes reality real
1035428 let me tell you you my dear got the better end of the deal
1035429 the portuguese attorney general in his recent statement made it very clear indeed that theres absolutely no evidence of any wrongdoing by kate and gerry in any way shape or form and journalists should bear that in mind when they examine the police files
1035430 a lot of this is historical detail drafted by officers who failed to find madeleine and who quite wrongfully were going down inaccurate lines of supposition and assumption
1035431 nuestros r os entre ellos el r o guasare est n contaminados y se est n secando as lo ha demostrado no s lo el ministerio del ambiente sino varios estudios de la universidad del zulia los embalses manuelote y tul que surten por completo a maracaibo la costa oriental del lago y el complejo petroqu mico el tablazo se encuentran ubicados en medio de la zona de influencia de las minas de carb n lo cual pone en peligro el suministro de agua a todo el estado zulia
1035432 basados en el art culo 128 de la constituci n sobre el modelo sustentable de pa s vale la pena preguntarse sobre qu base se sustenta la expansi n de la explotaci n carbon fera en el zulia
1035433 de las 8 millones de toneladas de carb n que se extraen en el pa s apenas unas 100 mil toneladas son de uso local
1035434 son s lo 250 empleados directos trabajando d a y noche en unas instalaciones de aproximadamente 15 mil metros de construcci n
1035435 nos dirigimos a ustedes como jefes de estado responsables de la paz y del bienestar colectivo de nuestros pueblos con el nico prop sito de hacerles un urgente llamado de atenci n y de responsabilidad por las acciones que adelantan sus gobiernos para la ejecuci n del proyecto gas fero denominado g ante la peligrosa situaci n generada en torno a la amazon a por las aceleradas decisiones tomadas para la construcci n de este mega gasoducto que partir a desde la desembocadura del r o orinoco venezuela atravesando el coraz n del amazonas en brasil hasta llegar a buenos aires argentina nosotros los abajo firmantes ciudadanos as organizaci n y movimientos sociales de suram rica y el mundo preocupados por la defensa del planeta y comprometidos con sus habitantes y con el destino de las generaciones presentes y futuras les manifestamos nuestra categ rica oposici n a este proyecto de interconexi n energ tica que en su recorrido de 8 000 km pasar a e intervendr a reas de alta vulnerabilidad ecol gica social cultural y de extrema importancia para la vida
1035436 bajo nuestra ptica ser a el paso definitivo para la destrucci n de la amazon a la guayana venezolana y diversos ecosistemas de la costa caribe a y atl ntica poniendo en riesgo inminente a la regi n con devastadoras consecuencias para el planeta
1035437 el s lo planteamiento de este fara nico proyecto inconsulto por dem s viola convenios y acuerdos sobre derechos econ micos sociales y culturales desc y otros tratados internacionales suscritos por nuestros pa ses y ha sido dado a conocer por medios oficiales sin contar con los estudios previos necesarios en cuanto a factibilidad e impacto ambiental sociocultural y econ mico
1035438 la integraci n de nuestros pueblos es pertinente y necesaria pero basada en un enriquecedor intercambio social y cultural en el di logo de saberes en el intercambio de experiencias agro ecol gicas sin transg nicos ni monocultivos en la satisfacci n del d ficit energ tico basada en el uso consciente de la energ a y en la producci n de energ as alternativas mediante procesos ecol gicos
1035439 no compartimos la integraci n que visualiza el desarrollo del proyecto gasoducto del sur sin considerar el grave impacto que se le estar a causando a la amazonia que es garant a de vida reservorio de agua dulce de biodiversidad y h bitat natural de muchos pueblos ind genas esta mal llamada integraci n no traer a ni unidad ni bienestar a los pueblos del sur ya que est fundamentada en la sobre explotaci n de los recursos naturales y en la destrucci n del patrimonio biodiverso que existe en esta excepcional regi n sin lugar a dudas ese proyecto acrecentar la deuda ecol gica y social y por ende la pobreza
1035440 la integraci n de nuestros pueblos requiere un cambio de paradigma que se aparte del modelo de desarrollo dependiente de los hidrocarburos impuesto a nuestra civilizaci n una visi n de protecci n ambiental integral en aras de detener el aumento de la deuda ecol gica y social la defensa de nuestros derechos como acreedores y no deudores de una deuda externa una relaci n directa estado ciudadano para el dise o de pol ticas p blicas y el fortalecimiento de valores de libertad igualdad equidad justicia paz de no discriminaci n respeto a la vida y a los derechos humanos
1035441 en consecuencia por lo antes expuesto solicitamos de ustedes descartar definitivamente la construcci n del gasoducto del sur como medio para cubrir las necesidades energ ticas de suram rica y buscar una opci n c nsona con la realidad ecol gica social y econ mica de la regi n
1035442 el plan de atravesar el amazonas deber a encender todas las alarmas de la gente preocupada por el medio ambiente
1035443 la construcci n de una gigantesca y larga tuber a como la planteada y su complementaria hilera de plantas de compresi n que atravesar a la integridad de todos los ecosistemas naturales y pr stinos al requerir de gran deforestaci n y remoci n de tierra para hacer posible su paso as como caminos nuevos en sitios antes v rgenes para asegurar el permanente mantenimiento y vigilancia que la obra
1035444 las tuber as de hidrocarburos son inexorablemente proclives al desgaste y la corrosi n esta ltima particularmente relevante en el caso de los ambientes h medos tropicales como el guayan s amaz nico lo que hace que estas tuber as sean m s propensas a las filtraciones contaminantes o rupturas con derrames

1035462 everybody that comes into israel we have to question them about the reason they are coming especially if they are in a terror organisation
1035463 these people are not going to assist us because the moment they come back to gaza they are already suspected of being collaborators
1035464 we do not waste time and effort on people who cannot help us
1035465 we dont question that israel has to protect itself and that maybe it needs to find out something about a person who wants to enter our problem is that they are questioning patients about other people
1035466 you are not allowed to use civilians as part of the conflict
1035467 i believe we need to ask tough questions about the instant hit hedonism celebrated by the modern mens magazines targeted at younger males
1035468 titles such as nuts and zoo paint a picture of women as permanently lasciviously uncomplicatedly available
1035469 the contrast with the work done by womens magazines and their publishers to address their readers in a mature and responsible fashion is striking
1035470 all staff shared an absolute passion for customer service and there were some very impressive examples of staff addressing customer needs and going the extra mile
1035471 this was a superb assessment and a credit to all our infrastructure staff they are great ambassadors for our organisation and deserve a lot of praise for the way they are supporting our customers day in day out
1035472 as with all unsolved murders this case remains open and subject to review
1035473 this remains a met police investigation officers from the homicide command from the specialist crime directorate led by commander simon foy will today begin the process of further assessment and scrutiny of the available evidence to establish whether there are further potential investigative leads in this case
1035474 to be quite honest and practical i dont think theyll ever find who done it
1035475 i will maintain that i will look anyone in the eye and state i have not killed jill dando

1035478 during inflation customers always prefer to shop in a value retail outlet
1035479 inflation and discount retailing are directly proportional customers normally tend to flock to value retail stores where they are assured of good quality at reasonable prices
1035480 in mumbai alone our footfalls are up by 17 in the last three weeks in the first quarter we had sales of rs 15 crore in the next quarter we expect this to climb upto rs 25 crore
1035481 as children especially toddlers normally outgrow their clothes pretty fast parents are flocking to discount stores such as ours more than ever before
1035482 from a largely middle class audience i now see people getting out of cars like honda accord and mercedes benz outside our stores
1035483 but in times of inflation and continued price rise the consumer is looking to cut spends across categories on a daily basis
1035484 hurting the feelings of a community to the extent possible
1035485 today the most insane wasteful spending program in america comes to an end
1035486 we will comply with any changes in federal law and we will be able to implement these changes easily
1035487 when anything brings discredit on the student aid programs that disgrace needs to be avoided

1035515 do you remember when you and scott came to help me pack and move
1035516 ya i do that was one crazy day but that night was even crazier

1035533 a customer now looks for more than just shopping we realise that convergence of retail and entertainment is the way to enhance a shoppers experience we are constantly trying to get things that are shopping plus so we have crossword our bookstore cafe brio amp desicafe and other such specialty stores within shoppers stop stores to enrich consumer experience
1035534 the initiative is in the planning stage there is a definite market
1035535 we do a business of rs 100 crore every month this is 5 of our revenues today consumers expect to feel relaxed and entertained this is important for a chain like ours that wants to be differentiated this concept however may not have much potential with discount chains
1035536 we are staying focused on what we sell groceries mobile phones and medicines there will be a foray into consumer durables and it products soon
1035537 a great reinforcement to the writing process as well as an excellent introduction to the students on how to integrate the computer with their daily writing and illustrating

1035539 we really do live in a 24 7 society and its not uncommon to be online and checking email at all hours of the day
1035540 sometimes we need to take a step back and refresh with an empty inbox or even a new inbox altogether to clear our mind and focus on those emails and relationships that are most important to us
1035541 if you converse regularly bantering back and forth throughout the course of your workday its okay to leave out a salutation
1035542 otherwise people can feel as though you didnt care enough to write out their name to really get someones attention the best thing you can do is call them by name
1035543 at the end of the day its all about your image
1035544 typos and poor grammar are the equivalent of walking into a room looking unshowered and disheveled good writing in an email shows you have both professionalism and class
1035545 we shouldnt be doing this i dont want you to get the wrong idea
1035546 i promise i wont do anything just let me lay here on top of you and feel you with my hands

1035554 investing is the one sphere of life and activity where victory security and success is always to the minority and never to the majority
1035555 i do think some things are obvious it is obvious the credit crisis will end and it is obvious the housing crisis will end and that credit markets will function satisfactorily and house prices will stop going down and then start moving higher it is obvious that the american consumer will spend sufficiently to keep the economy moving forward long term it is obvious that the u s economy already the most productive in the world will get even more productive and will adapt and grow it is obvious stock prices will be higher in the future than they are now

1035610 we hope this trial will be viewed as timely and beneficial research in an area where there is clearly a demonstrated need for safe and effective products to treat cold and flu in children who suffer from these ailments much more than adults
1035611 these results are promising and support the development of a childrens formulation
1035612 current estimates suggest that 41 to 45 of children in canada and the united states use nhps
1035613 our data reveal a disturbingly high rate of exposure among 10 14 year olds nationally to extremely violent movies
1035614 in britain no adolescent would be admitted to these movies unless they were 18 the r rating in this country is clearly not preventing our young people from seeing them
1035615 we know so much about the harmful effects of exposure to violent media content but how much exposure children actually get has been largely ignored now were learning more about the large numbers of kids seeing this material and who they are
1035616 no expert in child development would advocate for subjecting children as young as 10 to this level of violence yet the study shows that such exposure is commonplace in this country
1035617 we should re think the current movie rating system which has been in place for 40 years and was designed when kids could only see movies in theaters
1035618 there is no doubt that the technique has potential in the industry for recycling nonmetallic materials of pcbs
1035619 our study found that several cm types are used by nearly half of cancer survivors
1035620 surprisingly other methods such as acupuncture and hypnosis were used by fewer than 2 of cancer survivors even though recent studies found them to be useful in relieving some cancer related symptoms such as pain we also found that the use of various cm types is significantly influenced by gender race age education cancer type and how far the cancer had spread

1035622 every year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for diving related injury
1035623 more than 80 of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to one meter so that is not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at the pool
1035624 there is a need for increased prevention efforts to lower the risks of diving related injuries among children and adolescents
1035625 the recent growth of the sport of diving coupled with the increasing complexity and difficulty of dives has resulted in a greater potential for both competitive and recreational diving related injuries
1035626 based on our findings the largest age group of injured divers was 10 to 14 year olds
1035627 although this group made up the largest number of injured divers 10 to 19 years olds were more at risk for an injury to the extremities boys were two times more likely to experience a head or neck injury or a fracture
1035628 parents pediatricians coaches lifeguards and trainers need to be aware of the types of injuries seen during recreational and competitive diving as well as the risk factors

1035634 prima di arrivare alle misure che comportano una drastica riduzione della dotazione organica e la conseguente messa in mobilit di personale sarebbe opportuno rivedere lorganizzazione degli uffici e dei servizi dellorario di lavoro

1035636 we completely reject kirkuk becoming a part of kurdistan and consider this the beginning of a crisis and strife in the city it could lead to civil war in kirkuk
1035637 threat to do so if no agreement is reached regarding the provincial election law
1035638 the committee discussing kirkuk could not find a solution and has asked for more time
1035639 the problem of kirkuk is a complicated one and failure to reach a solution will lead to more bloodshed
1035640 the parties responsible for the attacks in kirkuk might be the same parties that attacked mahmoud al mashhadani and caused him to faint we are concerned that there might be other surprises that could lead the country to a state of chaos
1035641 as for fainting some political parties might be responsible for it they might have administered poison to him or done something else to cause him to faint
1035642 the language of deadline setting is not understandable to us we gave them our response within a month as we said we would now they have to reply to us
1035643 perhaps based on incorrect analysis some of the geneva participants got the wrong expectation but our job was to give our views to the 5 1 framework then we gave our own framework
1035644 both sides said that in future meetings they should work on the commonalities of both frameworks in a constructive way to reach an agreement that satisfies both sides otherwise irans constructive activities will take their natural course
1035645 what deadline are you people even talking about its your turn to respond to us
1035646 we know that symptoms of depression may be a factor that is linked to both drug and alcohol use and sexual risk taking behaviors
1035647 however juvenile offenders arent routinely screened for emotional difficulties such as depression or anxiety rather everyone tends to focus more on their conduct or behavioral problems
1035648 models of juvenile correction that address mental health and physical health are crucial because arrestees contact with the legal system may represent one of few opportunities to address health issues
1035649 la loba wolf woman the old one the one who knows is within us she thrives in the deepest soul psyche of women the ancient and vital wild woman she describes her home as that place in time where the spirit of women and the spirit of wolf meet the place where her mind and her instincts mingle where a womans deep life funds her mundane life it is the point where the i and the thou kiss the place where women run with the wolves the creation mother is always the death mother and vice versa because of this dual nature or double tasking the great work before us is to learn to understand what around and about us and what within us must live and what must die our work is to apprehend the timing of both to allow what must die to die and what must live to live you can dent the soul and bend it you can hurt it and scar it you can leave the marks of illness upon it and the scorch marks of fear but it does not die for it is protected by la loba in the underworld she is both the finder and the incubator of the bones people do meditation to find psychic alignment thats why people do psychotherapy and analysis thats why people analyze their dreams and make art that is why many read tarot cards cast i ching dance drum make theater pry out the poem and fire up the prayer thats why we do all the things we do it is the work of gathering all the bones together then we must sit at the fire and think about which song we will use to sing over the bones which creation hymn which re creation hymn and the truths we tell will make the song there are some good questions to ask till one decides on the song ones true song what has happened to my soul voice what are the buried bones of my life in what condition is my relationship to the instinctual self when was the last time i ran free how do i make life come alive again where has la loba gone to go back and stand under that one red flower and walk straight ahead for that last hard mile go up and knock on the old weathered door climb up to the cave crawl through the window of a dream sift the desert and see what you can find it is the only work we have to do you wish psychoanalytic advice go gather bones

1035802 candidates are required to answer rigorous questionnaires on issues and to defend their positions in interviews
1035803 council for a livable world believes that iran does not currently pose an imminent threat to the united states and is unlikely to do so for years and perhaps more than a decade
1035804 the short answer to the question is no iran is not a threat however iran is still a concern it is true they still do have the capability to enrich uranium its true they still need more transparency in their nuclear process its true they fund hamas in hezbollah its true they are not partners for peace in the arab israeli situation

1036003 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming but who does actually strive to do the deeds who knows great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat

1036006 what we have is based upon moment to moment choices of what we do in each of those moments we choose we either take a risk and move toward what we want or we play it safe and choose comfort most of the people most of the time choose comfort in the end people either have excuses or experiences reasons or results buts or brilliance they either have what they wanted or they have a detailed list of all the rational reasons why not

1036008 you will be what you will to be let failure find its false content in that poor word environment but spirit scorns it and is free it masters time it conquers space it cows that boastful trickster chance and bids the tyrant circumstance uncrown and fill a servants place the human will that force unseen the offspring of a deathless soul can hew the way to any goal though walls of granite intervene be not impatient in delay but wait as one who understands when spirit rises and commands the gods are ready to obey the river seeking for the sea confronts the dam and precipice yet knows it cannot fail or miss you will be what you will to be

1036015 when you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality other people get killed not you then when you are badly wounded the first time you lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you after being severely wounded two weeks before my 19th birthday i had a bad time until i figured out that nothing could happen to me that had not happened to all men before me whatever i had to do men had always done if they had done it then i could do it too and the best thing was not to worry about it

1036017 analyze the ctb election from a more conceptual perspective asking why the regulations allow a choice of business tax regimes in the particular circumstances in which the choice is afforded
1036018 thus to justify the ctb election as a simple and efficient approach to line drawing between business tax regimes applicable to virtually indistinguishable forms of business the existence of each separate business tax regime must be defended
1036019 the income tax is not a tax on benefits conferred any additional tax on such benefit conferred would not in any event measure properly the value of the benefit obtained limited liability is an efficient characteristic for firms and a classification rule based on limited liability would also raise difficult implementation questions moreover query why the federal government should be entitled to extract a tax on the benefit of limited liability that is actually conferred by the state governments
1036020 some unincorporated entities like the blackstone group l p and fortress investment group llc are publicly traded but are allowed to elect their tax classification

1036025 when we first prescribed highly active antiretroviral therapy for hiv in 1995 we were concerned about how these drugs changed lipid levels in patients and whether they would increase atherosclerosis and ultimately lead to serious heart disease
1036026 while some studies have found an association between these antiretroviral treatments and increased risk of cardiovascular disease we believe our findings should reassure clinicians that using antiretroviral therapy over time does not appear to put patients at greater risk for coronary atherosclerosis and may in fact be more beneficial than we had initially thought
1036027 this was not surprising since these are the major risk factors for atherosclerosis in the general population
1036028 the purpose of our study however was to investigate whether long term haart usage was a major risk factor
1036029 these results could be due in part to lower lipid values of hiv infected men prior to beginning antiretroviral therapy and high use of lipid lowering drugs the key is that controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis should be a priority
1036030 what remains to be determined is whether use of the newest antiretroviral therapies confers an even better outcome and whether lipid lowering therapies will further improve cardiovascular risk in the hiv infected population our future research will address these questions
1036031 genetically we have been very successful in breeding animals that can grow very quickly but the down side is that comes at the price of eating quality
1036032 the work we are doing focuses on finding out more at a molecular level about how fast muscle can switch to slow muscle and could lead to a better understanding of how to genetically choose animals for breeding that will produce better quality meat
1036033 community recreation and parks is the health provider that you dont know about
1036034 traditionally these agencies are considered as organizers of games and sports in a towns parks or ball fields but our study shows that 9 out of 10 recreation and park professionals are actively involved in a health partnership sometimes several of them
1036035 twenty years ago health care providers didnt consider recreation and park professionals to be a partner in the campaigns to promote health but in the 1990s community based health partnerships were starting to consider the role of recreation and parks in promoting physical activity and quality of life since many related programs are offered by recreation and park managers
1036036 health campaigns naturally involve recreation and park departments because they provide low cost close to home opportunities for physical activity such as trails recreation centers outdoor courts and outdoor swimming facilities
1036037 parks trails and recreation centers can also serve as settings for physical rehabilitation
1036038 having facilities is critical but then programs also have to be established to bring in residents and encourage them to take part
1036039 partnerships that include after school programs diet and nutritional information and policy efforts to promote recreational settings should be encouraged
1036040 the study was designed to provide baseline information on the state of current health partnership practices within the profession their successes and their challenges
1036041 such information can be used to help a community effectively develop a program in health and physical activity promotion

1036126 the russian manner in acconrdance with the canons of the russian orthodox church that makes relics out of its saints apparently we the party of revolutionary marxism are advised to behave in the same way to preserve the body of lenin earlier there were the relics of sergius of radonez and serafim of sarov now they want to replace these with the relics of vladimir illich
1036127 the lenin cult was less an actual substitute for religion than a party effort to fuse religious and political ritual to mobilize the population
1036128 you have taxpayers subsidizing the risk takers mortgage lenders which i find unacceptable
1036129 the more i think back the more reasons i think of that i oppose this on
1036130 it actually undoes some of the risk lenders took when they loaned money to these people
1036131 the only way it will cost the taxpayers money will be if the renegotiated mortgages are defaulted on
1036132 as the homes are foreclosed on then no one pays property taxes
1036133 if you dont do this bill to keep homes out of foreclosure the property taxes for everyone else will rise to make up for it the loss of revenue
1036134 my point is theres no loss of taxes under this bill

1036142 the grand jury has no doubt that he never prepared these documents

1036152 tries to defend to defend polygamy values by saying that when a family is made up of several wives with their households it means that in times of need there will be someone to help
1036153 in monogamy when the wife dies the husband eventually brings a stranger to the children for a stepmother who may or may not discharge the needed care
1036154 traditionally in case of sickness other wives will fetch water from the river cut firewood and virtually take up all other jobs for the family when one becomes barren others bear children for the family when one is weak others strengthen the family

1036157 zook said friday july 25 at the big ten media event
1036158 two things we said when we got back from california one we said guys when you watch the tape youre going to be really disappointed we didnt play the way were capable of playing and the no 2 thing is we know what people are saying
1036159 thats why if we can take a freshman class and go all four years and win then you can say youve turned the corner
1036160 what you have to take into perspective as a reporter is find out when those games were scheduled
1036161 the reason i scheduled cal poly was because before we play michigan ohio state and penn state back to back this season i was set to play virginia tech and that didnt seem like a good idea for me when you have those games i got out of playing virginia tech
1036162 the reason i think weve been successful is because weve had good scheduling
1036163 as i travel minnesota i feel the states pain and the fact that we havent represented the big ten in a long time in pasadena thats a tremendous challenge for me our staff and our school without question we believe we can make an impact in the big ten
1036164 when i arrived in 1993 if we would have had six wins then we would have had a parade down central street we wouldve shut it down and had a purple party in chicago
1036165 but things have changed its taken 13 years and were not where we need to be
1036166 ladies guys like playing video games because we can eventually figure them out and win
1036167 people probably think im crazy when i say it but chris wells is the closest thing to jim brown that ive ever seen
1036168 that says a whole lot i know but i really believe it
1036169 i want the person whos deserving of winning the heisman trophy to win the heisman trophy
1036170 i certainly want beanie to have a great season because hes here at ohio state and i know him extremely well but i also want to make sure that he has the season thats deserving of winning it if hes going to win it and the same thing with tebow
1036171 mainly its his speed his strength and the way that he brushes people off of him
1036172 people can hit him and just fall off of him
1036173 its almost comical when you watch it because it seems like people try to get to him and he just brushes them off of him with that stiff arm thats one of the reasons i say he really reminds me of jim brown
1036174 the last thing we need is the same old folks doing the same old things over and over again

1036214 there are strategies for dealing with really high minerality in wine and the number one strategy would certainly be to make use of blending
1036215 varietal winemaking was invented by californians for californians in california where you have almost zero calcium in most of the soil you can go out and plant cabernet and it comes back this big juicy fruity jammy kind of wine here we go out and plant cabernet and it comes back this super hard tannic monster that is just untamable the response to that is to use grapes that arent as calcium sensitive and there are a lot of good choices for that
1036216 of all those grapes i think the most noteworthy thing is the discovery of the palomino grape especially in northern texas
1036217 it used to be the most widely grown grape in spain when we first started making wine in 1983 the palomino just jumped off the page i was stunned by the quality of the wine
1036218 the guy who lives there now really likes having his own little vineyard in the back of the house i sold a great house and bought a winery that shows you how smart i am
1036219 all three of those grapes are going to favor cherry raspberry and strawberry flavors and those are all going to be enhanced by calcium
1036220 they both have relatively low respiration rates about eight hours under 65 degrees every night which is really hard for most of texas
1036221 in 1999 after all those years of research i went to grape farmer neal newsom in plains and told him he was sitting on americas best spot for growing tempranillo grapes and asked him if hed grow them for me
1036222 he promptly told me no i asked him to think about it and he said no again because nobody was growing tempranillo in 1999 nobody even knew what it was it wasnt even on the horizon
1036223 newsoms place is at nearly 3 800 feet elevation normally by 11 every night its down to 60 or 61 degrees the top soil is sandy but there are calichi beds underneath so theres still plenty of calcium
1036224 finally after two or three years i caught him in a weak moment and he said i could put a block of tempranillo grapes on his land and hed tend them hell tell you today that tempranillo is far and away the best variety of grapes he grows thats how we started to build our business
1036225 i wasnt sure what i was going to do with it i had 20 extra barrels so i just put them in the cellars and didnt touch them for a year and a half i took it to some wine bars i do business with in houston and they wanted 100 cases as soon as they could get them tempranillos the only varietal wine we make the other two are blends
1036226 if your winery is a few hundred yards from your vineyard
1036227 youre not going to get any appreciable deterioration in the grapes from the time you move them from the field to the winery
1036228 so we set up our crusher in the field and we dump those bins into it right there and then we have some temporary tanks the must juice skins stems seeds goes in once the must is in there with the sulfur dioxide its a whole lot more stable its basically on cold soak from then on
1036229 i feel like its a matter of necessity but im the only guy in the state who does it so there are a lot of people who disagree with me
1036230 were selling to people who are paid to look at 50 000 to 60 000 wines in the wholesale books and pick out 300 if those guys are buying our wine thats your best form of acclamation

1036477 edouard could be nearing hurricane strength before reaching the coastline
1036478 convinced that the olympic games will improve human rights in china
1036479 theres still a strong perception in the west that the chinese are oppressed
1036480 the protests weve seen about chinas human rights record ahead of the olympics will only have increased that sense
1036481 theres not much evidence here of a desire to blame china for the big global problems were currently faced with like rising energy prices or food prices
1036482 and its surprising that despite all the concern about the growth in chinas carbon emissions its people in the other big emerging economies like brazil or india that are more likely to blame china for climate change
1036483 weve seen support for globalisation drop off in recent years around the world and this may be more evidence of people in the west worrying about jobs disappearing into lower wage economies in the developing world
1036484 maybe one of the most surprising things in the poll is that even though china as a country has been isolated from the outside world for such a long time majorities in britain the us and india still see the chinese as friendly and over half in the us and britain think that the chinese are like them

1036535 barack obamas latest negative attack ad shows his celebrity is matched only by his hypocrisy after all it was senator obama not john mccain who voted for the bush cheney energy bill that was a sweetheart deal for oil companies also not mentioned is the 400 000 from big oil contributors that barack obama has already pocketed in this election
1036536 its true that obama doesnt take money directly from oil companies but then no presidential house or senate candidate does they cant corporations have been prohibited from contributing directly to federal candidates since the tillman act became law in 1907
1036537 does accept donations from oil company employees and he has two oilmen working as bundlers for the campaign collecting donations
1036538 we faulted him earlier for a tv ad in which he claimed i dont take money from oil companies in fact he does accept donations from oil company employees and he has two oilmen working as bundlers for the campaign collecting donations
1036539 the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations
1036540 obama is cherry picking here the corporate tax rate reduction would apply to all corporations yes exxon mobil but also to wal mart general motors and home depot to name a few of the other fortune 50 biggies even everybodys favorite starbucks would get the same tax break obamas statement is technically true but singling out oil companies suggests mccain has targeted oil companies for tax breaks he hasnt we rate obamas statement and the claim in the ad barely true
1036541 a lower corporate tax rate is essential to keeping good jobs in the united states america was once a low tax business environment but as our trade partners lowered their rates america failed to keep pace we now have the second highest corporate tax rate in the world making america a less attractive place for companies to do business american workers deserve the chance to make fine products here and sell them around the globe
1036542 proposed a cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies
1036543 mccains economic plan includes a proposed cut in the corporate tax rate for all u s companies not just oil companies
1036544 sen obamas nod to lowering corporate taxes comes as republicans have been attacking him for proposals that would raise the cost of doing business such as his pledge to raise the tax rate on capital gains and his vow to increase the top income tax rates which are often used by small unincorporated enterprises he didnt say how deeply he would cut the rate but said it could be trimmed in return for reducing corporate tax breaks simplifying the tax system
1036545 this bill does little to address the immediate energy crisis we face in this country the handouts to big business and oil companies are irresponsible and will be disastrous for people of arizona i cannot in good conscience vote to pass legislation that does not adequately address issues related to energy efficiency security and energy independence
1036546 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
1036547 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
1036548 from 1980 to 1988 the wpt may have reduced domestic oil production anywhere from 1 2 to 8 0 320 to 1 269 million barrels dependence on imported oil grew from between 3 and 13
1036549 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
1036550 the wpt had the effect of reducing the domestic supply of crude oil below what the supply would have been without the tax this increased the demand for imported oil and made the united states more dependent upon foreign oil as compared with dependence without a wpt
1036551 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
1036552 skeptics who want to check the data need to search no further than the eight year 1980s run of the energy industry windfall profit tax during that time domestic oil output fell to its lowest level in two decades
1036553 the last time congress imposed a form of the windfall tax was the final gloomy days of jimmy carter and the result was a substantial reduction in domestic oil production about 5 thus raising the price of gas at the pump and a 10 increase in u s reliance on foreign oil a windfall profits tax is the ultimate act of economic masochism because it taxes only domestic production while imports and foreign oil subsidiaries bear almost none of the cost
1036554 the track record for punitive measures like the windfall profits tax shows that they usually harm consumers along with the targeted industry in the end the tax hurt consumers more through higher energy prices than it helped them through higher tax revenues which turned out to be far lower than originally predicted because the tax discouraged production
1036555 raising taxes on oil companies is no way to reduce gas prices
1036556 john breaux you are from the oil patch how do you feel about your candidate talking about a windfall profits tax
1036557 well a windfall profits tax is not going to produce a single barrel of oil when we had a windfall profits tax back in the 1980s we produced less energy than before we had the tax a windfall profits tax may make you feel good as a punitive measure against the energy companies but until we get the guys and women who produce the energy working with those that consume it we are never going to solve the problem a windfall profits tax will produce less energy and not more
1036558 democratic presidential candidate barack obamas proposal for a windfall profits tax on oil companies could cost 15 billion a year at last years profit levels a campaign adviser said
1036559 obama may levy 15 billion tax on oil company profit
1036560 the 80 billion in gross revenues generated by the wpt between 1980 and 1988 was significantly less than the 393 billion projected
1036561 the crude oil windfall profit tax of the 1980s implications for current energy policy
1036562 our dangerous dependence on foreign oil has been thirty years in the making and was caused by the failure of politicians in washington to think long term about the future of the country

1036640 i am religious and i am a priest but i am not doing this to convert people to christ to faith or the church but for them to try to understand life to be able to enjoy it nothing more
1036641 about 90 percent are very good they accept me the other 10 percent are more extreme
1036642 they say we dont want people from the church there are those who profess to be satanists but there are only two or three groups that explicitly claim to be so i do not really know whether they really are they claim to be
1036643 we do not understand what has happened its not as if we had done any publicity the cd wasnt even out yet ive sung three times at gods of metal already
1036644 ive been doing this for 10 years and its only really now that it has taken off
1036645 at first i was a bit skeptical about this project because i thought it was weird to have a mix of heavy metal and a capuchin friar
1036646 but after two minutes with him you forget he is a friar his age you forget everything and he becomes a member of the group he gave me more energy than bandmates who are my age or younger are able to when you play with him there are smiles and a lot of energy which is fundamental for heavy metal
1036647 i could sing this heavy metal but they would say its too loud

1036674 centrica confirms that it is in discussions with a third party with a view to centrica taking a minority ownership position in british energy subject to various conditions including this third party successfully acquiring british energy
1036675 in the event that the third party does not proceed with an offer for british energy or centricas discussions with the third party do not result in an agreement centrica might consider a number of other alternatives with respect to british energy
1036676 these alternatives may include a possible merger of centrica with british energy only if terms could be agreed and if all parties are fully supportive

1036678 the treadmill is going faster than the legs at least when it comes to consumers and their spending household consumption surged in june but much of that went to purchase higher priced food and energy
1036679 the primary function of a trial court or tribunal is to evaluate evidence placed before it before arriving at a conclusion
1036680 in the case at hand the trial court failed to assess the evidence or the witnesses and also did not review or evaluate them worse still the opinion of the judge advocate was not considered as required by the law and so warrant this courts intervention to evaluate or re evaluate the evidence adduced at the trial court
1036681 indeed appellants conviction and sentence in counts 3 4 and 7 cannot stand since those counts were a duplication of the other counts when the particulars of the offences are viewed
1036682 in totality it was clearly evident that the appellant was not treated fairly in all ramifications and the trial fell short of what is expected even at a lay mans tribunal the appeal succeeds as i set aside the conviction and sentences in all the seven counts charges of the court martial as confirmed appeal allowed
1036683 the niger delta as it is today could be aptly described as a simmering cauldron of an immense proportion reminiscence of iraq iran and indeed lebanon
1036684 having fed and sustained the nigerian nation for over 50 years without adequate recompense having suffered inveterate ecological despoliation with its attendant eclipse of the people sources of livelihood having borne the humiliation of poverty and neglect of infrastructure having endured indignities of their land and resources being sequestrated by the manipulation of the laws by the nigerian state and indeed having suffered the mortal pains of her people being herded and cut down like cattle as we could see in the murder of kenule saro wiwa coupled with the sacking of odi and other niger delta communities the people of the niger delta are saying enough is enough
1036685 thus the youths in a reactionary response to years of oppression have taken up arms against the nigerian state seizing both indigenous and expatriate oil workers and torpedoing oil platforms and facilities this has provoked dramatic volatility in the world oil market like never before whilst also signalling an economic downturn for the nigerian economy this is the story of the niger delta
1036686 where do you see my urhobo people in all these
1036687 the church has to be part of the struggle because without it the struggle will not mean anything
1036688 it is very important for the youths to stop this violence violence will destroy things you will not gain anything from violence but rather it spoils things one big problem in nigeria is that people fight before settlement why shouldnt we settle before going to fight
1036689 i am an isoko boy and i tell you god can do everything without human being you cannot be anybody it is only god that will do it for you i went to the creek ugborodo escravos area to see things for myself what i saw of the life of the people is very appalling they are suffering and government has to do something fast

1036692 uncalled for particularly as peace is being sought by well meaning rivers people
1036693 refocus their minds on our drive to create a unifying force to fight against the injustice oppression marginalization meted on our people by the nigerian state
1036694 i want to thank you for raising this matter when we met some weeks ago it was agreed that governors in conjunction with the leaders should produce a list but i have not heard from the delta state government on the matter since we came back
1036695 in fact i cannot say what is holding up the list we are crying that the federal government is delaying the development of the niger delta and now it has dropped the idea of summit asked us to bring out people to appraise the various reports recommendations and we are wasting time
1036696 it should not be delayed at all the list does not require any special thing to be done before the governors act they should act fast because the people are waiting

1036709 the current levels of wages employment and corporate profits were just not maintainable given the low levels of productivity
1036710 that fundamentally is the difference between the u s and canada we still have the income kicker from high commodity prices

1036713 the first half of 2008 saw the most difficult financial markets for several decades marked by significant declines in profitability throughout much of our industry with consequent recapitalisation and restructuring
1036714 the outlook for the near term remains highly challenging with significant uncertainty
1036715 globally consumer confidence is declining and despite the short term success of the recent fiscal stimulus the us economy continues to be weak driven by continuing housing market difficulties
1036716 the uk and other economies in europe which had enjoyed housing market booms have also weakened the decline in credit availability is accelerating this process
1036717 ultimately the real economy will recover from this crisis although it may get worse before it gets better

1036780 people tended to take new orleans for granted as a party town with a specific kind of music when they realized such a treasure had been severely damaged if not lost forever they were forced to reconsider what new orleans meant as a cultural resource for the country
1036781 new orleans was on everybodys mind and there was this real hunger for its music musicians found themselves busier than they had been in years
1036782 you can have my husband but please dont mess with my man
1036783 people always thought of new orleans as the big easy bourbon street mardi gras and jazzfest home of this old time good time music
1036784 in katrinas wake you couldnt watch the devastation deaths and flooding and associate new orleans with good times so people were looking to artists to tell them what does new orleans mean now and to keep the citys legacy alive
1036785 all sorts of strong emotions come through in the music
1036786 when you hear them sing of a return to new orleans its as if theyre singing of a return to the promised land
1036787 it sounded nothing like marvin gaye and nothing like the dirty dozen brass band had done before
1036788 they substituted gayes silky soulfulness for a brassy assertiveness that gave the material new urgency
1036789 its ironic new orleans seemed to have a stronger sense of musical community when its musicians were scattered all over the country because they had this tragedy in common
1036790 its kind of like they were johnny appleseeds sowing the seeds of this music across the country
1036791 marquee is 100 open and it will be open for business as usual tomorrow they are always closed on monday
1036792 i hear from quite a few faculty members and graduate students from around the country they are not really interested in fighting the battles that have been fought over the last 20 years
1036793 there are signs that the intense passions and polemics that roiled campuses during the past couple of decades have begun to fade
1036794 self described liberals are most common within the ranks of those professors aged 50 64 who were teenagers or young adults in the 1960s
1036795 youd think that the further we get away from the 60s where a lot of our political attitudes are nurtured there would be

1036807 they have the most members of any in the county and she does a fantastic job
1036808 the kids always look forward to the fair theyre excited the whole week and they have a lot of fun showing animals and the fellowship being with the entire community
1036809 once a month we practice riding skills and show aspects of it like ring etiquette and that sort of thing
1036810 everybody is welcome to come bid on animals i guess the highlight would be you get to see or talk to the child or family that has raised that animal unlike when you go into a local store to buy say a thanksgiving turkey you dont necessarily know where it came from
1036811 when you buy at auction you know where it came from and what its fed which is a huge benefit in purchasing an animal for meat

1036838 we judge with moderate confidence that the earliest possible date iran would be technically capable of producing enough heu for a weapon is late 2009 but that this is very unlikely
1036839 all agencies recognize the possibility that this capability may not be attained until after 2015
1036840 wir nehmen mit hoher gewi heit an da der iran die wissenschaftliche technische und industrielle kapazit t hat m glicherweise atomwaffen herzustellen wenn er sich dazu entscheidet
1036841 allein schon da die mullahs ihr atomprogramm berhaupt verheimlichten bis es 2002 von den oppositionellen volksmudjaheddin aufgedeckt wurde l t wenig zweifel an dessen milit rischer ausrichtung

1036928 furthermore plans unless specifically designated for tethering usage cannot be used for any applications that tether the device through use of including without limitation connection kits other phone pda to computer accessories bluetooth or any other wireless technology to personal computers including without limitation laptops or other equipment for any purpose
1036929 the app may not violate a terms of service agreement of a different iphone carrier but in the us it does violate at amp ts tos

1036934 it matters most that they patch the client libraries since there are so few os x recursive servers in use

1036991 la biblia se asocia a la religi n aunque sta no es una perspectiva completa por una parte es el libro m s traducido en el mundo a m s de 2 mil 300 idiomas hasta el momento por tanto es la obra m s le da y a la vez la m s perseguido incluso por la misma iglesia pues se trata de un libro que ense a a pensar educa en la igualdad la libertad lo que en su momento afect intereses econ micos pol ticos e institucionales incluso la gente que logr conseguir en ese entonces la biblia fue quemada en la hoguera su traducci n implic guerras en otras ocasiones
1036992 en la m sica pintura escultura y literatura por ejemplo muchas personas han sido motivadas por la biblia hay gran cantidad de obras relacionadas con sus pasajes pero tambi n curiosamente la ciencia naci por la influencia b blica en el sentido de que kepler cop rnico y newton ven en la naturaleza una creaci n sujeta a leyes divinas y el hecho de estar sometidos a irregularidades les permiti investigar y tratar de descubrir otras explicaciones por el contrario si todo hubiera empezado con un universo an rquico no habr a sido de esta forma el desarrollo de la ciencia incluso si se hubiera promovido una religi n contemplativa como el budismo no habr a surgido la ciencia si vemos el mbito del derecho la teor a de los valores las constituciones y la declaraci n de los derechos del hombre retomaron principios b blicos

1037050 the thing about cell phones is you cant eat them you cant get into them for shelter and they dont warm you up they dont replace a pair of boots and they dont replace common sense
1037051 if you took the cell phone away from him at the beginning of the trail how would it have changed his decision making
1037052 i think a cell phone is a good way to get help when you need it
1037053 search and rescue officials say that hikers too often use their cellular telephones as a substitute for common sense
1037054 we have strengthened security work in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared in security for the upcoming games
1037055 you can see there are windows that are broken in a nearby building and a pole has been ripped out of the ground
1037056 you can see some wires hanging from another pole nearby
1037057 we do not wish to see such events nor would we want a repeat
1037058 but we cannot prevent beijings systematic suppression of the uighur people nor are we able to control such acts as these the chinese authorities policies and behaviour force uighurs down the road towards millitary action and attack
1037059 como presidenta de chile les deseo lo mejor y quiero hacer entrega de esta bandera que encarna el apoyo y la confianza de todos nuestros compatriotas

1037065 we are particularly satisfied as the prosecution of this programme guarantees to our company the maintenance of the know how developed in a century of activity in such a highly technological sector
1037066 testifies the results that may be achieved through the collaboration of the defence authorities with the national industry when the nation requires highly effective operational means to act within the complex political international scenario besides it consolidates the role of fincantieri as a major player operating in all the most important european initiatives in the naval defence sector
1037067 we take the tank to go shopping and little trips
1037068 it is a bit hard to find a parking place but we get right of way at every junction
1037069 the proposed sale of these helicopters missiles and mortar systems will be used to develop new iraqi air force iaf squadrons and or wings and to enhance the ability of the iaf to sustain itself in its efforts to bring stability to iraq
1037070 instant overwhelming leaving no choice of means and no moment for deliberation
1037071 not a united force not a world oriented terrorist movement but a real afghan phenomenon
1037072 if boeing has to say something negative about jsf to sell their aircraft that tells me there is something wrong with their aircraft
1037073 we will collaborate and work with the jsf that is the future of carrier aviation
1037074 i think theyre going to operate them for the next 30 35 years
1037075 the jsf schedule slip is a matter of public record our customers are coming back to us based on where they think the jsf will be and when it will be delivered and asking more about what are the capabilities cost and delivery schedule for a super hornet
1037076 a lot of jsf partner countries are looking at each other
1037077 what we are seeing in canada is the focus is on getting the right airplane we see the potential opportunity of competing
1037078 as far as we know they have already taken a decision to be part of the jsf programme
1037079 right now theyre looking at jsf but they havent shut the door
1037080 our norwegian offer is fully compliant and we have guaranteed a price
1037081 the gripen ng will be as good as jsf in many areas and better in some
1037082 we are pleased with the flights we have done so far
1037083 we are not going to leave our existing operators behind we will take them with us beyond 2040
1037084 for many years weve been competing with the f 16 now were starting to replace it
1037085 the customer has never taken a decision to cut the numbers
1037086 that complete set of documents is on the table with the customer and we are waiting for feedback on the route to the contract
1037087 the f 22 will not be released internationally in the near term
1037088 but in the close air support role would it add value to the guys on the ground at the moment the aircraft we have over in afghanistan and iraq are perfectly capable
1037089 while we wish that every post on this blog could be about cool features or other blogger news sometimes we have to step in and admit a mistake
1037090 we hope to have this resolved shortly and appreciate your patience as we work through the kinks
1037091 we have now restored all accounts that were mistakenly marked as spam weve tracked down the problem to a bug in our data processing code that locked blogs even when our algorithms concluded they were not spam we are adding additional monitoring and process checks to ensure that bugs of this magnitude are caught before they can affect your data
1037092 when i come upon a bad assonance or a repetition in my sentences im sure im floundering in the false by searching i find the proper expression which was always the only one and which is also harmonious the word is never lacking when one possesses the idea is there not in this precise fitting of parts something eternal like a principal if not why should there be a relation between the right word and the musical word or why should the greatest compression of thought always result in a line of poetry
1037093 constraint is as ever the mother of invention and maybe i havent yet figured out a suitable set of constraints to impose on myself when blogging
1037094 agreed in the absence of a clear positive response from iran we have no choice but to pursue other measures against iran
1037095 for people to paradoxically deal with each other as equals
1037096 youre making sure youre not exposing yourself to danger because throughout our history there has been a lot of danger there
1037097 and its not easy to change the hearts and identity of the people because of this
1037098 the equivalent of an engraved arch that says welcome to aratta
1037099 all the provinces are interested in excavating and every little town wants to be known around the world like jiroft theyre proud and there are rivalries
1037100 where could they go the desert there was no place to run and hide
1037101 and the countrys nuclear ambitions are directly related to this desire
1037102 at one time the area of the country was triple what it is now and it was a stable superpower for more than a thousand years
1037103 the borders have moved in over the centuries but this superpower nostalgia so in contradiction to reality
1037104 to know iran and what iran really is just read that transcription from cyrus
1037105 such greatness as the cylinder has been shown many times in iran
1037106 when i go abroad people get surprised when they realize that 65 percent of the college students here are girls
1037107 eventually we turned to the shiite sect which was different from the arabs who are sunni
1037108 everything went down after they came and we have never been the same
1037109 before they came we were a great and civilized power
1037110 they burned our books and raped our women and we couldnt speak farsi in public for 300 years or they took out our tongues
1037111 which is one of the oldest living languages in the world
1037112 oh god hillary clinton wants to raise me like a baby
1037113 oh that sounds cool and beautiful and somehow aesthetically pleasing
1037114 i doubt that the wires could be doped strongly enough for this surface to work
1037115 wires grown in the 011 direction will probably be the best compromise
1037116 goddank eindelijk een ander mens in deze barre eenzaamheid ik zal daar halt houden en om wat water vragen misschien kunnen we even gaan zitten voor een praatje voordat ik weer verder trek
1037117 waarschijnlijk heeft hij het erg druk en helemaal geen tijd en als ik hem lastig val zal hij zich ergeren misschien denkt hij wel dat ik onbeleefd ben
1037118 eindelijk een ander mens in deze barre omstandigheid ik hoop dat hij hierheen komt we zouden samen wat kunnen drinken en misschien even gaan zitten om een praatje te maken voordat hij weer verder trekt
1037119 hij heeft vast haast als ik hem aanspreek breng ik hem misschien in verlegenheid wellicht denkt hij wel dat ik mij aan hem opdring maar misschien heeft hij dorst en komt hij uit zichzelf wel hierheen ik kan maar het beste de tuin in gaan en doen alsof ik het druk heb hij zal me vast zien en als hij iets nodig heeft zal hij me er wel om vragen
1037120 deze keer zal ik de boer aanspreken ook al vindt hij me een lastpost ik heb vreselijke dorst en heb beslist iets te drinken nodig
1037121 hemel dat is nu precies wat ik niet kan gebruiken als ik veel te doen heb ik kan nu niet voor iemand anders gaan zorgen
1037122 ik heb grote dorst zou u me alstublieft iets te drinken kunnen geven
1037123 ik kan hem niet wegsturen dat zou niet goed zijn
1037124 ik zag daarnet uw tuin het is wel duidelijk dat er hier iemand aan het werk is die begrijpt wat tuinieren is en veel van planten houdt
1037125 maar de zon is al aan het zakken blijf vannacht toch hier we zullen morgenochtend vroeg ontbijten en dan kunt u weer verder
1037126 ik ben zo gewend geraakt aan zijn aanwezigheid dat ik hem zou missen als hij er niet meer was hij is mijn meest trouwe en dierbare vriend wanneer ik niet meer weet wat juist is of wat ik moet doen dan stop ik even en wacht op een antwoord ik heb mijzelf aan hem overgegeven ik weet dat hij daar is en ik hier ben zonder vast te houden aan mijn eigen verlangens wacht ik tot zijn boodschap tot mij doordringt wanneer ik goed bij mezelf ben en de moed heb komt er een woord van hem naar mij toe en als door een bliksemflits wordt de duisternis verlicht en word ik helder
1037127 ik zeg u thans dit monster van een olifant lijkt sprekend op een lans
1037128 doe niet zo sloom er is geen twijfel mogelijk dit beest is als een boom

1037947 hago cine y no cualquier otro oficio por 2 razones b sicas
1037948 a n no me considero una directora a n me estoy entrenando esperemos al primer largo propio
1037949 tiempo atr s hab a trabajado con marco mundara n en un proyecto cuando comenz a trabajar en el conac me invito a participar en unos documentales que estaban haciendo para la poca pero yo estaba metida de cabeza en otro proyecto y nunca pudimos hacer nada
1037950 marcos mundara n y lorena almarza tras haber visto un demo que les hab a dejado hac a alg n tiempo me invitaron a participar del proyecto una vez que supe las caracter sticas del proyecto inmediatamente me un al mismo vale decir que ya hab a trabajado con el equipo de la villa del cine desde su etapa en el piso 11 del centro sim n bol var y desde un comienzo el proyecto me encant v all a mucha gente joven haciendo documentales m s algunos cortos y ello me atrajo enormemente entonces hab a una relaci n previa muy buena con este equipo de gente
1037951 el proceso de postproducc n fue similar de mucha colaboraci n entre las tres pues desde un principio hab amos escuchado lo que cada una buscaba por supuesto que el entendimiento entre la gente no es f cil y entre mujeres en fin fue un proceso doloroso peleas l grimas melodrama y muy eventuales satisfacciones y ah est la hicimos junto a un equipo de gente muy bueno dispuestos y embarcados en esa aventura de hacer cine y que a todos causa tanta ilusi n
1037952 esta pel cula habla de 3 mujeres que est n en una coyuntura de vida en la que deben tomar decisiones y eso como punto de partida ya es bastante decidor ya no hablamos de mujeres que est n en segundo plano donde las opciones ni siquiera se le son planteadas estas son tipas recias que para bien o para mal tienen el control sobre sus vidas las mujeres ya casi no estamos en roles postegrados o inescuchados eso era antes y francamente creo que es algo que nos tenemos que quitar de encima
1037953 mira ya que hablas de mi gremio te digo que la mujer sostiene a esta sociedad jajajajajaj realmente hablando en serio y con todo lo objetiva que pueda ser la mujer venezolana es la que sostiene la familia hasta en las peores situaciones ah est para echar pa lante f jate s lo en las noticias de cr menes asesinatos morgue etc las que est n all son las madres hermanas y esposas vivimos situaciones que son para volver loco o loca a cualquiera y all est n siguen luchando para sus otros hijos e hijas la mujer venezolana es para m la gran luchadora y la gran sufriente de esta sociedad hay en estos unos matices de los que me gustar a escribir la mujer venezolana somos tambi n las responsables junto a los padres ausentes de la formaci n de tantos delincuentes al no forjar el car cter de los hijos y al permitirles todo y hacerles creer que lo merecen todo las personas que roban matan extorsionan y son corruptos vienen de una crianza y una educaci n y siento que dejan muy mal parados a los responsables de esta educaci n en particular a la madre la mujer venezolana suele ser marcada por preconcepciones de lo que es la felicidad muchas quieren ser bellas en los c nones establecidos casarse de blanco o sin blanco tener ni os y as se llenan de muchachos pensamos que para ser queridas debemos llegar a las relaciones sexuales y as acumulamos cantidad de relaciones ntimas que se traducen en enfermedades cantidad de hijos y quiebre emocional entre otras consecuencias eso sin contar el c mo una sociedad machista considera a su mujer un objeto y ah la violencia dom stica tan poco conocida pero tan extendida en nuestra sociedad la mujer venezolana a veces conoce poco sus capacidades creativas en esta sociedad de tendencia machista entonces poco se cree los alcances que como ser creativo pueda tener digo que esto es una condici n de algunas puesto que verdaderamente hay muchas mujeres que s se creen sus capacidades y hacen cosas incre bles como levantar a familias enteras a punta de oficios que a veces son muy duros quiero decir que cuando una mujer se cree su potencial creativo se pierde de vista desde hacer dulces criollos hasta hacer vida en el mundo de investigaci n cient fica etc y creo que en ese terreno nos falta cre rrnoslo mucho m s saber que s es posible montar la f brica de chocolates hacer nuestros tejidos con lana hacer una campa a educativa para fomentar los valores de ciudadan a hacer pel culas en fin muchas venezolanas nos han dado el ejemplo estos aspectos los tocan los autores de los tres guiones de 1 2 y 3 mujeres y todo el equipo envuelto en la concepci n de la pel cula estamos conscientes de estos temas y queremos provocar reflexi n alrededor de ellos
1037954 seas mujer u hombre antes era muy dif cil hacer una pel cula aqu sin tener que vender tu carro o esperar a os para terminar la post producci n creo que todo se resume a que en este momento en venezuela hay un gran apoyo al cine nacional y eso por supuesto que te eleva las estad sticas a todo el mundo se le est n abriendo puertas sin importar tu g nero
1037955 no s c mo era la situaci n antes viv mucho tiempo fuera de venezuela hasta hace dos a os que regres supongo que hay muchos prejuicios con respecto a las mujeres sin embargo te doy mi apreciaci n hacer cine requiere de un enorme esfuerzo paciencia y fe si es cine independiente en el que uno mismo gestiona los recursos a n m s y hace falta una cualidad que si se quiere es bastante masculina y es el precipitar que las condiciones se den para efectivamente rodar es la cualidad que hace que si realmente quieres hacerlo pues te sienta y escribes y acumulas tus fuerzas para como sea agarrar una c mara y rodar una como mujer se pone en su rol de diana o artemisa y se vuelve una guerrera pues es muy dif cil tanto para mujeres como para hombres poner juntas las condiciones para efectivamente rodar tu proyecto compatibilizar tus otros roles como madre amante ciudadana y realizadora es todo un arte del malabar muy dif cil ahora las puertas de oportunidades para realizar audiovisuales cine televisi n s que se han multiplicado exponencialmente tanto para mujeres como para hombres eso es una realidad muy feliz para todos tanto para trabajadores como para la sociedad toda la fundaci n villa del cine es una de esas puertas y es maravilloso que exista esa posibilidad hay una fuerza femenina mundial dir a yo que est d ndose a conocer es un movimiento que ven a gest ndose hace rato en particular las autoras que mencionas tienen un tiempo ya creando y luchando muy duro por cristalizar sus ideas ahora vale ver a nivel mundial la cantidad de directoras que han surgido con proyectos incre bles formas nicas de llegar a las intimidades como para yo decir que es una tendencia mundial el surgimiento de excelentes directoras lo que yo siempre me pregunto es si stas directoras a las que admiro tanto deben malabarear con tantos aspectos propios del g nero vidas como madres amantes etc pues a m en particular me cuesta mucho
1037956 si pero el domingo el hor scopo me dijo que no hablara de el jajajaja lo juro es en serio asi tal cual
1037957 s junto a andrea herrera y tampol n impulso creativo estamos haciendo un documental largo llamado los venezolanos es un proyecto que apoya televisi n am rica latina tal de brasil con petrobras como patrocinante de parte del presupuesto hay una versi n para la televisi n brasile a ya completada y ahora nos dedicamos a completar una versi n cinematogr fica hoy d a estamos juntando los fondos para la postproducci n para cine y esperamos estrenar hacia mayo del 2009 tambi n estoy desarrollando un proyecto documental largo llamado historias de sancocho que es una reflexi n sobre nuestro nimus actual tan cargado de propaganda y pol tica visto desde la intimidad de una familia com n mi familia este proyecto lo estoy desarrollando junto con puroojo films puroojofilms com y estamos en el pleno parto de los recursos a la manera independiente fant stico adem s de esto tenemos varios proyectos en gestaci n que incluyen dos largos de ficci n y una serie para televisi n que te conversar en su momento j y que nos mantendr n ocupados por un buen rato
1037958 esta pregunta es siempre complicada porque uno trabaja mucho hace una obra y pierde toda objetividad para m es mi ni a consentida en la que trabajamos tanto
1037959 vengan y apoyen al cine venezolano no no no no mentira mentira jajajajajajajajaja una dos y tres mujeres son reflexiones sobre algunos de los dilemas propios de nuestra condici n femenina quiz ser a muy llamativo si les dijera que son una dos y tres mujeres desnudas lo cual ser a muy atractivo pues somos hermosas pero realmente no es as una dos y tres mujeres son tres mujeres en sus dudas y actitudes frente a la vida y los problemas que ella nos trae el punto importante es que algunas de ellas toman una decisi n y otras no lo hacen lo cual me hace pensar que es fundamental el atreverse a decidir si no quedar s pensando toda la vida en el si lo hubiera hecho y eso es terrible nosotras nos lo hicimos decidimos e hicimos esta pel cula con el apoyo de la fundaci n la villa del cine si es buena o mala ya es otra cosa lo importante es que es nos lanzamos y ahora existe compartan con nosotras esas dudas y decisiones que tomamos o dejamos de tomar

1038076 tenemos mucho trabajo por delante pero lo emprendemos con much sima ilusi n
1038077 a suicide is a preventable death we need to do better
1038078 the county needs to make sure inmates are held in a safe manner
1038079 i am extremely pleased to report that these funds will be used to bolster the safety and security of our residents along one of our most difficult to defend portals our shoreline we must be active participants in our own security even as we continue to work with the united states coast guard and the department of natural resources
1038080 the addition of this emergency response vessel will allow us to better meet the needs of ourcitizens
1038081 while it is not intended to replace or supplement the enforcement role of the natural resources police or the coast guard on a daily basis it will be used in anne arundel county with other organizations to meet homeland security responsibilities on the bay
1038082 in my view the problems are not with permit office supervisors rather problems are systemic organizational and cultural and have evolved over nearly two decades county executive john r leopold has inherited some problems mr leopold doesnt strike me as one to shrink from a challenge
1038083 when we received the invitation from anne arundel league of women voters we were told that our race would be the only debate they were doing this year we fundamentally disagree with this decision anne arundel county has 4 districts 1 2 3 and 5 we believe all of the republican candidates should have the opportunity to debate their democratic opponents to only limit the debate to the cd1 race is not meeting the needs of the voters in all of anne arundel county and it is unfair to the other candidates
1038084 i believe that visitation rights health care benefits and other human relationship contracts that are taken for granted by all married people should be available to partners
1038085 most of the top banking and restructuring brands have pitched
1038086 families and small businesses all across the district feel the pain every time they refill their tanks
1038087 by stopping rampant speculation increasing domestic energy production and investing in renewable sources of energy we can ease prices in the short term and move toward energy independence in the long term
1038088 andy harris has had eight years in annapolis to be a leader on renewable energy but instead he has stood in the way of progress at every turn just this year he voted against three major bills that would have made maryland a national leader on renewable energy and energy efficiency
1038089 now hes pushing a gas tax holiday that would cost maryland 4 000 construction jobs and do next to nothing to lower prices even his own supporters at the conservative washington times have mocked that idea 2
1038090 hes also talking about opening up the maryland coast to drilling despite the fact that oil companies are already sitting on 68 million acres of untapped leases i favor expanding domestic production but we dont have to do it the andy harris way
1038091 the beneficiaries would be the oil companies not consumers the market clearing price would likely approximate the level that included the tax

1038093 no s si es m s grave pensar que lo han escrito por ignorancia o por falta de respeto a una mujer enferma y presuntamente asesinada
1038094 there are no easy fixes here and in our opinion restructuring this balance sheet will take time in what is a difficult and volatile market and would probably not come without more pain for existing shareholders
1038095 in an effort to minimize the current strain on our county budget we must look for tangible ways to conserve fuel while maintaining the level of service provided by public safety officials
1038096 frank raised more in the last quarter than he had raised in the previous 3 quarters combined meanwhile andy harris was caught lying about his fundraising strength and needed a last minute loan to bail himself out hes starting to panic when the so called favorite in a top tier race starts missing his fundraising goals hes in real trouble
1038097 frank kratovils liberal positions and close ties to gov omalley are viewed negatively among maryland voters
1038098 estos datos nos revelan dos cosas que la invisibilidad l sbica se refleja tambi n en las tasas de matrimonio y que hay comunidades donde casarse es un gesto de absoluta valent a

1038151 flags and insignia played an important part in nazi ceremonial and in the decoration of buildings the eagle topped standards carried by the sa at nuremberg rallies were reminiscent of roman legionary standards the uniformity of which hitler admired
1038152 there can be little doubt that hitlers state architecture even when seen today in photographs of architectural models conveys a sense of
1038153 the romans built arches of triumph to celebrate the big victories won by the roman empire while hitler built them to celebrate victories he had not yet won

1038183 muslims are only 4 percent of denmarks 5 4 million people but make up a majority of the countrys convicted rapists an especially combustible issue given that practically all the female victims are non muslim similar if lesser disproportions are found in other crimes
1038184 over time as muslim immigrants increase in numbers they wish less to mix with the indigenous population a recent survey finds that only 5 percent of young muslim immigrants would readily marry a dane
1038185 forced marriages promising a newborn daughter in denmark to a male cousin in the home country then compelling her to marry him sometimes on pain of death are one problem
1038186 muslim leaders openly declare their goal of introducing islamic law once denmarks muslim population grows large enough a not that remote prospect
1038187 we are simply forced to adopt a new policy on immigration the calculations of the welfare committee are terrifying and show how unsuccessful the integration of immigrants has been up to now
1038188 the number of foreigners coming to the country makes a difference
1038189 there is an inverse correlation between how many come here and how well we can receive the foreigners that come

1038229 the united states constitution plainly protects young texans right to observe a moment of silence before school each morning
1038230 in an age where children are bombarded with distractions beginning each school day with a moment of silence offers a welcome moment of thoughtful contemplation the state of texas will work diligently to defend the law and uphold the district courts decision which ruled that texas moment of silence statute is entirely constitutional
1038231 any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student
1038232 by providing a patriotic and contemplative context for the minute of silence senate bill 83 plainly serves secular rather than religious purposes
1038233 the purpose of these exercises is plain to foster patriotism and provide an opportunity for students to engage in thoughtful contemplation

1038244 we encourage all womens groups and individuals to join us at these rallies together with peaceful femininity but unshakable determination well protest this gross inequality in the law well demand that our right to go topless be recognized in accordance with the 14th amendment of the u s constitution and that all state laws be amended to reflect that right

1038268 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
1038269 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most

1038274 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

1038294 if you get an insight into the nature of the hierarchical political structures which man has invented then the mind is immediately free of them if one understands the tyranny of one leader they are tyrants because they want power position they know others do not know then one has seen the tyranny of all leaders
1038295 yes of course you are right pm imitation and conformity and the export of capitalism is another false system just like its false opposite antithesis called communism or socialism with all their totalitarianism and false strategies and different formulas hierarchical fixed systems locked in false laws against freedom for people forever
1038296 i think intelligent people forming a new society could develop fair equitable system of government using some of both of their technical ideas but not another government with a tyrant dominating everyone or a two party system like a king and a queen

1038426 ive got to get ahead and mix up my pitches more
1038427 i think i got a little predictable with what i was doing

1038430 this man has just told us a most interesting story about you
1038431 i am a police officer and your online friend goto123
1038432 thats impossible goto is a kid my age hes 14 and he lives in michigan
1038433 i know i told you all that but it wasnt true you see shannon there are people on line who pretend to be kids i was one of them but while others do it to find kids and hurt them i belong to a group of parents who do it to protect kids from predators i came here to find you to teach you how dangerous it is to give out too much information to people on line you told me enough about yourself to make it easy for me to find you your name the school you went to the name of your ball team and the position you played the number and name on your jersey just made finding you a breeze
1038434 no i live in raleigh it made you feel safe to think i was so far away didnt it
1038435 i had a friend whose daughter was like you only she wasnt as lucky the guy found her and murdered her while she was home alone kids are taught not to tell anyone when they are alone yet they do it all the time on line the wrong people trick you into giving out information a little here and there on line before you know it you have told them enough for them to find you without even realizing you have done it i hope youve learned a lesson from this and wont do it again
1038436 tell others about this so they will be safe too
1038437 oh lighten up you uptight christians its just a joke
1038438 i may not agree with what you have to say but i will defend to the death your right to say it
1038439 there are those rights that are basic human rights that everybody has rights given by god here were talking about food clothing shelter medicine heath care everybody has a right to those things
1038440 this is the biggest news for public health and hiv aids that weve had in a while
1038441 theyre still together but they dont want to promote their relationship on camera
1038442 each game is to me more important than the last were going on a long tough road trip and you want to feel good about your club
1038443 its a great time to be part of the rangers organization
1038444 in that situation i had to believe he was trying to hit me even with the bases loaded
1038445 we were leading by six runs they come inside hard three times that is the team that has hit me three times already it seemed so obvious to me
1038446 we wanted to set a tone coming into the new month and i think we did that
1038447 my fastball had a lot of life and i made a lot of good pitches
1038448 2 6 is pretty much identical to 2 5 from a plugin and theme compatibility point of view so upgrades from 2 5 should be pretty painless

1038451 defense is an asset to this club and we just didnt get it done
1038452 we just have to turn the page on this one
1038453 this team doesnt let losses bother it youve got to look at the big picture
1038454 i would be able to play if it was comfortable
1038455 the olympics is very interesting example of the clash of the old and the new world and the traditional and the new media

1038457 all you need is one case where the uninusured depositors the big deposits dont get covered and you have the potential that they start to run
1038458 to run an economy to have a function that works youve got to have a place where people can keep their money safely unfortunately the way the congress has structured it now thats not the case
1038459 youll notice that since the plan passed mortgage rates have actually risen in the country
1038460 it is a composite index drawing on 12 polls and surveys from 9 independent institutions which gathered the opinions of businesspeople and country analysts only 163 of the worlds 193 countries are included in the survey due to an absence of reliable data from the remaining countries the scores range from ten squeaky clean to zero highly corrupt a score of 5 0 is the number transparency international considers the borderline figure distinguishing countries that do and do not have a serious corruption problem
1038461 others do it too but know how to hide it better than us who brag about it
1038462 this index does not show the most or less corrupted countries but the existing perception of whos corrupted or not
1038463 the point is elsewhere greece has a serious corruption problem
1038464 it is simple greece is number 24 out of 27 period
1038465 hey the results of collaboration are higher than the sum of individual effort
1038466 not to fund the recylcing procedure anymore for this area
1038467 this corner in the earth is no better or worst than any other corner
1038468 my biggest worry is what effect will this publicity have in the next years on our children
1038469 the people who inherited this very land with tons of roman ottoman middle eastern and slavic dna in their blood
1038470 portugal with far calmer peaceful history and much better neighbours still manage to be the poorest eu 15 country poorer than grece for sure see the stats and youll know it
1038471 youre a grown up now go and live your own life
1038472 however we are underpaid in greece and as i work in a multinational company i get to collaborate with foreigners and believe me they are not as talented or as smart as we are when it comes to business but they get paid double or triple our wages
1038473 it feels good to finally say were in first place for at least a day
1038474 we cant sneak up on anybody anymore this year everybody knows we are for real this year
1038475 i think were at the point of the season where these guys all know what they need to do now
1038476 every one of them will compete every one of them will attack
1038477 notoriously teams dont play as well on the road and individuals usually dont do as well on the road but for me i feel like ive been pitching well on the road
1038478 weve just got to come out and continue playing good baseball
1038479 i got some balls up got away with a few and we made some great defensive plays i located better i used my changeup better
1038480 now you look like you have it together or are normal
1038481 oh ok bummer i cant take it back or explain it id look too needy
1038482 develop in a specific way or direction begin to grow sideways
1038483 i made some bad pitches and they hit those too
1038484 the team gave me some runs early and that made things easier
1038485 psychologically it has to be very good because we just got swept three series
1038486 if we had just won this series it would have been great but getting the sweep is a lot better because it puts some space between the days that you had that losing streak
1038487 obviously after you win the first two you want to take at least one of the last two
1038488 we did have a successful road trip but its a little disappointing after winning the first two that we couldnt pull out one of the last two games
1038489 he got us to the point where he could get us to the bullpen
1038490 he started to get more consistent especially with his fastball
1038491 i ask myself on the bench every day whats wrong with our team
1038492 we have to figure out a way to get matt a run or two

1038553 further since the herndon targets were founders of the muslim brotherhood in america and your client was at one time a member of the muslim brotherhood then if your client later quarreled with the muslim brotherhood we would have to be able to ask who at pij remained on good terms with the muslim brotherhood in order to ask about the connections between pij and the herndon targets outside of your client

1038600 you have taxpayers subsidizing the risk takers mortgage lenders which i find unacceptable
1038601 the more i think back the more reasons i think of that i oppose this on
1038602 it actually undoes some of the risk lenders took when they loaned money to these people
1038603 the only way it will cost the taxpayers money will be if the renegotiated mortgages are defaulted on
1038604 as the homes are foreclosed on then no one pays property taxes
1038605 if you dont do this bill to keep homes out of foreclosure the property taxes for everyone else will rise to make up for it the loss of revenue
1038606 my point is theres no loss of taxes under this bill

1038616 brain metastases are rarely treated with drugs because many drugs do not cross the blood brain barrier a special wall of blood vessels in the brain that prevents the passage of most foreign substances from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord
1038617 for example trastuzumab herceptin is an fda approved antibody that targets her2 and it can inhibit breast cancers growth these antibodies are too large to pass the blood brain barrier to impact the cancer cells that have migrated to the brain however our mouse model suggests that lapatinib may successfully get across if successful in humans the drug may provide a new approach to treating brain metastases
1038618 lapatinib was tested in a human clinical study of brain metastases and showed only modest results
1038619 however we asked a different question rather than asking lapatinib to melt a golf ball sized metastasis in the brain we asked if it would be more effective at preventing micrometastases or small undetectable metastases from growing into large metastatic tumors
1038620 these findings indicate that lapatinib may be beneficial in the treatment of patients with her2 positive breast cancer who may have micrometastases and are thus at risk for the development of brain metastases
1038621 the safety profile is favorable for ongoing development of pbt2 future trials that are larger and longer will establish if the effects of pbt2 on biomarkers and cognition that are reported here translate into clinical effectiveness
1038622 to go forward as an ad treatment pbt 2 must still surmount the high hurdle of additional safety and efficacy testing in large scale clinical trials if we assume that the amyloid hypothesis holds water future clinical studies with pbt 2 will not only test the mettle of metal protein attenuating compounds but also provide the first real world test of the importance of metal ion homeostasis in the pathogenesis of ad
1038623 even though we are succeeding in preventing organ rejection we havent made much progress to improve long term survival
1038624 unfortunately most kidney transplant patients will go back on dialysis in eight to ten years in part because the anti rejection drugs can be toxic to the kidneys
1038625 successful low dose regimens of tacrolimus and other anti rejection medications require highly precise ultra sensitive drug monitoring assays
1038626 at low doses even the slightest variation in blood level readings could be devastating to transplant patients the consequence for the laboratory is twofold it must have accurate precise testing for immunosuppressive drugs and tacrolimus tests that are accurate to 4 ng ml are no longer adequate
1038627 the challenge for the laboratory therefore is to assure with the utmost confidence to the physician that a tacrolimus blood level of 3 ng ml is exactly right and not 5
1038628 the functional sensitivity in our hands was 0 9 ng ml exceeding the package insert claim of 2 ng ml we are fully confident the architect tacrolimus assay meets our requirement for low level tacrolimus monitoring
1038629 the architect tacrolimus assay is the only automated transplant monitoring test that meets international standards for low level monitoring
1038630 a ganar mucho dinero aunque no ejerza una profesi n que le guste
1038631 this study was limited in its size design and goals
1038632 but if the findings seen in these post hoc analyses are replicated in the global phase 3 program it would be a validation of the amyloid hypothesis and could change how physicians approach the treatment of alzheimers disease
1038633 the clinically significant benefit seen with bapineuzumab treatment in the apoe4 non carrier subgroup is encouraging
1038634 these results across multiple endpoints are consistent with what we have seen for beta amyloid immunotherapy from animal studies through to the patients
1038635 these data represent scientific validation of our decision to move rapidly into phase 3 last year
1038636 in our phase 3 program we will learn much more since we will be able to study bapineuzumab in larger patient populations and better assess the results in apoe4 carriers and non carriers in separate trials we are encouraged by these results and well achieve greater insight as we move forward
1038637 while researchers continue to investigate amyloid as a target for alzheimers therapies it is the most mature theory being pursued we must also examine other potential avenues given the urgency of conquering this disease
1038638 we cant leave any stone unturned if we hope to aid the 5 million people currently living with alzheimers and the millions more that will be devastated by this epidemic
1038639 we must develop better treatments for alzheimers that go beyond improving symptoms to drugs that actually change the course of the disease delaying the onset of alzheimers and slowing the progression of the disease means that millions of people would not get alzheimers and that many who do get the disease might only experience mild symptoms in addition delaying the onset and slowing the progression of alzheimers in the next five years could generate billions of dollars annually in medicare and medicaid savings for nursing home care alone
1038640 while the results of the trial were certainly disappointing just because the flurizan phase iii clinical trial failed doesnt mean that other amyloid targeted therapies in the clinical trial pipeline arent valid we learn a great deal from every clinical study
1038641 there are many ways to impact amyloid and its role in alzheimers there are other drugs in development that target amyloid with mechanisms of action that are different from this one one or more of these drugs may ultimately prove successful
1038642 this was the largest and longest placebo controlled ad treatment trial ever completed
1038643 while the trial did not meet its endpoints it was well designed and executed and it provided clear answers regarding flurizans lack of efficacy and its safety
1038644 the fact that both the drug treated and placebo groups declined over the course of the trial and that the placebo treated patients declined at the expected rate shows that we can do this type of trial in people with mild alzheimers as the first trial to ever study a large population of mild alzheimers patients weve collected very valuable data on the progression of the disease in its earliest stages we are confident that the results of this study will help researchers in their quest to develop new and better treatments for alzheimers
1038645 this drug candidate in this dose in this group did not work but like much good science the study raises as many questions as it does provide answers was the dose right was the study long enough did they start the intervention early enough in the course of the disease designing and executing clinical studies that answer these questions will help us defeat alzheimers disease
1038646 the only way we are going to solve the problem of alzheimers is for scientists and companies to have the courage to make significant investments in these large scale trials which may or may not work this was a very well done study and the company and scientists are to be commended for that
1038647 these results indicate that pbt2 is having an impact on the underlying biology of alzheimers which is very exciting
1038648 this is a critical proof of concept and the safety and efficacy demonstrated by pbt2 in this study warrant evaluation in larger scale clinical trials in alzheimers
1038649 this is the first instance of a disease modifying alzheimers therapy that has attained its primary pre specified cognitive efficacy target in a clinical trial
1038650 this trial therefore provides the first clinical trial evidence that an alzheimers therapy aimed at blocking tau aggregation may be a viable disease modifying treatment we now need to confirm this in a larger phase iii trial
1038651 our results appear to meet the draft emea clinical guidelines for disease modifying therapy supported by spect and pet evidence of efficacy in brain regions heavily affected by tau pathology
1038652 were very excited by these results and we look forward to further research on this product
1038653 this is an innovative completely different approach and we believe that medical foods such as souvenaid tm can be a valuable part of alzheimers disease management were committed to a high level of scientific rigor in the next trial to further test souvenaid tm
1038654 souvenaid tm is a medical food product backed by 10 years of research much of the conceptual work and early pre clinical work was done at under professor richard wurtman and supported principally by the national institutes of health

1038674 malaysia actually remains a pretty attractive market but the recent political uncertainties make people like us hesitant to invest
1038675 it doesnt help that investors are not really going for emerging markets these days so malaysia is not necessarily a place people need to be in right now theres a lot of money sitting on the sidelines
1038676 i would say politics is the single biggest thing weighing on the market we have been a net seller since the general election in march
1038677 these acquisitions are a strategic fit for mmc as they provide us with a competitive advantage in the utilities and infrastructure businesses
1038678 the acquisitions will enable us to be an integrated water and power producer in the global arena and allow us to compete more effectively in these fast growing markets
1038679 with a comprehensive air sea and land transportation system we are optimistic that the region will become more attractive to international investors
1038680 as i have said before we want our students to win both in the classroom and on the playing field but we insist that they do it within the rules

1038692 but when it comes to paid search the fact google will benefit from all clicks its a slippery slope
1038693 somehow in context of search engine advertising search engines have gotten idea that if you ask for one thing its ok to give something else or something in addition

1038699 this state is seen as uncaring and hateful and this case is just right on the top

1038703 whether they depot operators have a legal position to charge the dgc is arguable firstly the dgc is a gate transit charge as the merchants trucks are transitting into their facility similar to what the airport is charging in the form of airport tax for airline passengers transitting and using the airport facilities
1038704 clearly in both these examples the airport and the penang port have no contract with the passenger or merchant but they both seem to have the legal basis to raise a charge to both these parties
1038705 therefore the basis for the dgc here is for maintaining the facility for the merchants trucks to transit in and out
1038706 the faltering global demand in e amp e products rang some alarm bells with volatile month on month numbers but malaysia had benefited from the high commodity prices
1038707 excluding e amp e malaysia exports posted a 11 per cent growth for the second quarter which was not so terrible
1038708 talks with these companies are in various stages and most of them are fortune 100 companies
1038709 it makes more sense for us to partner with existing players rather than setting up our own call centre as they already have the manpower and facilities to provide such services
1038710 what we will do is enhance the capabilities of these call centres and provide value add services to ensure every call that comes in meets customer requirements and gets a better response time
1038711 it is too early to talk of introducing a hybrid car in the local market i can only say that we are looking at this possibility in two to three years time before we go into mass production
1038712 to realise this we have started colloborating with several foreign oems such as bosch who are involved in producing hybrid components and system
1038713 with this collaboration we are not seeking to reinvent the wheel but only learning from them whatever technology they have can be applied to proton
1038714 the government decided about a month ago to set up a special purpose vehicle to collect the tolls
1038715 we dont see a significant negative impact on the second half though and there will be moderation
1038716 it is a one off inflation increase with the peak either in july or august there wont be a major upward revision after that
1038717 the inflation figure will not be high every month the government will do what it can to ease the peoples burden
1038718 todays rubber market was quiet as most of the buyers were unwilling to take any aggressive postions as they want to wait for prices to stabilise
1038719 many full service carriers in the region like thai airways and garuda as well as european carriers such as lufthansa and klm are already offering meal boxes especially in their short to medium haul flights consequently we decided to test this out
1038720 this hybrid approach will see the return of all time favourites such as nasi lemak and nasi goreng kampung as well as the introduction of new varieties in addition we have more menu options available and customers can now choose between an asian or western meal
1038721 our current new business premiums are some rm150 million as such this rm410 million is an aggressive target
1038722 women account about 50 per cent of malaysias population so its only natural that the first phase of the campaign is focused on women
1038723 there is still considerable volatility in oil prices the government should have waited a little longer for the dust to settle for the formula to work better
1038724 whatever savings the government made by raising the prices on june 4 should be maintained for some time instead of giving it away so quickly as some reverse in oil prices can take place should there be tensions in the middle east
1038725 bringing the price up again may not be the palatable thing to do then
1038726 in the interim period the idea of limiting and allowing the market price to determine the retail price will also see some volatility in prices which may itself may cause problems for users
1038727 its true that the political landscape is unprecedented and people dont know what will happen its then useful to look at the history
1038728 thats the period right after the 1969 racial incident and the share market actually underwent an impressive bull run that remains one of the strongest bulls in history
1038729 for the stock market what is important is the local economy and the world economy as long as malaysia is not facing a major political calamity which i dont expect to see the long term outlook for bursa malaysia is still optimistic
1038730 much of this success should be attributed to the good leadership within the company in terms of its ability to manage its finances and coming up with solid business strategies
1038731 the us regards malaysia as a partner in promoting peaceful and safe uses of technology including nuclear energy
1038732 we are in the process of extending an invitation to the prime minister datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi to join the global nuclear energy partnership gnep at its next meeting in october in paris france
1038733 asia already has japan australia and china as partners and we are also in the process of extending our invitation to thailand the philippines and indonesia
1038734 if malaysia chooses to join the partnership other member countries will offer expertise skills knowledge and financing mechanism
1038735 admittedly nuclear energy requires significant investment upfront but it will become profitable and economically viable in the long term due to reactor reliability it is also a source of clean energy
1038736 itll be 2010 before you see any real improvement overall
1038737 oh boy a little bunny rabbit just what i always wanted i will name him george and i will hug him
1038738 the federal government is trying to criminalize video because it has tremendous power to expose bad acts by the police and federal agents the best way for people to document police misconduct is to band together in video activist groups such as i witness video work in pairs or affinity groups protect their footage by making back up copies publish their work in the media or on the internet and vigorously challenge any arrests detentions and police orders to erase photos or videotapes the first amendment offers tremendous protection to people videotaping the police at work but we must fight to maintain our right to shoot
1038739 just then someone called missys name and mack recognized the voice she shrieked with delight and started to run abruptly she stopped and ran back to her daddy she made a big embrace as if she were hugging him and with eyes closed overexaggerated a kiss from the barrier he hugged her back and now mack could clearly see the voice that had called his missy it was jesus without hesitation missy leaped into his arms the voicing of their joy was a symphony to macks ears and as he watched his tears flowed freely
1038740 further to recent press speculation centrica confirms that it is in discussions with a third party with a view to centrica taking a minority ownership position in british energy subject to various conditions including this third party successfully acquiring british energy and receipt of regulatory clearances
1038741 in the event that the third party does not proceed with an offer for british energy or centricas discussions with the third party do not result in an agreement centrica might consider a number of other alternatives with respect to british energy
1038742 we should be aware that the credit crisis is not behind us yet
1038743 the main risks are execution risk in the solvency rebuilding plan the integration of the abn acquisition and market risk
1038744 we think the bulk of the effort in the coming months is going to come from the divestment of non core assets we have identified the list we have appointed investment bankers
1038745 i consider it crucial to strengthen the communication with our stakeholders and will update the market in full transparency on progress made

1038749 for this year we have allocated rm25 million and there is now a balance of rm5 million
1038750 this is a good scheme to address the issue of graduate unemployment in the country but unfortunately we have very few takers
1038751 a total of rm20 million has been allocated for this where applicants are being screened by the youth and sports ministry
1038752 it is a lucrative business but the younger generation seemed to be less interested
1038753 this strategic partnership with rhb insurance gives an opportunity for pos malaysia to offer a wide range of insurance products and services to complement our customers needs as it creates more value and gives them the convenience of a one stop centre
1038754 reasonably well albeit with less momentum than in the recent past

1038761 we are eagerly anticipating the world series of poker europe this year
1038762 we have enhanced the schedule to provide more variety and game play greatly broadened the worldwide television exposure and have brought the event under one roof to better the player experience for this prestigious and premiere event
1038763 our leicester square property provides a fitting backdrop to conduct such a prestigious event like the world series of poker europe

1038766 until the end of his days he fought for russia not only to move away from its totalitarian past but also to have a worthy future to become a truly free and democratic country we owe him a lot like millions of citizens solzhenitsyn lived through tough times he was one of the first to talk about the inhumane stalinist regime and about the people who experienced it but were not broken
1038767 solzhenitsyn was not only a great writer but also an historical figure thanks to whom millions of people found out what kind of country they lived in
1038768 solzhenitsyns books smashed stalinism as the reigning ideology of the former soviet union and notwithstanding all of stalinisms tenacity it will never be re established in our country thanks once again to solzhenitsyn
1038769 for me what was always important was his courage in looking at the past his understanding that without knowing the lessons of the past it is impossible to build the future
1038770 the two most powerful unifying impulses that impelled a phenomenon like solzhenitsyn were the struggle for human dignity under difficult circumstances and the fate of russia
1038771 only a personality like that could successfully oppose a monstrous totalitarian machine
1038772 for me aleksandr solzhenitsyn is a figure of planetary scale
1038773 a year or two or three need to pass before our society understands the true greatness of this citizen and artist
1038774 solzhenitsyn turned out to be a great person and a genuine patriot of his country
1038775 he could have lived abroad in clover rich but he wanted to return to the country because he strongly desired to reform it and he fulfilled his mission to the end of his days
1038776 sincerely wanted to see russia strong and rich but during the period of the so called democratic reformers he wound up being completely unneeded
1038777 i think that in assessing the soviet epoch he was extremely tendentious and one sided
1038778 naturally his personal tragedy was layered on these assessments but one shouldnt extend ones personal misfortunes and hardships to the creative potential of an entire great country
1038779 in our country it is very important what signals get sent the signal has now been sent
1038780 let it be understood that we must stop acting in this way
1038781 mom only liked to appear in public at full gallop
1038782 i adore artifice i always have i remember when i was thirteen or fourteen buying red lacquer in chinatown for my fingernails so i went around with these red fingernails you can imagine how that would have gone over at the brearley school then when i started going out a few years later i discovered calcimine if i was going out and i went out almost every night two and a half hours before my escort arrived id start with this huge bottle of calcimine a sponge and id be totally calcimined from the waist up out along the arms the throat etc cetera et cetera i had to do this alone because my family didnt take much interest in what i was doing then when my escort and i would get up to dance he in his black dinner jacket would be totally white i would come off on him but hed have to put up with it it meant nothing to me i looked like a lily

1038796 when you go to most chain restaurants ordering off the kids menu is a nightmare
1038797 right now kids meals are almost all unhealthy meals when they should be almost all healthy meals
1038798 at the very least restaurants should list calories on the menu so that parents can navigate through this minefield of calories and fat to find the healthy options
1038799 there have been a lot of changes to our restaurant menus especially childrens meals more and more options are available restaurants are offering low fat milk yogurt apples and vegetables as part of the childrens menu they are helping parents help their children make wise choices when they dine out
1038800 kids meals can be outrageously high in calories fat and sodium but its possible to go into just about any restaurant and cobble together a healthy meal for a child if the childrens menu doesnt look healthy you have to look elsewhere
1038801 eating out is no longer a special occasion its a lifestyle now so we have to be more selective about what we eat
1038802 this is a wakeup call that parents need to take advantage of restaurants healthier options especially if kids are going to be eating out three or more times a week
1038803 most kids dont clean their plates so they are probably not eating all these calories

1038809 i had made my life about making sure everything was done properly before i could go out or do anything for myself
1038810 she helped me understand that id withdrawn from my life forgotten how to be happy and make myself happy become the opposite of the fun loving person i used to be
1038811 and she helped me do something about it she wanted her mom back she said
1038812 i realized life really is what you make of it people tell me all the time now that im so much happier and i really am
1038813 it becomes easy to get caught up in the salacious details and drop the restraint that has marked the n amp os responsible approach to the john edwards alleged mistress
1038814 edwards is now after all a private figure and theres a point where examining his sex life doesnt serve a public interest and risks turning a respectable newspaper into the news and enquirer
1038815 the position has been a very valuable part of the newspaper but i felt the need to move the resource to another area i didnt think we should weaken the editorial voice of the newspaper
1038816 our new embed capabilities with silverlight allow our customers to automate document creation anywhere on the web
1038817 we are excited to expand how our customers can deliver document automation to their sales team and in some cases directly to their customers
1038818 as someone who has a track record of promising sexual favors you have no intention of delivering
1038819 but there was also that time after the sex toy party when you told him that your order had been held up by customs because it was illegal in some states

1038821 everyone has been very eager to help saying what a great guy heath ledger was everyone except mary kate who has refused to speak
1038822 did it come from a dealer from a friend if he had a bottle from a friend was it taken by someone else before police responded that is what is trying to be determined

1038824 how friggin cute is that little girl with her new baby
1038825 convinced that the olympic games will improve human rights in china
1038826 theres still a strong perception in the west that the chinese are oppressed
1038827 the protests weve seen about chinas human rights record ahead of the olympics will only have increased that sense
1038828 theres not much evidence here of a desire to blame china for the big global problems were currently faced with like rising energy prices or food prices
1038829 and its surprising that despite all the concern about the growth in chinas carbon emissions its people in the other big emerging economies like brazil or india that are more likely to blame china for climate change
1038830 weve seen support for globalisation drop off in recent years around the world and this may be more evidence of people in the west worrying about jobs disappearing into lower wage economies in the developing world
1038831 maybe one of the most surprising things in the poll is that even though china as a country has been isolated from the outside world for such a long time majorities in britain the us and india still see the chinese as friendly and over half in the us and britain think that the chinese are like them

1038838 i was going through a lot of pain i didnt try anything to change my life other than dating different types of guys and conforming to their worlds
1038839 i thought i had to be artier more intellectual john believed in the jessica simpson thats within he cherished our love
1038840 he helped make me the woman i am today john is going to be an amazing man for someone but i know that i was supposed to be with someone else
1038841 my favourite story is him taking the sailors out of the pub and making sure they got back to their ship on time
1038842 from what i have read he physically pushed the sailors out of the pubs there are stories of him nudging them along the road and anyone who tried to escape was herded into the crew again until they got back to the thorrod
1038843 its better than a lassie film in many ways its an extraordinary story the average dog in my experience has a loyalty for his master and the family he lives with but bamse was a dog that appeared to have a loyalty for a wider family
1038844 he had a sphere of concern for those people that he loved and he looked after them very well
1038845 i was in a fortunate position being a gp in this town that many of my patients remembered the dog and were very keen to talk to me about it
1038846 weve got some good running backs coming in we should see them do something
1038847 we now have a talented abeit crowded backfield but it gives us insurance in case of injury i think julius jones will dominate in a zone blocking scheme
1038848 one of the things that was holding him up was that he didnt finish plays
1038849 but he seems to have matured past that to the point where now hes more aggressive hes developed a real confidence in himself and hes fun to watch
1038850 jim and i have a real good relationship and he certainly understands the situation and what his role is
1038851 as long as jim continues to handle it the way hes handling it now i dont see a problem with it everyones role on the staff is very defined ive been doing this for a long time and if i think for a second that people are drifting when im talking theyre going to have to answer to me they know that
1038852 no 1 i dont think anybodys thinking about next year
1038853 and no 2 if anybody knows mike holmgren he is a very very powerful personality person and coach he runs the show whens around hes in charge theres never any doubt about that and never any question
1038854 when i was in green bay i got to witness that they had some big personalities there like reggie white and brett favre ron wolf was the gm but there was never any question who was in charge i think its very similar now
1038855 one of the reasons i said i was not coming back was to avoid distractions
1038856 i cant very well tell the team that and then allow it to distract me thats not fair so i just want to do what i do
1038857 so we have new line coaches new running backs and new offensive linemen im encouraged by it i know well run the ball better than we did last year
1038858 i thought long and hard on how i was going to approach this thing
1038859 once you make a decision like we made then im at peace with it i really am having said that i told the team and the coaches that its business as usual
1038860 now at the end ill reflect a little bit and im sure it will be emotional for me but now im not going to be different im not going to approach it a different way im not going to treat anyone differently i expect people to listen to me the players get it and theyre all working real hard
1038861 i know that right now i am doing the right thing for right now and then im going to take some time off during that time i really have to find out how i react to that am i going to be all over the place or is it going to be fun am i going to like it
1038862 maybe i like going to my cabin or going to the beach or reading or riding my motorcycle im just going to kind of see and maybe learn some stuff about myself i havent thought about for awhile im not going to lock in anything but i am going to take some time
1038863 the new date has been set after fresh hope appeared of reaching an agreement

1038866 that an opposition victory in the 2010 voting would not be primarily because the general public likes the opposition parties but largely because the public is so fed up with the military government and its prescriptions such as the usda which is led by the likes of industry 1 minister aung thaung and information minister brigadier general kyaw hsan who are senior executives with usda
1038867 because of the late september 2007 movement the political influence of monks has become significant whether of conscious design or not
1038868 in this regard chinas genuine attitude toward myanmars greater openness is widely expected still china seems to be satisfied with myanmars present progress which favors the first to exploit the country for its own economic interests
1038869 the forthcoming election the fifth step of myanmars political roadmap is expected to be accomplished
1038870 the military government seems to have already calculated that the formation of an inefficient government would lead to yet another military coup although it would be rule based this time
1038871 we are concerned we dont know anything if these guys want to do something we dont like we will see them in court
1038872 the community just wants to know what is going on
1038873 i dont aspire to great wealth and i dont admire it and i dont intend to leave this earth as a rich man

1038905 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

1038980 its always been difficult to define an eras trends without generalizing but nowadays its difficult to even define what a trend is
1038981 its safe to say the 80s were the age of the yuppie and the new romantic while the 90s were about grunge on the streets and minimalism on the catwalks but in these tight economic times designers and shops are desperate for customers so theyre offering up lots of mini trends within trends to appeal to as wide an audience as possible its hard to pin a season down to a single idea anymore
1038982 designers are focusing more on their own brand identities despite what everyone else is doing
1038983 balenciaga marc jacobs gucci prada all have an unwavering sense of brand vision and creativity regardless of fleeting trends
1038984 with the rise of fast fashion retailers consumers have an overload of trends to choose from

1039075 solid oxide fuel cell technology requires ion conducting materials solid electrolytes that allow oxygen ions to travel from cathode to anode
1039076 the material could lead to more efficient and lower temperature solid oxide fuel cells sofcs among other applications sofc technology requires ion conducting materials solid electrolytes that allow oxygen ions to travel from cathode to anode the conversion efficiency of chemical into electrical energy is limited by the transport of oxygen anions through the electrolyte however existing materials have not provided atom scale voids large enough to easily accommodate the path of a conducted ion which is much bigger than for example an electron

1039125 the solution is not to be found in some slick pr campaign or by trying to out propagandize al qaeda but through the steady accumulation of actions and results that built trust and credibility over a time
1039126 whether osama bin laden himself is killed or captured i think is not of great consequence it would have some importance in the war of ideas but i think if he were killed or if his number two ayman al zawahiri were killed the ideology would certainly continue to survive

1039166 senator obama has not honored the promises he gave me when we met in 2006 and in his earlier letter to the school he has not given us even one shilling but we still have hope
1039167 when the us ambassador william bellamy came to visit the school for the official renaming ceremony in february 2006 we gave him two copies of the proposal one for the embassy and one to give to senator obama but we have not heard anything from either of them since
1039168 back then i was looking after 40 orphans at the orphan center
1039169 we faced a desperate shortage of money and obama told us that he especially liked special dedicated projects like ours and wanted to help we thought he would give funds to help our project but we got nothing a few months later we were forced to shut down the orphan center because of lack of funds just a million kenyan shillings 6 000 would have kept us going another year i feel disappointed that he did not come through

1039218 the biggest thing i have noticed is how relaxed everyone is in the camp the new manager has brought stability to the club that hasnt been there for two and a bit seasons we definitely feel like everyone in the club is pulling in the right direction again finally all that uncertainty is gone

1039230 as we stand here today we intend to keep both drivers
1039231 and i dont think thats ever been in any doubt to be honest
1039232 i really cant find the words to celebrate this result the best of our season we had a few difficulties in practice but during qualifying the drivers pushed themselves to the limit and things got better and better

1039235 but for sure reliability because we cannot accept to have these kind of problems even if it was only 10 kilometres from the end we cannot have this problem of reliability because we are paying too much of a price for it
1039236 on the other hand qualifying is crucial and the difference today was really the fact that on one side we were able to jump in front and do our race as we were able to do and on the other hand in the first part in the middle of the field knowing that it was really impossible to do something in spite of having the right pace
1039237 what we need to improve is looking ahead above all at the next grand prix where maybe there will be tricky conditions in terms of temperature in terms of the situation weather something like that for sure we need to prepare our cars and tyre set up maybe in a different way because we saw what we suffered for example in germany

1039254 karena itu saya mengajukan usulan topik disertasi untuk meraih gelar doktor dengan penelitian lumpur sebagai bahan pengganti semen
1039255 lalu terpikir kenapa tidak saya coba melakukan penelitian agar lumpur itu bisa bermanfaat saya melakukan penelitian bersama prof triwulan
1039256 lumpur dengan fly ash sendiri hanya berbeda pada sifat fisik karena lumpur tidak bisa serta merta dicampurkan begitu saja tapi harus ada bahan kimia sebagai aktifator
1039257 pada lumpur lapindo saat dilakukan perlakuan atau pengadukan terjadi pengentalan yang sangat cepat tapi sulit mengering ini menjadi fenomena menarik sehingga harus ada sesuatu yang perlu ditambahkan sebagai aktifator sehingga sifatnya menyamai fly ash
1039258 saya telah memilih the university of tokyo dan mungkin akan berangkat pada juli nanti
1039259 saya berharap jika penelitian ini berhasil orang tidak akan pusing lagi membuang lumpur itu tapi justru sebaliknya mereka akan mencoba untuk memanfaatkannya semaksimal mungkin

1039263 all we can identify so far is that the refuelling rig didnt go on exactly square so it was as simple as that
1039264 there doesnt appear to be anything more than that and as a result we spilled about half a litre of fuel which was quickly put out then we just used the other rig to fuel the car as normal so no harm done by anyone

1039281 o metallica nunca relacionou nenhum evento atual visualmente mas este meio corriqueiro as pessoas tem opin es firmes sobre esta guerra e n s estamos tentando evitar tudo isso a pol tica e a religi o tendem a separar as pessoas e o que estamos tentando fazer junta los com o assunto de ressentimento e perd o

1039283 pode ser em um ambiente de guerra atual mas na verdade sobre perd o e reden o e entender o que se passa pelas mentes das pessoas n s realmente achamos que esta foi uma forma pica e bela de tratar a m sica com algo que estivesse radicalmente diferente do que se trata a letra especificamente
1039284 no fim o conceito do v deo lida com a humanidade e as rela es entre seres humanos e como seu senso b sico de humanidade pode passar por cima de qualquer situa o pol tica

1039333 whats missing is the answer to what the hell are we doing out here threatening this country with all this power last night in the galley an ensign asked what right do we have to tell a sovereign nation that they cant build a nuke i mean the table got ef hutton quiet not so much because the man was asking a question that was off culture but that he was asking a good question in fact the discussion actually followed afterwards topside where someone in our group had to smoke a cigarette the discussion was intelligent but also in lowered voices its like we arent allowed to ask the questions that we always ask before combat its almost as if the average seaman or soldier is doing all the policy work

1039352 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbled or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again who know the great enthusiasms the great devotions and spends himself in a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievements and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither defeat nor victory

1039367 most interesting but i havent a clue i know that subliminal messages can be incorporated and that they have a powerful influence there are laws prohibiting it in the us but im not aware of any uses like you describe i would imagine however that it would be classified and no one without a need to know would be aware anyway if it were frequencies it would probably need to be in the audible range or they wouldnt need to mask them with other sounds

1039370 recently paid to have oncor put in underground lines along stacy road only to have coserv put up overhead lines along the same section of roadway
1039371 no solution to the problem due to the above problem and due to when the line needs to be expanded the city is faced with the choice again of paying or having the line constructed overhead
1039372 our subdivision ordinance limits the placement of above ground utilities to major thoroughfares same as frisco subdivisions are occasionally built along a major thoroughfare without power lines only to have them installed later
1039373 sometimes homeowners complain but eventually they come to understand that the utility company has the right
1039374 coserv and for that matter every other electric utility takes the position that if you want it under ground the city is expected to pay 100 of the cost
1039375 coserv has been approached by other cities we serve and asked similar questions

1039432 this land was just scrub land its not been farmed for eight or nine years so we have to cut away the vegetation the grass and all the trees and begin the cultivation process
1039433 the soil is very good and very consistent considered one of the best growing mediums in the world and the large scale this field is the size of an average farm in england

1039469 the prospect that the press might publish background stories about the jurors is not a legally sufficient reason to withhold the jurors names from the public
