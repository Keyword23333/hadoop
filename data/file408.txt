4080085 i dont know habit i guess i hate disappointing people
4080086 yeah even when they disappoint me i expect them to disappoint me it keeps me from being bitter
4080087 doesnt that make you vulnerable anyone can hurt you in that case

4080096 if you want to get out tell me i dont want to hear it from anybody else
4080097 well now that were going to play this game i think it would be proper if you wear this
4080098 yes i have to your dad already mentioned that he didnt see a ring and thats why he never knew i cant let tattina spencer be engaged and ringless it just doesnt seem right
4080099 hey no crying i didnt get down on one knee and declare unconditional love so relax
4080100 im just trying to not get you to fall in love with me most ladies do you know when i display the romantic in me
4080101 im leaving at six and im not done packing yet
4080102 ask lucia to kindly finish your packing ill see you bye
4080103 im not going i need to get this done before five i need to personally pick my clothes
4080104 first date last date on your stay here in new york before leaving for school so come on
4080105 thank you for packing her stuff lucia ill have her back in an hour
4080106 ill return her in an hour mrs spencer just a quick date
4080107 nothing grand there wont be fireworks or an orchestra for sure i just thought it wont hurt to cheer you up a bit before leaving for school
4080108 okay but it better be good if you took me away for an hour from my packing its serious you could totally compromise my style at school because lucia didnt pack all the right clothes
4080109 women and their obssession with fashion youd look good even with rags on
4080110 how would you know youve never seen me in rags
4080111 youre such a kid come on watch your step lets get going
4080112 a little bit just the basics im nowhere near a culinary genius its healthy though
4080113 it is i go here to clear my head people never notice me
4080114 i dont remember ever being here dad was always wary of parks and my mom hated this much sun
4080115 did you miss new york a lot while you were in london
4080116 every damn day i missed a lot of things about it the traffic the brooklyn bridge the noise the old places i loved i missed the people too
4080117 really how can you miss people you dont hang out with you were always distant
4080118 to you i may seem that way it doesnt mean i cant watch and like people from afar
4080119 who did you like in prep school people you remember the most
4080120 hmm tricky well i liked benedict herman my seatmate for two years because he shut up and let me go about my own business he never told on me or tried to be chummy with me i liked professor harris i think she was hot and brainy
4080121 i liked jim porter the custodian who cleaned the indoor pool he let me swim even after practice hours when i didnt want to go home yet i liked sophie johnson because she had a great mesmerizing voice i liked philip too because he was just cool and humble he didnt like showing off with the rest of the guys i liked carrol too because shes so naive its just wrong to hate anything about her
4080122 yeah i liked you you were blonde and blue eyed and beautiful and rich typically almost perfect but you were sharp tongued and smart and tough but you were kind and gentle at the same time you were prepped up to be the perfect lady and somehow you were but with a little twist you dont quite follow the rules when people expect you to yet you do things no one expects you to do
4080123 i guess its because in my head my first thought is always not what people think im supposed to though a lot of my decisions are dictated by that they come later in as a factor only after my mother or other people have hit me in the head and reminded me of it
4080124 letting the world have its way with you influencing your decisions
4080125 as my mother would say privilege has its price we pay it everyday of our lives its almost instinctive
4080126 i know that has driven me nuts a long time ago it had me scramming for the door i didnt want it i didnt want people telling me what i was supposed to do with my life
4080127 i dont think anyone was ever able to anyway not with you you always fought back against anything expected of you
4080128 a lot of rejection a lot of arguments with my father very few friends shadowy credentials into the privileged world many lonely years
4080129 not the one i wanted anyway but im fine i think the part of my life thats seeking out to turn everything in my world upside down is wrapping up life in london changed me
4080130 lets just say i realized that the best way to like yourself is to accept who you are and do the best that you can about it
4080131 im tired tatt im tired of fighting everything i always lose something in the end anyway no matter what
4080132 im sorry that i disliked you a lot and that i was mean to you
4080133 im sorry that i took out my problems on you and thank you for being good to me in the last three days or so
4080134 youre forgiven and im sorry too if id been such a jerk back then and thank you too for giving me a chance
4080135 youre officially a friend and that means i get to kick your butt if dont straighten up
4080136 how can one never guess what a bulldozer of a woman you are
4080137 coz i never make it obvious until its too late for them deal
4080138 deal and since were now officially friends and youve imposed on me already i will also kick or maybe spank your cute butt if you dont hold yourself up through all this wear shoes that will not only look pretty but will hold your ground
4080139 you know that you dont need to i know its very inconvenient ill understand if you dont visit we can go out when i come back here on some weekends
4080140 just trust me ill be there ill make time just promise to be there when i show up at least i dont know anybody in your school
4080141 maybe you should get to know some people i know some pretty girls in our class
4080142 funny my fiancee cant possibly fix me up with another girl that will just look bad
4080143 even if a guy likes the idea of three babes in each arm
4080144 come on one last hug before i let you go off to be your true wild college girl self at yale
4080145 well while im off doing that be a good boy here and try not to give my parents a heart attack
4080146 gli italiani sono incredibilmente duri contro i romeni e gli zingari

4080197 i went to see philip his father is moving him to grenada tomorrow morning pterson is devastated
4080198 listen i dont know whats happening here tattina but you cant tell your father that youre dating philip
4080199 he doesnt know that what he knows is that he saw you two making out in a car last night and that to him and the press ethan already confirmed that youre engaged you have no idea what a relief that was to your father
4080200 youve been on society pages since you were a fetus tattina
4080201 you know how the press can be do you honestly think they will buy that story theyve been trying to get dirt out of you in the last twenty one years and despite everything weve managed to keep yours and this familys name clean do you understand that
4080202 cant everyone just call it a mistake and move on
4080203 i am not engaged to ethan and i will never be
4080204 okay listen your father has always taken pride in preserving the honor of this family he has always fought against being stereotyped as one of those rich dysfunctional families portrayed by american culture we are a goddamned example of a perfect family your father survives with that he will not let the spencer name be dragged along the dirt and you are royalty for crying out loud you can never have any other reputation besides being perfect
4080205 how about that im human mother doesnt that count too
4080206 oh but honey with your privileges comes the responsibility to uphold certain things no one needs to know about philip for now let him recuperate hell be in good hands just give them a show go out with ethan give it a chance in a few months time if things dont work out then you can simply tell your father that you and ethan have both decided to part ways just dont retract everything he told the press because he will have no face to show them after that albert spencer never retracts anything he says remember that tattina

4080327 kita sedar industri buah pala merupakan produk tempatan yang tidak mendapat tumpuan selama ini menyebabkan kilang kilang yang ada di negeri ini malah di seluruh negara terpaksa mengimportnya
4080328 melalui langkah langkah yang telah dibuat untuk menggiatkan lagi penanaman kita yakin akan dapat mengurangkan import buah tersebut sebanyak 20 peratus dari luar negara
4080329 bagaimanapun ini hanya cadangan kerana ia memerlukan perbincangan menyeluruh daripada semua pihak memandangkan pulau pinang masih belum mempunyai minuman rasmi
4080330 tetapi dalam masa yang sama kajian saintifik perlu dilakukan untuk membuktikan keberkesanan jus buah pala kerana kita tidak boleh hanya bergantung kepada populariti buah ini sahaja
4080331 kami yakin dalam sedikit masa lagi kita akan dapat melihat hasilnya kerana semua ladang yang terlibat mempunyai tahap kesuburan yang sangat tinggi
4080332 setiap satu pokok pala ini mampu menghasilkan sehingga 22 kilogram buah dan kami menganggarkan hasil purata yang mampu dicatat untuk semusim selepas ini adalah kira kira 82 tan
4080333 pembangunan semula ladang buah pala ini adalah meliputi pembajaan penanaman semula dan pembersihan ladang ladang untuk memastikan hasil yang dikeluarkan berkualiti
4080334 malah melalui sgbb penduduk yang berhasrat untuk menanam buah ini dapat membelinya dengan harga serendah rm1 untuk setiap pokok serta diberi bantuan baja dan kapur bagi proses awal penanaman

4080344 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4080345 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4080346 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4080347 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4080348 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4080349 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

4080359 as rabbis from various branches of judaism we the undersigned urge public school boards to affirm their commitment to the teaching of the science of evolution
4080360 it is possible to be inspired by the religious teachings of the bible while not taking a literalist approach and while accepting the validity of science including the foundational concept of evolution it is not the role of public schools to indoctrinate students with specific religious beliefs but rather to educate them in the established principles of science and in other subjects of general knowledge

4080378 my dear krsna ever since you took your birth in this land of vrajabhumi everything appears to be glorious the land of vrndavana has become glorious and it is as if the goddess of fortune is personally always existing here but it is only we who are very unhappy because we are searching for you but cannot see you with our greatest effort our life is completely dependent upon you therefore we request that you again come to us
4080379 my dear krsna you are the life and soul even of the lotus flower that grows on the water of lakes made transparent by the clear rains of autumn although the lotus flowers are so beautiful without your glance they fade away similarly without you we are also dying
4080380 dear krsna dear friend we know very well that you are not actually the son of mother yasoda or the cowherd man nanda maharaja
4080381 dear krsna you are the killer of all the fears of the inhabitants of vrndavana
4080382 dear krsna actually we have become very lusty having been touched by your lotus feet your lotus feet certainly kill all kinds of sinful activities of devotees who have taken shelter there you are so kind that even the ordinary animals take shelter under your lotus feet your lotus feet are also the residence of the goddess of fortune yet you dance on the head of the kaliya serpent with them now we are requesting you to kindly place your lotus feet on our breasts and pacify our lusty desires to touch you
4080383 o lord your attractive eyes like the lotus are so nice and pleasing your sweet words are so fascinating that they please even the greatest scholars who also become attracted to you we are also attracted by your speaking and by the beauty of your face and eyes please therefore satisfy us by your nectarean kisses dear lord words spoken by you or words describing your activities are full of nectar and simply by speaking or hearing your words one can be saved from the blazing fire of material existence great demigods like lord brahma and lord siva are always engaged in chanting the glories of your words they do so to eradicate the sinful activities of all living entities in the material world if one simply tries to hear your transcendental words he can very quickly be elevated to the platform of pious activities for the vaisnavas your words give transcendental pleasure and saintly persons who are engaged in distributing your transcendental message all over the world are first class charitable persons

4080438 russland tendiert dazu die zentralasiatische region von direktem zugang zur weltwirtschaft zu isolieren insbesondere zur energieversorgung wenn die georgische regierung destabilisiert wird bedeutet das weitere einschr nkung f r den zugriff des westens auf baku das kaspischen meer und andere orte

4080440 es geht darum welche rolle russland im neuen internationalen system alias new world order spielen wird
4080441 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4080442 die russen die k mpfe in s dossetien absichtlich provoziert und zeitlich genau auf die zeit der olympiade gelegt dies ist ein lange geplanter versuch seitens der russen pr sident saakaschwili zu beseitigen
4080443 und ich m chte betonen dass ich kein kriegstreiber bin ich will genauso wenig einen neuen kalten krieg wie dimitri hier die russen wollen sich ihre historische hegemonie zur ckbeschaffen und dazu geh rt die ukraine und es ist kein zufall da die anderen ehemaligen sowjetrepubliken dabei zuschauen und au erordentlich beunruhigt sind w hrend putin immer weiter versucht sich eine art hegemonialterritorium zu schaffen

4080464 in the past there existed good relations between the alana ossetians and the georgians the attack of the mongol tatar hordes changed the situation
4080465 the nation of south ossetia an ancient nation with an old orthodox tradition is filled with extraordinarily warm feelings toward the brotherly serbian nation our common roots date from the scythnian sarmatian slavic times and even earlier in addition our position is ordered not only by historical and religious cultural closeness our opponents call us separatists and so we see that people in serbia are surprised by our support but as i have already said south ossetians are not separatists we were always against the dissolution of our state the ussr
4080466 we follow the events in serbia with great attention we would like very much for the serbian nation to be consolidated and we are deeply affected by the division in serbian society in contrast to the serbs among us there is complete unity

4080468 erstmal bleibt abzuwarten ob es sich nicht nur um eine blo e ank ndigung zu reinen wahlkampfzwecken handelt sondern die sp ernsthaft an einer umsetzung interessiert ist schlie lich hat die gleiche sp der zu dieser zeit auch der jetzige bundesvorsitzende faymann angeh rte das kostenlose kindergartenjahr den wiener familien wiederholt verweigert

4080470 die sterreicherinnen und sterreicher wollen keine gro e koalition nur das bz kann diese verhindern fp und gr ne werden anscheinend schon nerv s denn jetzt gibt es eine echte alternative und ein neues angebot
4080471 es ist unwahrscheinlich und unglaublich was sich die justizministerin alles einfallen l sst nur um rechtzeitig noch politisch umf rben zu k nnen
4080472 obwohl es eine innenrevision gab die der alten dienstbeh rde ein gutes zeugnis ausgestellt hat zieht die ministerin ihr vorhaben mit aller gewalt und gegen jede vernunft durch obwohl sich alle personalvertreter dagegen ausgesprochen haben und das bundeskanzleramt dies aus mangel von planstellen abgelehnt hat und das finanzministerium die finanzierung zu recht verweigert wird die demontage der justizwache aus rein parteipolitischen gr nden munter weiterbetrieben
4080473 im namen aller bediensteten sehr geehrte frau bundesministerin fordere ich sie zum nachdenken auf und appelliere an ihre vernunft oder treten sie unverz glich von ihrem amt zur ck spielen sie nicht mit den bediensteten und der sicherheit der b rger

4080488 die kleinr umigen strukturen der sterreichischen landwirtschaft sowie die hohen umwelt und tierschutzstandards sind grundlage f r die hohe qualit t heimischer lebensmittel dies wird auch von den konsumenten gesch tzt und daher sollte man mit lebensmittel preisvergleichen die weder strukturen noch standards ber cksichtigen heimische verbraucher nicht weiter verunsichern hinzu kommt dass der anteil der lebensmittel an der inflation derzeit nur mehr ein f nftel betr gt
4080489 die von konsumentenschutzseite vehement geforderten h heren standards im umwelt und tierschutz die gentechnikfreie produktion und die lkw maut in sterreich ziehen h here kosten in der heimischen lebensmittelproduktion nach sich unsere bauernfamilien bekennen sich zu diesen hohen vorgaben an standards und qualit t diese vorgaben k nnen aber nicht ohne eine abgeltung des erh hten aufwandes ber den produktpreis erf llt werden
4080490 diese unterschiedlichen konsumgewohnheiten schlagen sich selbstverst ndlich auch in unterschiedlich hohen ausgaben f r lebensmittel nieder hochqualitative frischmilch ist preislich nicht mit haltbarmilch vergleichbar
4080491 unsere milchbauern spielen in sachen qualit t ganz vorne in der europa liga doch sind sie wegen der sehr kleinen betriebsstrukturen im wettbewerb benachteiligt milcherzeugung in sterreich geh rt aufgrund der naturbedingten nachteile eu weit gesehen zu den teuren produktionslagen nur ein fairer erzeugerpreis macht es ihnen letztlich m glich auch weiterhin milchbauern zu bleiben und so die zahlreichen funktionen im sinne der gesellschaft aufrechtzuerhalten
4080492 die konsumenten bevorzugen heimische qualit t das haben sie sowohl in umfragen als auch durch ihr kaufverhalten bewiesen wer ihnen beispielsweise einzureden versucht eine milchpreissenkung w re zu ihrem vorteil verkenne sowohl gr enordnung als auch folgen eines solchen schrittes schlie lich w rde eine preissenkung um 10 cent den konsumenten j hrlich nur etwa eur 8 bis 10 bringen aber andererseits den milchbauern gro e erl sausf lle bescheren es sollte jedem klar sein dass unsere bauern die vom konsumenten gew nschte h chste lebensmittelqualit t nur dann garantieren k nnen wenn dieser leistung auch eine entsprechende gegenleistung in form eines angemessenen b uerlichen erzeugerpreises gegen bersteht lebensmittel h chster qualit t aus heimischer herkunft und unter den strengsten umweltauflagen erzeugt d rfen nicht als billig lockartikel im regal landen dagegen werden wir uns wehren weil damit die existenz tausender b uerlicher betriebe als auch arbeitspl tze im vor und nachgelagerten bereich auf dem spiel stehen

4080526 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4080527 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle

4080599 i think he deserves every year of it and then some
4080600 please your honor help us keep this monster behind bars for his lifetime
4080601 i feel he irvin should be in jail until all my heroes are dead and gone

4080603 it took a lot of guts and courage for you to do what you did its not your fault dont take the blame this is like walking down a sidewalk and a car came up and hit you live your lives like men
4080604 its unfortunate that the grant money was lost because without a doubt smoking might be the unhealthiest thing a person can do to themselves
4080605 we used that money to get information about the dangers of smoking and secondhand smoke to teens and to others in the community
4080606 secondhand smoke is bad for all of us but its especially unhealthy for children
4080607 women who smoke while they are pregnant are much more likely to give birth to an underweight baby which increases the chance of that baby having health problems
4080608 it has a negative health impact on smokers and those who are exposed to smoke and its also affecting the cost of health care for us all whether we smoke or not
4080609 im excited to work with the mt logan staff ive heard they are wonderful
4080610 i didnt anticipate when we first discussed this there would be a cost of living increase and a merit increase what i envisioned was a merit increase
4080611 i thought we wanted to get away from administrators getting what teachers get
4080612 it gives us a baseline it shows how it would work out comparatively so next year were going to see the impact the merit pay would have on each administrator and the district budget
4080613 this initiative continues the campus emphasis on making higher education accessible to area residents
4080614 for many individuals especially those who are balancing job and family responsibilities the most difficult part of pursuing or completing a college degree is taking the first step with many students uncertain if they can afford college this program is designed to eliminate that hurdle
4080615 we are confident that once in the classroom individuals will find that attaining a college degree whether it be an associate or bachelors degree is within their reach
4080616 offering a quality education that is affordable is an important principle at ou c and underpins our commitment to serving the region by making a college degree more accessible to area residents

4080624 nosotros hemos dicho que colombia no tiene conflicto interno armado y entonces voy a explicar que es una cosa t cnica es que el derecho internacional humanitario desarroll un concepto de guerra interna o de conflicto armado interno para distinguirlo de los conflictos armados entre pa ses entonces cuando dice el presidente nosotros no tenemos conflicto armado interno est diciendo que los elementos con los cuales se define la existencia de un conflicto armado interno en colombia no existen primero la existencia de un partido pol tico en armas cu l partido pol tico en armas o la existencia de un movimiento pol tico o social o econ mico segundo el control territorial pero no control territorial en el sentido de que yo estoy en la selva

4080685 we zullen eind van de week zien wie er gelijk heeft
4080686 we hebben altijd twee trajecten naast elkaar laten lopen want het weer kan nou eenmaal veranderen we hebben dus ook aan de zeilontwikkeling van de gewone gennaker gewerkt het is natuurlijk wel jammer dat het zo loopt ik had liever lichtweer gehad zodat we met dan ding hadden kunnen varen aan de andere kant hopen we normaliter op harde wind en zou dit ons droom weerbeeld zijn als we geen code zero hadden

4080738 i caught the fish right off the boat ramp at river bend and when the fish hit he started running upstream
4080739 i think if i had a 50 pounder on i could handle the rod and net myself
4080740 it really took two hands to hold onto the rod and my daughters netted many fish and she was right there on the net and did an excellent job
4080741 in the early days i used to go out with guides and i remember the big jet engines on their boats and of course those things are all outlawed these days
4080742 for the first maybe five or six years we would go out fishing with guides and then we started going to river bend in soldotna
4080743 ive caught 50 pounders and 65 pounders on the kenai and you always know you have a big fish if he starts the run upstream
4080744 just about every big fish ive ever had continues his journey upstream
4080745 now that the ladies in my life are coming along with me i have to do everything
4080746 i have to run the boat bait the lures and do all the riggings and what have you they help out with snacks on the boat thats about it

4080766 although the multimineral zorba pill was designed as a simple dietary supplement a study of first time ulcer patients who took zorba suggests that zorba actually helps prevent ulcers the study showed that only 25 percent of those ulcer patients who took zorba under a doctors direction developed new ulcers compared to a 75 percent recurrence rate among ulcer patients who did not take zorba clearly then zorba will be highly effective in preventing recurrent ulcers and if health experts inform the general public of this fact many first time ulcers can be prevented as well
4080767 rather than inserting the structure into the canopy of a single tree the structure is designed to attach itself to three trees thereby directly securing three trees per structure from logging furthermore the surrounding trees will pose a threat to the structure if felled therefore a small number of structures can secure the well being of a large area of pristine wilderness

4080868 there is no significant signature in the powder that points to a domestic source
4080869 i am happy that we have been collecting points in our games
4080870 our approach is to take each game as it comes and we are certainly not looking at the league title
4080871 the whole idea is to collect as many points as possible in the matches that we play
4080872 if we finish with the highest number of points then it means we will be crowned the champions
4080873 but as i said before we are not looking beyond the next game and if we find ourselves within reach of the championship we will try to grab it
4080874 however for now we will cross that bridge when we get there
4080875 so far we have done well and we would like it to continue like that
4080876 it will be good if we lose or win matches only on the field of play
4080877 football should be about fair play and we do not want to lose or win matches due to some external forces that come into play
4080878 as monomotapa we only have the capacity to control our own destiny of results and that will be our focus

4080925 people have strong feelings about dogs in natural areas so one of the things that i explain in the book is that you have to be responsible
4080926 the entire first chapter explains how to have a responsible dog on the trail
4080927 there are a lot of wonderful places in massachusetts where i personally love to hike but i cant take my dog there because theres wildlife or lots of families
4080928 and in the city you assume you can only go to certain dog parks but the more i got into this the more i discovered there are real jewels very close to the city limits
4080929 dogs these days often find themselves pent up inside all day waiting for their owners to get home so having a place where your dog can actually get out and be a dog is important
4080930 but when dogs are on a leash they pick up a lot of their owners fears often youll see fights between dogs on leashes because they have a higher level of anxiety than when they are off leash off leash in the woods they relax after all thats where they used to live
4080931 i heard back from them the day that my dog passed away
4080932 i was hiking with him he had cancer and he had a major heart attack basically in the middle of the woods i had to carry him out and when i got home there was the e mail from the mountaineers saying they wanted to talk to me
4080933 i got special permission in high school to go home during the day and walk him when i went to college he came with me when i went to grad school he came with me we drove across country twice together anywhere we could hike together he came it was a real love affair
4080934 she wrote this book because it was needed im all for off leash dogs and people need to know where they can take their dogs
4080935 we have weekend warriors that work all week and then play hard on weekends and their dogs may not appreciate that
4080936 like people they need to get in shape first before they take that 10 mile hike on saturday especially because dogs are really eager to please their owners theyll just keep going until they die thats partly why heatstroke is so common for dogs on the trail
4080937 the music is just so contagious and fun but its also just so poignant some of those moments about being 16 or 17 and looking at reality really hit home especially when theyre played by youths who are that age
4080938 and youve just got to see the hand jive dance scene theres some really great dancing in this show
4080939 im not willing to say until im on the ground
4080940 i have been greatly encouraged by both of them and now believe that it is time to return home and make any contribution i can to the future of my country
4080941 his absence from the country was an indictment of the government of the day i would just hope he is coming back permanently he is an enormous resource
4080942 i have no political affiliations my obligations are solely to the people of kenya particularly the poor the dispossessed and those in need
4080943 i want to see that i am praying that that has happened
4080944 i dont care about this medal i wanted gold this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure

4080989 publishers could not openly publish a work by a bourgeois author the climate at the time did not permit it
4080990 if it wasnt black it was white if it wasnt revolutionary then it was counter revolutionary
4080991 the book covers up the appeasement policies of american imperialism it maliciously distorts and smears both stalin himself and soviet foreign policy prior to the invasion by nazi germany the author is a bourgeois journalist his position and outlook are reactionary
4080992 although the authors appraisal of certain issues and individuals is imperfect and his viewpoint is different from ours this is indeed a valuable historical reference work
4080993 one of the most important historical works of our time

4081040 potatoes and carbs in general have had more than their share of bad press
4081041 because of the atkins diet people have this idea of them as being fattening obviously if we eat them as chips roast potatoes or with lashings of butter it is going to increase the fat content but in their normal state they are virtually fat free
4081042 people should be aware that potatoes are not just starchy carbs
4081043 they are an excellent source of vitamin c minerals like potassium which help control blood pressure iron and vitamins b1 and b6
4081044 eaten in their jackets or boiled in their skins potatoes are a useful source of fibre
4081045 they also have a high satiety index which means they help you feel full for longer and are therefore good for weight loss as part of a calorie controlled diet
4081046 the key thing for the older lady is to keep some volume it can help to create a really quite youthful effect but it shouldnt be too overdone not too set looking in terms of colour it should be absolutely about the individuals skintone
4081047 its a myth that as you get older you should go lighter it all depends on your skintone and about your eye colour and older ladies can still look great with richer darker tones
4081048 i am a self taught make up artist i learnt everything by practicing on my mum so i know what works on all different age groups more mature ladies should avoid shiny or oily foundations as they may look ok when they go on but after an hour its a different story
4081049 you still want enhancement so i go for a good shine on the eyes and cheeks but always use a matt oil free foundation
4081050 its not lines that age people its the shadows and the key to correcting that is to choose the right concealer and apply it carefully to dark areas like under the eyes with the eyes id go for clean tight eyeliner with vertical strokes the trick is not to go heavy on the whole eye which will look ageing

4081055 the bipartisan leadership of the u s house of representatives stands united in condemning in the strongest possible terms the recent russian invasion of the sovereign state of georgia the united states is committed to georgias absolute sovereignty and we reject the russian foreign ministers reported assertion that democratically elected president mikheil saakashvili must go this morning russian president dmitri medvedev stated that russia will cease military action in georgia and now moscow has a responsibility to follow through and remove russian troops from the country in the meantime the international community must remain vigilant in ensuring that the nations territorial integrity is restored this deplorable outbreak of violence should serve as an opportunity for the world community to re engage in negotiations to end the conflict and restore stability in this region we also need to strengthen our efforts to ensure that the needs of georgia and the georgian people are met
4081056 russian military action in georgia should be recognized for what it is an effort to intimidate georgias freely elected government and the governments of other democratic states on russias borders as well
4081057 it must be made clear to russian leaders that this kind of conduct is unacceptable
4081058 as the former chairman and a long time member of the helsinki commission i have spoken out for decades in support of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia a crucial ally of the united states
4081059 russias actions violate georgian sovereignty and should be vigorously condemned by the international community russia must halt all military operations and withdraw their troops immediately
4081060 the united states congress stands strongly with our georgian allies and their democratically elected government
4081061 russias aggression marks an important moment for the international community for the sake of democracy in the region and free nations across the world the international community must speak with one voice in condemning the actions of moscow and calling for the removal of russian troops from georgia furthermore we must remain committed to ongoing dialogue to promote peace stability and democracy in the former soviet republics
4081062 over the past week georgias long term stability and territorial integrity have been challenged by moscow while i am encouraged that president
4081063 from 2007 to 2008 michigan and the nation have shown similar labor market trends increased unemployment and job cuts

4081077 al principio el ministerio de defensa se hizo el duro y quiso presionar a rusia para que deje de ayudar a ir n y siria con el suministro de armas
4081078 es cierto que es delicado el apoyo a georgia por ordenes de arriba hemos tenido que bajar el perfil y reducir el suministro

4081120 he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season
4081121 he has worked hard in pre season and has made an impact but he has chosen to move on for the time being
4081122 not content with slaughtering the flat boys this season aidan now wants to take on the big guns at cheltenham
4081123 ivanovic has already made an agreement with ac milan and is set for a loan move with an option to a permanent transfer
4081124 donovan simmonds is coming on loan until the end of the year and well see how he performs
4081125 hes been involved with the first team but he is only 19 years of age hes a striker but i still hope to bring in another striker so thats donovan allan russell conor sammon david fernandez and danny invincibile who can play through the middle
4081126 theres no easy games in the premier league because i think st mirren equipped themselves very well on sunday and probably deserved to get something out the game against celtic
4081127 i never look at that early season form i think you have to get the first 10 games under your belt and then that usually helps before you can judge
4081128 everyone is up for it the first game of the season games are hard but we want to get another win on saturday you can look at the first games and say someone is going to struggle and someone is going to pull away but it doesnt work like that
4081129 he can do everything really and i am convinced that one day he will win the formula 1 championship
4081130 quite simply he is far above the level that he should be at for his level of experience
4081131 there is nothing he cannot do even now i am absolutely sure that vettel will be world champion one day
4081132 at the moment we are not seeing his full value
4081133 we closed an agreement with the british club for 5 5 million
4081134 in the end the deal is shipwrecked in england because you need the passport however if fernandez had his passport he would be a lazio player
4081135 i am not sure about jordi at the moment weve had him here this week and you can see hes a decent player
4081136 hes played for real madrid so you must have something about you and by all accounts he did okay at gosport the other night the lads a good player though well take it from there really
4081137 in one way it was great to get the extra week to allow the players a break but the downside is that weve lost paul

4081142 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4081143 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4081144 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4081146 it is only when the threat of popular participation is overcome that democratic forms can be safely contemplated
4081147 never have the well worn tactics of democracy promotion been applied with more devastating effect than in haiti between 2000 and 2004
4081148 was the declaration of human freedom universally consistent only in haiti was this declaration sustained at all costs in direct opposition to the social order and economic logic of the day
4081149 there is no single event in the whole of modern history whose implications were more threatening to the dominant global order of things

4081161 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4081162 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4081163 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4081164 in terms of amounts construction is the dominant field for south korean investment in cambodia in these days
4081165 once the south korea asean free trade agreement is ratified the trade volume between south korea and cambodia will be boosted immensely
4081166 we will leave only 10 armed men for each side
4081167 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4081168 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4081169 both sides agreed to redeploy the troops who are stationed in the pagoda to the lowest possible number in order to avoid confrontation with each other
4081170 more than 50 percent of the active female population contribute to the economy of their country
4081171 the problem is that this contribution is still mainly in the informal sector
4081172 the challenge cambodian women face is not just to access employment but decent better paying employment
4081173 positive trends towards greater equality include increasing girls enrolment in primary education and resulting rises in female literacy and expanded employment opportunities
4081174 if textiles goes youll have 300 000 people employed today on the road tomorrow not to mention supporting businesses large and small including mine that would also be in trouble
4081175 the attitude is very much let foreign businesses come and do it but no work has been done on paving the way and targeting what investment they want
4081176 to raise their participation in formal employment and decision making institutions women need skills and information about how markets and the law function
4081177 when you talk about increasing womens participation in the labour force you have to be very specific about what kind of participation you are talking about
4081178 are you talking about the informal sector where women are already heavily represented or 8 am to 5 pm professional jobs
4081179 we are not going to increase womens participation in professional jobs until we have things like adequate child care facilities care for older people and salaries that keep up with the cost of living
4081180 in order to participate in economic activity and contribute to the economy you have to be healthy
4081181 the high rate of maternal mortality while declining is a real concern and a real challenge we need to look at why with all the aid we have received this has not decreased more in the past
4081182 this is also a cultural problem the woman is the last to get medical attention after the children and the father they are in bad shape by the time they come to the doctor
4081183 have improved at all levels of education the female share of enrolment drops at each higher level of education
4081184 the cambodian government is committed to increasing education opportunities for women at all levels from primary school to university during the next five year mandate
4081185 we have some vocational training centres now but not enough and they are not responding to demand this is important in the context of the garment industry which we not only want to stay in cambodia but to value add and not just use labour
4081186 we are not sure about the exact numbers but they are significant
4081187 although we are concerned about the conditions some of these women face overseas we the government encourage labour migration due to the level of local unemployment
4081188 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade anonymous

4081194 the redeployment of the troops that we have agreed to will finish before the ministerial meeting on august 18
4081195 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4081196 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4081197 we are promoting and developing a strategy to increase the quality and quantity of those products

4081209 homeowners are concerned that they may be overimproving their homes relative to their neighborhood and prices in the market

4081233 this is an important medical issue and an economic issue
4081234 doctors see the impact of air pollution on our patients every day
4081235 some of the worst pollution is in rural areas because theyre downwind
4081236 we have agreed a fee with arsenal and we have now been given permission to speak to justin which we will be doing in the next 24 48 hours
4081237 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4081238 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4081239 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4081240 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4081241 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4081242 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4081243 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4081244 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4081245 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4081246 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4081247 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4081248 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4081249 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4081250 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4081251 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4081252 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4081253 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4081254 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4081255 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4081256 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4081257 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4081258 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4081259 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4081260 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4081261 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4081262 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4081263 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4081264 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4081265 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4081266 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4081267 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4081268 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4081269 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4081270 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4081271 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4081272 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4081273 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4081274 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4081275 who are open to doing something on the production side
4081276 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4081277 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4081278 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4081279 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4081280 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4081281 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4081282 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4081283 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4081284 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4081285 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4081286 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4081287 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4081288 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4081289 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4081290 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4081291 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4081292 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4081293 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4081294 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4081295 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4081296 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4081297 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4081298 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4081299 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4081300 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4081301 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4081302 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4081303 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4081304 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4081305 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4081306 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4081307 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4081308 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4081309 todo esto tiene un trasfondo que es que el hecho de que abertis no fue el adjudicatario de la extensi n satelital
4081310 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4081311 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4081312 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4081313 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4081314 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4081315 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4081316 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4081317 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4081318 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4081319 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4081320 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4081321 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4081322 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

4081365 there is no better feeling than stepping onto the podium wearing usa across your chest seeing the american flag raised and hearing the national anthem played
4081366 i can put myself in their shoes and feel the excitement all over again
4081367 the games are still very competitive across the board in all sports
4081368 being surrounded by the top athletes in the world is amazing
4081369 when youre at the olympics youre competing on the worlds largest stage
4081370 many people have never seen them before and they are excited to see one
4081371 basketball is a big part of my life and i love teaching the sport and bringing a team together

4081381 i dont consider myself very coordinated but im pretty good at yo yoing
4081382 the message is that russia has perhaps not accepted that it is time to move on from the cold war and it is time to move to a new era in which relations between states are on the basis of equality and sovereignty and economic integration
4081383 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
4081384 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
4081385 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4081386 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4081387 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for this cease fire
4081388 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4081389 nous attendons de la russie quelle respecte son engagement de cesser toutes ses activit s militaires en g orgie et nous attendons de toutes les forces russes qui sont entr es en g orgie ces derniers jours quelles se retirent de ce pays

4081392 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
4081393 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
4081394 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
4081395 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
4081396 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
4081397 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
4081398 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch

4081401 who could have sex the longest i think thats an event i can do well in

4081403 there was this young lady recently that i invited to a party but it was a party with just me and her you know what im saying
4081404 i think its sad its a sad commentary on whoevers responsible for doing it
4081405 they dont need things like this to put a blight on their life they have enough to contend with now
4081406 people are dismayed not necessarily by the extent but by the fact that anybody would do this and just drop the plants just where they were pulled
4081407 it seemed like there was an unmet need in two situations
4081408 recipients were dying while awaiting donor organs and we had children dying whose family wanted to donate and we werent able to do it
4081409 it is a much more common scenario today that it would have been even five years ago
4081410 in my opinion its an open and shut case they dont have irreversibility and they dont have death
4081411 as difficult as that was to hear this opportunity provided us with a ray of hope
4081412 at that point zachary was so sick we did have him at home but we knew it wasnt much longer

4081440 whenever the israelis come under pressure to reach a workable agreement with the arabs they come up with dramatic new distractions like resignations or early elections anything to put off a settlement
4081441 every year they promise the establishment of a palestinian state and every time something happens to derail it
4081442 its obvious the israelis are just killing time in order to maintain the status quo

4081451 singh is kinng which released last week is still going strong and would be the first choice of family audiences during the festival weekend
4081452 bachna ae haseeno is only for the young audience vis a vis god tussi great ho which is a film for the masses because of salman khans presence
4081453 there has also been no pre release tempo preceding both the films even their music has not made a mark in comparison to the music of singh is kinng that is still driving people crazy
4081454 god tussi by rumy jafry is said to be a remake of hollywood movie bruce almighty and stars salman khan and priyanka chopra in the lead amitabh bachchan too features in the movie as the almighty
4081455 god tussi will be released worldwide with around 700 prints yrf refused to divulge details regarding the prints but director siddharth anand said the movie would be released with the average print limit of the banner for a medium budget project
4081456 there is a good pre release response to all the three movies however it is true that singh is kinng is still managing high sales
4081457 singh is kinng is going strong in its second week and is expected to keep on garnering sales but we have divided our screens equally for all the three movies
4081458 we are expecting a good business with bachna ae haseeno because of the yash raj banner in comparison to god tussi great ho but singh is kinng is still getting us business of around 70 percent even on weekdays
4081459 nothing affects the ticket sales it is tough but it depends on the film if an individual has to go for a film then he or she will definitely go for it come what may
4081460 i dont fear any movie there is nobody greater than god and i have my faith in him my movie is commercial but different the audience would come to know of it when they will watch it
4081461 there are a lot of expectations from both the movies both are big projects and have big stars it would be a great holiday period and the movies are expected to do great business
4081462 however what movie fares well at the box office depends upon the content that is the driving force of a film

4081507 england havent climbed the pecking order in one day cricket sixth as much as they have in tests fifth since goals were set in 2000 while the scots have in gavin hamilton someone with a lot to offer
4081508 also they wont have to contend with paul collingwood on monday because he is suspended
4081509 gavin was probably not handled very well when he went to south africa with england and that whole period possibly set him back because hed gone on the back of such a great summer
4081510 but that still amounts to tremendous experience shared by comparatively few
4081511 for example even those who dont say very much when first in a test dressing room absorb a lot which can be later passed on
4081512 hell have more insight than anybody else in the scotland team about how england will be approaching mondays game as for england maybe nobody will yet be able to work out exactly what kevin pietersen is planning it is the case they have had their ups and downs in one day cricket and havent developed into one of the forces yet

4081523 crude futures were a little higher this morning as the bullish us report continued to lift oil markets
4081524 crude has regained some of its losses over the past few trading sessions reacting to the inventory report which showed very substantial stock draws in gasoline
4081525 concerns about the us economy and now the spread of the economic slowdown to europe and asia could push crude oil pricing to test lower lows because some of the supply issues have been discounted by the market
4081526 hes not just after the money its the confrontation and the contest he loves to humiliate the other guy
4081527 unless hes planning on grabbing a hammer to help build the new plant im not sure how icahn is going to help management get the drug to market more quickly
4081528 we have no way of knowing what his plans are
4081529 we share his interest in our shareholder value were happy to engage in dialogue with him just like with any other shareholder
4081530 drug development is almost a black art theres not much a corporate raider can do
4081531 health care investing profiting from changes in pharmaceutical biotech and health care services

4081533 the corporate manager is the guy who used to be president of the fraternity
4081534 hes a good guy you like having a drink with him but hes gonna make sure the no 2 guy is dumber than him and he makes sure the guy under him is dumber eventually youre gonna end up with a bunch of morons
4081535 it was like he was looking for ideas and strategies to come to mind staring at this ransom note
4081536 hes a funny guy but he doesnt like anyone carl grew up as a lower middle class jewish kid in queens and he felt the brahmin patrician society was looking down its nose at him
4081537 hes really devoted his life to making money and humiliating the ceos of the world because he feels they came from some kind of privileged background he didnt have
4081538 so from where i sit i dont think lilly has anything to worry about
4081539 lilly needs to keep this drug in the worst way
4081540 i think lilly is going to buy amylin if it doesnt make a move another company can come in and take byetta away
4081541 i think lilly is going to follow the same path that they did with the icos acquisition
4081542 they icahns will typically force changes the current management is unwilling to do
4081543 and he thought about it and he said my money is my army and i need my army around me he has an even bigger army around him now

4081839 150 dollars thats where the price of barrel of oil peaked this summer and its not expected to fall below 100 any time soon for most people that means misery at the petrol pump but for others its a tremendous opportunity when we think of oil in this country we think of the north sea but for a long time before it was discovered there prospectors were drilling on dry land there are recognised reserves across the uk theyre small but theyve suddenly become a lot more interesting to oil companies in the latest licensing round the government awarded 96 for new onshore projects and ministers are keen to see as much exploration for britains own carbon resources as possible

4081874 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
4081875 whats the point of replacing gordon brown with david miliband its like replacing a copy of the readers digest with an a to z of peterborough
4081876 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
4081877 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
4081878 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
4081879 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
4081880 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
4081881 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
4081882 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
4081883 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
4081884 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
4081885 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
4081886 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
4081887 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
4081888 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
4081889 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
4081890 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
4081891 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
4081892 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
4081893 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
4081894 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
4081895 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
4081896 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
4081897 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
4081898 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
4081899 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
4081900 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
4081901 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
4081902 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
4081903 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
4081904 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
4081905 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
4081906 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country

4081910 ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
4081911 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of them a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating
4081912 now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
4081913 advertising in florida whether you are online or off can be a cutthroat business and that is why you need to make sure that when you are doing florida search engine marketing that you need to get it right if you have a web presence make sure that you are

4081915 so many manufactured home parks are closing around the state that were losing valuable affordable housing its more cost effective to save this housing than to build new affordable housing
4081916 i would like to sincerely apologize to our viewing audience for what i said just before break
4081917 i wouldnt want to cheapen camp good days image by putting out something schlocky just to get it done
4081918 im so stressed because im the only one who can do my job
4081919 all happy people are grateful ungrateful people cannot be happy we tend to think that being unhappy leads people to complain but it is truer to say that complaining leads to people becoming unhappy
4081920 which is more satisfying that your group found the broadmoor extraordinary or that youre the one who found the broadmoor

4081929 i believe she has been connected to drugs sauciness and sexiness in equal measure though she seems like a nice girl to me
4081930 she is confusingly attractive and to people under the age of eighteen she is probably the biggest star in the world she is the madonna of tweenies
4081931 that first one they had shiloh she had sort of a marilyn monroe mouth
4081932 i dont think they should breed when their genes come together it creates a storm of attractiveness so potent that it could one day bring down the planet
4081933 the hills i believe its about some girls that go around and get off with people and wear nice dresses they have the general air of louche attractiveness and easy availability

4082054 and do not backbite one another does one of you like that he eats the flesh of his dead brother
4082055 i dont think its a bad thing because humidity tends to help my asthma i tend to run a lot better than when it is dry
4082056 im quite looking forward to that my race is at night so the temperature will have cooled
4082057 as long as i walk off the track with my head held high knowing that i gave the best performance that was in me then i think ill be happy
4082058 whenever the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam would intend to go on a journey he would cast lots amongst his wives so whoevers lot would be picked would accompany the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam
4082059 so he cast these lots on one of these expeditions and my name came up so i traveled with the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam this was after the verses pertaining to hijab were revealed and therefore i would travel in my hawdaj and be carried in it
4082060 after the expedition had finished and we were returning to madinah the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam gave orders to camp the night outside of madinah
4082061 the women could prepare themselves and the hair that needed to be removed could be removed
4082062 when the orders were given to encamp i stood up and walked away from the army to relieve myself when i returned i felt my chest and lo and behold my onyx necklace had broken and fallen so i returned to where i had been to search for it i was delayed in searching for it and in the meantime the people that were assigned to carry my hawdaj had already placed it on top of the camel presuming that i was back in it
4082063 during those days women were very thin and they had not put on a lot of weight they used to only eat a few morsels of food so the men did not question the lightness of the hawdaj when they picked it up and put it on the camel and on top of that i was a young girl so they sent the camel forward and i found my necklace after they had gone by the time i returned to the caravan camping ground there was not a soul in sight
4082064 on top of that i was a young girl still young in age
4082065 so i stayed in my place and i presumed that they would discover that i was missing and they would return for me while i was waiting in my place sleep got the better of me so i fell asleep
4082066 safwan ibn muaqqal as sulami one of the companions was lagging behind the army for some reason he was late so he was not up with the army and he walked up to my place he saw the shape of a person sleeping and when he saw me he recognized me for he had seen me before the revelation of the verses of the hijab i was woken up by his exclamation of la hawla wa la quwwatta ila billaah when he recognized me so i covered my face with my outer garment
4082067 he recognized her because he had seen her before the verses of hijab had been revealed
4082068 as soon as she saw him she covered her face with her outer garment
4082069 and i swear by allah we did not speak a word to each other nor did i hear any statement from him except la hawla wa la quwwatta illaa billaah he lowered his camel such that i could ride on it and when i mounted the camel he guided it until we caught up with the caravan while they were encamped that is where the rumors started spreading and the people that spread the rumors were destroyed the leader of them was abdullaah ibn ubay ibn salul
4082070 so we arrived in madinah but i fell ill with a fever for a whole month
4082071 after i had been cured i once exited with umm mistah aishas great aunt and the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallams first cousin towards the area that we used to relieve ourselves
4082072 what an evil thing you have said how can you curse a person who has witnessed the battle of badr
4082073 my dear child did you not hear what he is saying about you
4082074 do you give me permission to go to my parents house for i desire to verify the information from them and he agreed
4082075 i asked my mother umm ruman my dear mother what are the people talking about
4082076 my daughter be easy upon yourself by allah it hardly occurs that a wife is so beloved to her husband and she has co wives at the same time except that they talk about her
4082077 i cried that night i cried and cried until the morning came my tears could not stop nor could i taste the sweetness of sleep
4082078 they cannot be guilty they must be innocent they are your wives and we know nothing but good about them
4082079 ya rasulallah allah has not restricted matters upon you and there are plenty of women beside her ask her maidservant she will confirm what she knows about her
4082080 ya barira have you ever seen anything from aisha that will cause you to have doubts about her
4082081 by him who has sent you with the truth i have not seen anything from her what so ever that will cause me to have doubts about her except one thing except that she is a young girl who sometimes falls asleep when she is kneading the dough and when she falls asleep the lamb comes eats the dough and goes away so this is the crime that i know she does
4082082 oh gathering of believers who will excuse me from a person who has hurt me even with regards to my wives whatever i do you have nothing to blame me with now if i were to do anything to this man referring to abdullah ibn ubayy ibn salul then you cannot blame me he has affected me slandered me and he has even reached my wife can anyone blame me for anything i do to him now who will give me an excuse by allah i only know good about my wife and they have mentioned a man with her concerning whom i only know good of as well
4082083 i excuse you ya rasulallah if this person be from among the aws then i will cut his head off and if he be from among my brethren of the khazraj then command us and we will do your bidding
4082084 by allah you have lied you cannot kill him nor are you able to kill him rather had he been from your tribe you would not have liked that he be killed
4082085 saad had been before this incident a righteous man but the tribalism of the jahiliyyah overtook him
4082086 rather you are the liar and we will surely kill him you are only a hypocrite defending the other hypocrite
4082087 so i continued to cry that day and my tears would not stop flowing until i believed that my liver would split open due to my tears while i was sitting and crying my parents were with me and one of the ansar ladies asked permission to enter and started crying with me
4082088 while we were in that state the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam entered upon us said salam and sat down
4082089 stopped crying until she could not even feel a single tear in her eyes
4082090 respond to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam on my behalf answer him say something
4082091 respond to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam say something tell him i didnt do this
4082092 what can i say to the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam
4082093 i was still a young girl at that time and had not memorized much of the quran so i could not remember the name of the father of yusuf
4082094 i know by allah that you have heard these rumors and that these rumors have settled in your heart and soul and you have believed it already so if i were to tell you that im not guilty you wouldnt believe me and if i were to admit to a crime that i did not commit then you will believe me and think that i did it so all i can say to you is what the father of yusuf said patience is beautiful and allah subhaanahu wa taaalas help is sought concerning what you describe
4082095 i turned around on my bed allah knew i was innocent of this charge and i knew that allah would reveal my innocence however wallahi i never thought that allah would reveal quran concerning me i thought myself far too low in the sight of allah that allah would speak about me rather i was hoping that the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam might see in his dream something that would declare my innocence
4082096 when the revelation finished the prophet sal alaahu alayhi wa sallam started laughing out of happiness
4082097 so my mother stood up and told me stand up to thank the prophet sal allahu alayhi wa sallam
4082098 no by allah i will not stand up to him rather i will thank allah subhaanahu wa taaala
4082099 wallahi i will never give a single penny to mistah as long as i live
4082100 balaa yes of course i wish that allah forgives me wallahi i will never stop paying mistah as long as i live
4082101 the prophet sal allaahu alayhi wa sallam had already asked zainab ibn jahsh about me and she was my main rival from amongst the prophets wives
4082102 so allah saved her because of her piety but her sister hamana thought she was fighting on her behalf by spreading the slander so she was destroyed along with those that were destroyed
4082103 and the man they had accused safwan ibn muaqqil when the rumors were going on he would say subhan allah by him in whose hands is my soul i have never raised the veil of any woman in my life for at that time he had not yet been married
4082104 and do not backbite one another does one of you like that he eats the flesh of his dead brother
4082105 due regard to the likely effect of the exercise of those functions on and the need to do all that it reasonably can to prevent crime and disorder in its area including anti social and other behaviour adversely affecting the local environment
4082106 it feels great im thrilled for helena she was so worried she might not get the grades to get into university
4082107 annika would test me the night before exams and i would test her
4082108 the only reason why i did the second one is because everyone was asking for it but it notably failed
4082109 there were some funny parts in it but it got edited down too much and i was disappointed by it
4082110 for ten minutes i liked it but when i read the lyrics i thought it was sad i would like to invite her here i feel sympathetic to people like her
4082111 she could stay a week or two and discuss the big questions of life faith might be an answer for her
4082112 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4082113 we definitely went more towards some of our late 60s early 70s prog rock roots people like king crimson pfm gentle giant early genesis and of course emerson lake amp palmer a classic b 3 band and one we often get compared to both john and i as writers have many many influences weve both gone in many directions in our years of playing and a good part of that is that you have a big bag of tricks to pull from so we have a lot of things that we can reference or use as inspiration
4082114 dennis chambers man i wouldnt know where to start to tell you what records hes been on hes worked with chick corea steely dan parliament funkadelic even james brown hes just an absolute champion of the drums his jazz and funk roots are as deep as the tallest oak is tall laughs and as a person he is ego free completely selfless its an inspiration because he is just so possessed by playing music thats all he does tour and play music and even if his background is jazz he loves rock in soundcheck well play grand funk zeppelin hes not a jazz snob at all he digs so many different kinds of music and thats kind of inherent with all of us so it works out really good when we play together
4082115 well john is a real expert at the b 3 thing and you know its fallen on keyboardists shoulders to know the computer and midi stuff and hes become an expert at that too but he can also remove himself from that whole computer thing and play real heart and soul type stuff almost like gospel on the b3 its funny theres this white guy but you look over your shoulder and you think you see a black choir behind you singing laughs its really cool and a big part of that is his groove and just as a person hes really fastidious and he cares a lot about the overall sound of the band hes more of a team player than an individualist i like that a lot
4082116 well theres some of the standards like jimmy smith jimmy mcgriff jack mcduff the b 3 legends humble pie and spooky tooth traffic or some of the blind faith stuff keith emerson is the standard in the prog field but theres b 3 all through yes and even led zeppelins debut which is a great b 3 record as is hendrixs electric ladyland jon lord deep purple and ken hensley uriah heep and some of the prog guys went for a rockier grinding version of it i believe jon lord put it through a marshall but the jazz guys like jimmy smith tended to go straight or through a clean leslie cabinet
4082117 b 3 is used to designate the basic hammond sound there are several other instruments that do it like the a 100 and the m 3 but basically when you say b 3 you are talking about the hammond sound purists will bristle if i dont say whether were talking about b 3 m 3 or an a 100 but in actual fact its pretty much the same mechanics that go into creating that sound in all the hammond organs
4082118 and for a long time i remember in the late 60s and the early 70s if you didnt have a b 3 you were basically out of luck as a band everybody had to have one it was an integral a part of music in that era as the telecaster strat les paul fender p bass or ludwig drums

4082123 i was under pressure when everybody knows what the answer is and youre standing there with the clock ticking
4082124 it was one of the most horrifying scary things ive done but i did it
4082125 were in a position right now of the democrats trying to figure out what to do an energy bill that addresses the needs presented today
4082126 lets have a vote i would rather have a comprehensive energy plan speaker pelosi mentioned she would be open to more drilling and exploration we would like to follow up she should come back to the floor so then we wouldnt have to worry about the moratorium or a presidential veto
4082127 the heartland of this country that produces the food that manufactures the goods that creates the energy that gets shipped to the large urban areas cross party lines do not understand the reason we cannot use our resources responsibly
4082128 would you vote yes on a package that includes drilling
4082129 i would not it depends how the drilling is put forth but i dont that is not excluded let me say it that way it depends how that is proposed if the safeguards are there
4082130 this is the liberal coastal elites against the heartland of the u s
4082131 each ihs employee is issued approximately 3 computers per person
4082132 no one in ihs conveyed to gao that these documents were anything but newly generated documents there was no intent to deceive or mislead the investigators
4082133 as such not all concerns cited by gao in their report are current or defensible
4082134 weak internal control environment and its ineffective implementation of numerous property policies
4082135 id be furious if i had to answer for this staggering incompetence
4082136 la soberan a e integridad territorial de georgia debe ser respetada
4082137 got a call urging me to take advantage of an offer that was being extended to valuable clients
4082138 the people behind this effort want to make south dakota the first step in a long term campaign to mount a legal challenge to roe vs wade
4082139 it seems desperate to me that they would hold a press conference in washington d c
4082140 people in south dakota dont like it if they think someone nationally is trying to tell them what to do
4082141 it is a cynical effort i believe by anti choice groups to simply use the state of south dakota and the voters of south dakota to do their ultimate goal
4082142 which is to challenge the fundamental right of women in this country that supported the right decision to make these personal decisions
4082143 the first ballot measure was designed for south dakota and south dakota only
4082144 this time it is designed to go to the supreme court

4082147 ms sheehan lost her son in the iraq war and has the right as every american has to run for office

4082149 at the beginning of this year my wife told me she wired money overseas left from previous campaigns
4082150 barry was previously quite religious in islam his birth father barack hussein obama was a muslim economist from kenya before marrying ann dunham hussein obama was married to a woman from kenya who had seven children all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
4082151 we previously often asked him to the prayer room close to the house
4082152 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

4082170 he doesnt get it the mere fact that you would have someone compare the circumstances now in the past or in the future of iraq to the ending of world war ii and the ending of the korean war absolutely demonstrates a total fundamental lack of understanding of what the problems america faces
4082171 joe biden has a lot of credibility on foreign policy
4082172 but the aesthetics of what he could do on the stump and in interviews arent really a match for those of a bona fide ex general biden might leave obama better equipped to defend news cycles in which something like the south ossetia conflict is the central topic clark might actually be able to win them
4082173 from the fact the obama campaign plans on releasing the name of the veep via text message
4082174 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
4082175 going into these olympics i was shooting for the gold medal but to win any medal feels really good it feels like everything ive done over my career has paid off
4082176 im kicking myself for that im a lot better than what i showed today and i hope everyone knows that i apologize for disappointing people
4082177 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
4082178 many of these inquiries were completely appropriate however the serial nature of the contacts could be perceived as some kind of pressure presumably at my direction
4082179 todd and sarah are scratching their heads why on earth hasnt this why is this guy still representing the department hes a horrible recruiting tool you know
4082180 i love looking different at work ive usually got my hair scraped back with no make up on so its nice to dress up
4082181 i like to look a certain way fit and healthy but theres no competition between the girls
4082182 theyre all gorgeous so it would be silly to get jealous
4082183 bevs really shocked by just how hard times are on
4082184 bevs a businesswoman and hasnt had the easiest time while she understands the problems bosses face its making life very difficult
4082185 contracts come up for renewal at different times characters with less air time are really going to struggle

4082187 an estimated 2 725 young people call childline each year because they are the victims of homophobic bullying and violence

4082189 there should be no place for hateful and extremist opinion
4082190 moreover to have a member of parliament advocate them must certainly be in violation of the mps code of conduct
4082191 the dup is committed to equality and fairness for all of our people
4082192 between acting jobs id rather get out and do other things than sit on the dole
4082193 i won a free iphone read to find out how
4082194 it was completely surreal and more than that it was quite magical
4082195 it was bigger than i expected because there are literally roads going off everywhere one minute you are at the tube station and the next you are outside the police station it literally is like a real mini village
4082196 i did feel an honour as over the years so many great iconic characters have been and gone but the square remains the same
4082197 well hes a very laid back and easy going character
4082198 he doesnt think too far ahead hes a bit of a casanova definitely a jack the lad
4082199 hes very confident and streetwise and he reads people and situations very well which allows him to get what he wants
4082200 hes been sharing a flat with three girls but is chucked out when they realise that hes been sleeping with them all
4082201 i am so grateful for michala i am just so happy to be handing the role to her
4082202 doing the duet with kylie on tour was amazing it was nice to share that i definitely want to do a duet its just about finding the right thing and the right time
4082203 people have been calling me the seniormost actor in the film i almost feel like amitabh bachchan now the others in the film are extremely good actors and not at all inexperienced
4082204 they have a lot of experience and have absolute clarity in their mind on what they want to do they are very spontaneous and we even get together very well in that way
4082205 the character in the film is just like me radhika works and keeps her relationship going simultaneously the role is very contemporary she is an effortless dresser she wears shorts and vests and uses all kinds of funky bags and accessories
4082206 i was completely pampered on the sets and have finally made two great friends in ranbir and siddharth i have not spent enough time with the girls though
4082207 i got a lot of compliments in italy for the clothes i was wearing italian men only know how to romance they are impeccably dressed with styled hair and they only want to marry you
4082208 there were two unforgettable moments for me on this tour
4082209 one the audience at all our performances was incredible and second the press in the us has been very kind and generous
4082210 when i have money i buy books when there is money left over i buy food
4082211 the expected employment generation under the new scheme would be 37 37 500
4082212 my film has grossed rs 460 480 million over the first weekend thats more than om shanti om and welcome which had the highest opening so far so obviously the film has been liked i cant please every single sikh
4082213 who are these agitators this is nothing but a shortcut to fame the boys of the sikh youth federation mustve thought that when delhis gurdwara committee protested akshay rushed to delhi in amritsar they mustve thought this is their way of getting akshay into amritsar
4082214 all the important and powerful bodies of the sikh community cleared the film what were these boys on friday protesting about they said they hadnt even seen the film they just said it was an insult to sikhism but in what way
4082215 they feel somehow their culture will be threatened when films like jodhaa akbar and singh is kinng pay homage to the people and culture of a community
4082216 they were doing bhangra with dhols after the screening they told a news channel that this was the first film in 70 years of indian cinema that had done justice to the sikh community what more endorsement for our motives can there be
4082217 the final authority on right and wrong in a film should be the censor board once the board approves all protests should be crushed with iron hands otherwise all of us should just fold up our production houses im not disrespecting sikh sentiments so please stop hounding me for nothing
4082218 we admit akshays beard shouldve been longer we added a scene where akshay says he made a mistake by trimming his beard and in the video with snoop dogg during the end titles he comes with a full beard albeit a false one
4082219 itd have taken akshay two years to grow a natural beard we had told the shiromani gurdwara prabandhak committee sgpc that the beard would be false and they had agreed
4082220 the opening of singh is kinng has been incredible business everywhere has been thundering but i can only rest easy after the first two weeks im glad that in spite of being a comedy singh is kinng isnt vulgar
4082221 i gave my director anees bazmi the freedom to do what he likes i only wanted him to tell a morally correct story i didnt want to flinch while watching it with my sons
4082222 kareenas mom babita and i constantly message one another im as much in touch with her as i am with my own mom ive met kareenas dad a few times and we get along fine
4082223 ive been a part of their family functions many times i feel very close to her family whenever shes at a family function i try to be part of it
4082224 weve learnt to be careful in our public utterances as a celebrity one has to be careful one cant sit around being offended by the public attention
4082225 the aai can create these two airports into models and compete with the private sector to develop world class airports they can even compete in the international arena
4082226 one key at a time my blogs of the past
4082227 the decision strikes us as a reasoned business one in a time of very tight dollars
4082228 this is a very chaotic person but at least she is expressing her chaos what we are seeing is expressive chaos
4082229 the coyote of the desert likes to eat the heart of the young and the blood drips down to his children for breakfast lunch and dinner and only the ribs will be broken

4082234 as a young woman whose family has personally been affected by breast cancer i am grateful for the opportunity to help raise awareness of this disease by sharing my pinkitude with young women everywhere
4082235 i hope to inspire women like myself to practice breast self awareness and to encourage them to live a healthy lifestyle i am proud to support susan g komen for the cure and their promise to end breast cancer forever
4082236 it is their right to criticise i have no right to say shut up
4082237 raised his concerns about the situation in tibet and encouraged the chinese government to engage in substantive dialogue with the dalai lamas representatives and to allow access for journalists and diplomats
4082238 during the 1950s and 60s the cia actively backed the tibetan cause with arms military training money air support and all sorts of other help
4082239 for much of the 1960s the cia provided the tibetan exile movement with 1 7 million a year for operations against china including an annual subsidy of 180 000 for the dalai lama
4082240 a lot of what we the ned do today was done covertly 25 years ago by the cia
4082241 the ned played an important role in the iran contra affair of the 1980s funding key components of oliver norths shadowy
4082242 videotaped a prisoner whose kidneys were surgically removed while he was alive and then the prisoner was taken out and shot the tape was broadcast by bbc
4082243 information dissemination that addresses the struggle for human rights and democracy in tibet
4082244 what we are seeing is civilian application of secretary donald rumsfelds
4082245 this parallel should not be surprising since the us military and national security agency subsidized the development of the internet cellular phones and software platforms

4082248 someone in a segregation box is actually observed more than those anywhere else
4082249 their care and custody does not change simply because they are in segregation
4082250 there are concerns that they could be used in places where the detainees are enclosed in extremely hot conditions it is important to know whether or not detainees are provided with food
4082251 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step
4082252 i think it was generally our opinion that hamdan made some bad mistakes in his life that led him down a path that turned out to be a bad one once he was in it i dont see that it was that easy to get out
4082253 the fact that he apologized that didnt sound like al qaida to me
4082254 if the first guy is getting a 30 year sentence what do you do for a real hard core criminal
4082255 both were children when they were taken into us custody in afghanistan in july and december 2002 respectively
4082256 their years in us detention have been an affront to human rights principles including standards governing the treatment of children in custody
4082257 they sat down and began talking to afghan officials not realising she was there unrestrained one of the officers put a rifle down she picked it up and pointed it
4082258 the interpreter lunged at her she fired off some rounds a warrant officer took a sidearm and returned fire and shot her in the abdomen
4082259 ambulatory and were she a soldier with like condition would have been returned to limited duty
4082260 the european union has this body which addresses perceived violations of the european human rights convention mr mckinnon believes his rights under that convention have been violated by the u k rulings
4082261 mr mckinnon has never been classified in that manner or treated in that manner as far as im aware
4082262 he will be treated as a normal criminal defendant in the civil court system of this country hes a run of the mill criminal with a run of the mill crime
4082263 at this point and time theres no indication the european court will give any credibility to his argument
4082264 it would be premature for him to believe that he has found a sympathetic shoulder to cry on for all the reasons he didnt prevail in the u k he shouldnt prevail there enough already mr mckinnon
4082265 spray and pray charge everybody lets go speed speed speed
4082266 it seems extraordinary to imagine that four u s agents whod gone to pick her up two military two fbi along with at least two afghan translators were somehow surprised by this woman who overpowered them grabbed a gun flipped the safety fired off a couple of shots and then could only be subdued by shots to the torso
4082267 the whole situation made it impossible for me to meet properly with my client
4082268 the abuse was horrendous it was physical as well as psychological it was torture
4082269 no information indicating this individual is connected to specific terrorist activities

4082286 not only have they dropped the safe legal and rare bullshit theyve strengthened their support for abortion rights for all women the right to access birth control and services for rape survivors theyve also supported the right of women to have a child in a way that doesnt come off as attempting to appeal to conservatives as much as it does a genuine attempt and of course only a start to employ a reproductive justice framework

4082291 kbr the defense contractor doing a lot of heavy lifting in the upholding of our occupation of iraq has banned the use of personal cell phones by its employees kbr and its previous parent company halliburton are notorious for many things one of those things is the rape and cover up of rape committed by its male employees against its female employees how are the two related
4082292 as it stands today the more than 100 000 private security contractors in iraq working for companies such as blackwater are immune from iraqi law the iraqis have long been pushing the argument that laws exist for a reason and should most especially be applied to men roaming a foreign country armed to the teeth both high profile and low profile incidents of violence have turned iraqi political opinion against the contractors
4082293 was a deliberate effort to sink an american ship and murder its entire crew
4082294 we were never to speak of it and we were to caution everyone else involved that they could never speak of it again i know that the court of inquiry transcript that has been released to the public is not the same one that i certified and sent off to washington
4082295 m scuza i c v deranjez cu aceste informa ii
4082296 this was going to be the year i won a national championship a gold medal and won a wnba championship i dont think anyone has every done that its still my goal
4082297 id be lying if i told you i played to the best of my ability the past few games
4082298 but we won and ive learned from it this is a learning experience now obviously i have room to improve
4082299 in the past ive played a lot more i think it may have been out of necessity im willing to accept my role and stay sharp and be ready when called upon
4082300 i think she has taken some time to settle in
4082301 i think every first time an olympian goes through it no matter who you are or where youve been or what level you perform at when you hear the national anthem before the first game or walk in the opening ceremonies its a different ball game theres nothing to compare it to
4082302 she started to get rolling the game before last she was a little bit out of sync in the first game
4082303 the stage being a little bigger than shes used to is enough to make her take a deep breath and say this is new youd never know shes had any adjustment issues at all as shes been quite the spark for us
4082304 its about tomorrow and getting better each day its not about now
4082305 it will not be shown live on the west coast
4082306 this is a baseless rumor and i dont know the genesis of it
4082307 the situation will remain the same as it has for all of our prime time broadcasts
4082308 the reason that were showing this in the normal prime time patterns on the west coast is because this is when the majority of people are available to watch
4082309 i was watching on my couch and i thought i could do that one better
4082310 we all saw what amir accomplished and it just made everybody work that much harder to get to his level
4082311 the legacy of amir khan is that he attracted more boxers into the gyms
4082312 then the more youve got at the base the top comes through even better
4082313 the teams been so successful that we couldnt really ask for anything else
4082314 ive been getting good luck messages all the time and that puts pressure on you and because the team has been so successful that puts pressure on you too
4082315 i think i might have paid him a bit too much respect
4082316 that enabled our boxers to have a full time life in boxing
4082317 then we went out and we boxed around the world we didnt win a lot but we didnt go on easy tours so our fighters would actually realize what its like at the top of the world stage now theyre coming through and boxing to the potential that we expect
4082318 im talking about progression with our team and weve got our big prize obviously in 2012 in london thats what our aim is we brought a very young team relatively to beijing and thats the process to lead up to 2012
4082319 im going to take a look at the video i know theres a couple things i can work on throughout semis and finals everyone is going to keep going faster
4082320 its something ive never experienced swimming two different races in the same day especially coming off such a big final
4082321 but i think i coped well got through the heats well and got a lot more in store for tomorrow
4082322 but if you dont believe youre going to swim fast and you can do it just dont come out and swim because youre not going to give yourself a chance
4082323 i dont kid myself that it will always be thus but most people recognise that what they are watching is being done by athletes who may have from time to time have entered the moral maze but have come out the right side
4082324 but we have to be mindful that that is not sustainable forever youll end up with whats happened in the states where most parents dont want their kids to play american football
4082325 parents want to know that their children are not in a predatory environment that there is a moral framework that provides a firewall between the sleazy chemist in a californian british or russian laboratory
4082326 the iaaf tests more than any other sport we dont brush our positive tests under the carpet
4082327 the average age of people watching track and field in my own country is late 50s we have had difficulty engaging a new generation
4082328 i was watching on my couch and i thought i could do that one better
4082329 we all saw what amir accomplished and it just made everybody work that much harder to get to his level
4082330 the legacy of amir khan is that he attracted more boxers into the gyms

4082338 veronica is a great starter and she has gotten better
4082339 in 2004 i didnt know what to expect i was all about enjoying the games now to come back this time it is all about business
4082340 we understand the team has apologized and meant no offense the matter rests there for the ioc
4082341 i think they meant it as a friendly thing they are really nice guys as you know they have chinese sportswear brand li ning as sponsors
4082342 i dont give more importance to it we are talking in our bid about inclusiveness we are talking about how we want to use the sports values to change to create a new model of living together in madrid we live with 190 nationalities together
4082343 was generated by the bad faith shown by several media organizations that wanted to damage the image of not only the feb but also our country and our sport
4082344 this should just be about sports without any of that other noise
4082345 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multicultural country in spain we are for sure going to apologize
4082346 we understand the team has apologized and meant no offense the matter rests there for the ioc
4082347 i think they meant it as a friendly thing they are really nice guys as you know they have chinese sportswear brand li ning as sponsors
4082348 i dont give more importance to it we are talking in our bid about inclusiveness we are talking about how we want to use the sports values to change to create a new model of living together in madrid we live with 190 nationalities together
4082349 was generated by the bad faith shown by several media organizations that wanted to damage the image of not only the feb but also our country and our sport
4082350 this should just be about sports without any of that other noise
4082351 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multicultural country in spain we are for sure going to apologize
4082352 a battle will be some sort of 50 50 situations we like to keep possession and find a rhythm and i think that will be our chance to win the game the first 10 minutes will be tough and whoever dictates the tempo has the chance to win the game
4082353 against canada we always expect a very physical game and we need to play our game and not get caught up in what their tendencies are
4082354 we play canada quite often this is the fifth time this year so you would think by now we know what to expect from them
4082355 for us to be in the olympics for the first time and to be in the quarterfinals three matches away from a medal is a great feeling
4082356 i really think that three four or five teams are still at the top at the moment and are the real contenders for the top titles but now to be at the top we teams have to work much better harder than before
4082357 some drug companies are telling plaintiffs lawyers that if they settle their cases now they wont pay as much to the plaintiffs as they would have six months ago before the supreme court announced that it would hear the wyeth case
4082358 has no connection whatsoever with bank leumi uk or its customers
4082359 the bank will do everything in its power to prove that the suspicions against friedman arose only after he was appointed to his new post and that the london posting wasnt just an attempt to pack him off abroad before the scandal broke
4082360 the audit indicates an exceptional occurrence but this will not affect the banks customers in any way further it should be noted that to the best of the knowledge of the bank material losses have not been caused to the bank
4082361 we are shocked at the news we learned to appreciate mikis work in london very soon after he arrived
4082362 we are honored nasa selected the lifepak 1000 defibrillator to protect the lives of crew members onboard the international space station
4082363 the 1000 is used by thousands of emergency responders worldwide and was designed for use in the harshest environments and situations its proven to be one of the most reliable products physio control has ever developed this space first is especially exciting for us as it underscores the many reasons customers choose lifepak defibrillators for emergency medical use
4082364 the sensors available at that time were no good for space systems because they were big quite heavy and used a lot of heating power
4082365 so we had to develop a new type of miniaturized sensor to measure re entry conditions for spacecraft the sensors had to be very small and capable of measuring oxygen at high altitudes and during re entry
4082366 it is very easy to find terrestrial applications for this miniaturized gas sensor the sensor reacts very fast and this is useful in many cases where you need to measure ambient conditions on earth
4082367 one application where the sensor is particularly useful is measurement of the human breath with this sensor we can measure oxygen carbon dioxide and the flow of human breath and obtain the results immediately something which is impossible with the conventional systems
4082368 the sensor works well with combustible gasses and can be used to optimise the burners in industrial plants and home heating systems if you place the sensor in the exhaust gases you can control the heaters in real time by using a special algorithm and ensure that the burner operates at an optimum level
4082369 this system can reduce the exhaust gases that are harmful for the environment and at the same time by ensuring the heating system works at an optimum level it can also reduce fuel consumption by about 10 to 15
4082370 we will see more technology spinning back into space in the future
4082371 concerned that this process may not be capable of providing adequate protection against hazards that will only come to light once the spacecraft is in operation
4082372 that has made some folks uncomfortable but guess what were not done yet
4082373 if we tried to please everybody the spacecraft would not get off the ground
4082374 we are honored to have someone of pattis experience join our board
4082375 as we continue to lead our industry in the commercialization of space pattis depth of experience and knowledge will be an important strategic addition to our company
4082376 i am very pleased to have the opportunity to serve on spacedevs board of directors
4082377 spacedev is playing a key role in the development of the commercial utilization of space and i am honored to be able to contribute to that mission by being a part of the spacedev team
4082378 its been an incredible 13 years at radio 1 i would like to thank the teams who have worked with me for making it such fun
4082379 of all the shows ive presented dance anthems is the one im most proud of creating and i am delighted that even in our recent late night slot we increased our audience
4082380 shes produced some of the most successful films in the world
4082381 her understanding of how big budget british films get financed out of hollywood is extensive and unique
4082382 barbara will be an enormous asset for the uk film council in our efforts to attract inward investment into the uk film production sector
4082383 in china some doctors are paid monthly when you are healthy if you are sick its their fault so you dont have to pay that month its their goal to get you healthy and keep you healthy so they can get paid
4082384 this is the first observation that really pins down that titan has a surface lake filled with liquid
4082385 detection of liquid ethane confirms a long held idea that lakes and seas filled with methane and ethane exist on titan
4082386 the fact we could detect the ethane spectral signatures of the lake even when it was so dimly illuminated and at a slanted viewing path through titans atmosphere raises expectations for exciting future lake discoveries by our instrument
4082387 the mdc remains committed to participating in any meaningful and genuine dialogue that urgently moves this process forward
4082388 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
4082389 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008 a solution that ensures tangible deliverables are put on the table of zimbabweans
4082390 we need a government that transfers power to the elected representatives of the people to carry out the peoples mandate for change
4082391 the window of opportunity for us to accelerate orion for a 2013 flight has closed
4082392 we are still confident the constellation program will make its first flight to the international space station on or before
4082393 since the programs inception nasa has been working an aggressive plan to achieve flight capability before our march 2015 target
4082394 until today this information has remained highly guarded over the past 18 months as biosolar established academic and industry credibility
4082395 now that our technology is strongly protected both domestically and abroad we are able to share this exciting news with the public
4082396 we have demonstrated that functional photovoltaic backsheets can be produced from renewable resources
4082397 we believe that the biobacksheet is a viable alternative to backsheets currently in use not only is this product produced from sustainable and renewable resources but is expected to be more cost effective than the current backsheets
4082398 also manufacturers currently enduring a six month wait for materials like duponts petroleum based tedlar protective material will undoubtedly be interested in this development
4082399 as a publicly traded company we have a responsibility to our shareholders to maximize the value of their investment with this presentation dr levy has laid out the exciting results of the past hard work this tremendous success and the positive feedback from those manufacturers who have been testing our product samples are guiding our drive to full production capacity
4082400 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
4082401 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
4082402 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
4082403 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
4082404 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
4082405 i rode this track a number of times a few years ago and really liked it its kind of similar to some of the gp circuits i have seen and that is cool were definitely tired of second and plan to be number one this time out
4082406 the final race of the season is the 8 hours at daytona explain the teams co owners michael and david lloyd
4082407 we would really like to get a stronger foothold in the standings so that we have a cushion going in doing that means winning the next two rounds and that is what we are hoping to do
4082408 and then we had a problem in the pits that lost us a little more time the crew has been working overtime to make sure that that doesnt happen again with the extra practice time at heartland park things should really be good
4082409 ive raced here a number of times and really like it in fact i won here two years ago one of the neat things about this race is we will be running on friday in the promoter practice having a full day of practice will really give both of us lots of time on the bike and will also give us the opportunity to get everything perfectly dialed
4082410 i figured that this was a good opportunity to get even more time on the track
4082411 the more time i get on the aprilia the better i will get and thats what it is all about
4082412 we are currently seven points out of the lead in sst and one point out of first in gst
4082413 winning at barber was a huge morale booster for all of us and really got us going now were ready to do it all over again at heartland park
4082414 it will be my first time on the track and my first time running with gordon it will all be new and that will make it fun im pretty much used to adapting to anything so i dont foresee any problems i missed running at barber due to a prior commitment so it was gordon and elleby who took the win i know i better have my act together as everyone on the team will definitely give me a bad time if i make a mistake
4082415 he and ryan gordon are going to make a good pair ive known ryan for a few years he actually burst on the scene in 2004 and immediately began winning he rode here and in europe and then two years ago he retired for awhile now hes back and riding for us
4082416 this time out peter friedland has a prior commitment and will unfortunately miss this round
4082417 so it is all up to me and brad we definitely want to put our ducati on the top of the podium again we like being there so that is our plan one of the good things about this race is that we have a promoters practice day on friday this will give us ample time to set up our bikes and learn the track which is cool i have ridden there before and i really like the track layout all in all this is definitely gong to be a fun event

4082426 were pleased to lead the way in adopting deviceatlas as our standard for mobile content development
4082427 dotmobis deviceatlas is unique in that it ties together the mobile content operator and handset communities and lets us create the kind of specialized content that continues to differentiate msn in the market
4082428 since implementing deviceatlas and launching our mobi site weve seen an increase in registrations interestingly customers are coming from all over the world i think that shows the power of the mobi domain in marketing a brand
4082429 deviceatlas continues to grow by the day in the number of phones and attributes that are available to developers were excited that microsoft and morodo have seen the benefits of deviceatlas in helping to resolve the issues inherent in the heterogeneous nature of the mobile handset industry
4082430 if you are unhappy about my buying those domain names then im afraid its a case of tough luck
4082431 you should have had the foresight to buy them yourselves if you wanted them
4082432 ive done nothing legally or indeed morally wrong and you can gripe all day until the cows come home about it for all i care
4082433 i dont mind the imagery of our state parliamentary leaders being up there but i do object to information being up there that is patently false
4082434 we do try and buy as many of the domain names with different suffixes that we can but its also a practical thing at the end of the day where do we stop
4082435 but the quickest easiest thing would be to reach some sort of agreement and that may involve giving him a few dollars if thats the path of least resistance
4082436 the best form of defence really us to be proactive and make sure you register all domain names well in advance
4082437 there is so much to do in so little time thats just the way it is
4082438 i would put chelsea manchester united and liverpool as favourites again to win the premier league but regarding arsenal they also have a great team but im not sure if the group have enough experience and quality to win
4082439 i see nobody else to win the premier league but tottenham surely have the quality to fight for a top four finish
4082440 i cannot really say who the surprise team will be but year after year we always wait for a better newcastle
4082441 they are a top club they have huge support and they have good players so we wait for more from them
4082442 phil scolari has not made a lot of changes since he arrived at the club
4082443 he has kept the same structure the same system and the same football he is a good leader and he can do very well
4082444 the only insight or advice i would give him ahead of his first season is that he is in a club that is ready to win
4082445 all i can say is this blows my mind because i thought all along they werent going to take it
4082446 i say this is a wonderful beginning and hopefully we can make the deal work
4082447 you cant pick up a periodical right now and not see an article about
4082448 mr x had to pay 15 000 to get his life back after he was a victim of identity theft dont let this happen to you
4082449 an estimated 655 000 iraqis have died as a result of the 2003 us led invasion
4082450 the actual death toll is in excess of 10 000 see the official records at the end of this piece given the officially acknowledged number of over 15 000 seriously wounded and a published total of 25 000 wounded overall this elevated death toll is far more realistic than the current 2 700 now being officially published
4082451 i sincerely hope this war is about terrorism and not really about oil
4082452 im not going to buy a pig in a poke and commit to retroactive immunity when i dont know what went on
4082453 i agree with anonymous on december 11th 2007 07 08 pm utc new order cheap online pill price viagra viagra viagradrugs

4082474 the approval of our offshore exploration and development contracts by the raan represents the achievement of a critical milestone in infinitys ongoing efforts to secure all of the governmental approvals necessary for us to move forward with environmental seismic and other exploration activities on our 1 4 million acre offshore concessions in the caribbean sea
4082475 we would like to thank the council members of the raan and express our appreciation for the support we have received from nicaraguas president pronicaragua the nicaraguan investment promotion agency and the ministry of energy and mines during our negotiations in recent months the citizens of nicaragua will benefit significantly if we are successful in the discovery development and production of oil and gas resources beneath our offshore concessions
4082476 the contracts must now go to the national government in managua for final review and signature by nicaraguas president which we hope will be forthcoming in a timely manner
4082477 infinity is prepared to move forward immediately with training of personnel environmental studies seismic and other exploratory activities once final approval is granted by the nicaraguan government we believe that the perlas and tyra concession blocks potentially contain substantial quantities of hydrocarbons beneath waters that range in depth from 100 feet to 300 feet
4082478 we have been in contact with a number of international oil and gas companies regarding their potential interests in working and or partnering with infinity to develop the concessions we are confident in our ability to access the resources necessary to pursue the benefits that a successful exploration and development program can bring to the citizens of nicaragua and infinitys shareholders

4082484 its hard to remember now but before social security nearly half of americas seniors lived in poverty
4082485 my grandfather franklin delano roosevelt and a majority of americans thought that was wrong
4082486 they believed that lifting our seniors out of poverty is a reflection of our nations core values
4082487 thats why my grandfather signed the social security act seventy three years ago today
4082488 back in 1935 a small minority did not share those values
4082489 our social security isnt a disgrace its a compact a trust between generations of americans
4082490 on the 70th anniversary of social security americans stood together and said no to george bushs attempt to privatize social security

4082492 the events of the second quarter have strengthened the foundation from which our transition into a full service nationwide data center maintenance and it services organization was launched earlier this year the transition is well underway with the acquisition of ccsi and the winding down of our data center hardware business which continued to negatively impact our overall results during the second quarter at the same time we have begun to de emphasize our oem wholesale remarketing of distributed computing equipment desktops notebooks servers and instead focus our sales efforts on the higher margin end user auditing and erasure services as a result our lower margin product revenues were down substantially offset by a 16 increase in services revenue which includes both our data center maintenance and end user data security and compliance services this shift will become even more apparent as we begin to recognize revenues from our ccsi acquisition overall our strategic initiatives have been orchestrated to maximize new business opportunities increase efficiencies improve margins and ensure sustained profitability
4082493 ccsis exemplary team of professionals and impressive customer base consisting of corporate educational and government entities are fertile ground for providing our full range of services which now include a network operating center noc for performance management and fault management services that are done remotely from a central location ccsi now operating through a wholly owned subsidiary of qsgi since completing the acquisition in early july has already signed four new customer agreements across its service offerings with more in the pipeline ccsi generated approximately 13 7 million in revenue in 2007 up from 11 0 million in 2006 and generated ebitda of approximately 2 1 million in 2007 as we continue to gain critical mass in the market place we are finding that more and more of our business is being derived from customer referrals and contract expansions from existing customers this appears to be a trend among both qsgis and ccsis customers we view this as validation of the quality of our services and an indication of customer satisfaction we plan to build upon this strong foundation in the months and years ahead
4082494 our recent alliance with ibm global financing igf for on site auditing and data erasure services has already resulted in a large new customer and based upon indications from ibm we continue to be hopeful it will expand in scope a pilot program with igf was initiated in april 2008 under which igf will offer its customers qsgis on site data audit and erasure services for enterprise storage systems within data centers and in the corporate environment we continue to work hard to ensure success with our pilot and we collectively feel this program will be a winner for both qsgi and ibm we have more opportunities with ibms sales force then ever and some of these are large in scope and overall program term new laws now being enforced such as the state of connecticut which recently implemented new rules with respect to data erasure and disposal further validate our services importantly we believe that ibms strong brand recognition will shorten the selling cycle for these services
4082495 even in a challenging economic environment the value proposition that qsgi offers can benefit companies seeking to cut expenses for needed it services with our expanded product offerings recurring revenue streams and new alliance with igf the foundation is now built for solid performance and steady growth in financial performance

4082535 now solomon the son of david was strengthened in his kingdom and the lord his god was with him and exalted him exceedingly

4082552 it would also have included gender impact analysis and if that had been done the proposals may well have looked very different
4082553 will widen the existing gender gap between womens and mens total incomes taxable incomes and consumable aftertax incomes they will seriously impair and destabilize the existing tax bases with the result that the government will be able to plead poverty when faced with demands for adequate childcare resources low income supports and development projects that are capable of helping n b women overcome their disadvantaged economic status
4082554 this will make it more difficult in the future for women to move toward economic equality widening the aftertax gender gap
4082555 as professor lahey concludes the government should not consider tax proposals that increase inequality between the sexes given its heavy obligations to eliminate remaining areas of disadvantage faced by n b women
4082556 women have substantially smaller incomes heavier workloads and limited access to critical resources the overall gender income gap in n b was at least 35 in 2005 and is estimated to reach 36 4 by the end of 2008 the single biggest barrier to womens economic security and equality is lack of access to adequate childcare resources unlike men with wives partners substantial numbers of women about 23 opt for part time work often in order to balance the low money return for their labour with the high after tax value of their own unpaid childcare and domestic work women who work outside the home habitually assess their earning capacity by treating childcare expenses as a cost of working which can discourage some from paid work at the same time men who expect to be able to support their families on a single income can count on the untaxed and unpaid care work of their wives partners
4082557 the proposed increase in the hst would fall more heavily on those with the lowest incomes the same group that will not be receiving any benefits from cuts to the personal and corporate tax rates from increases in tax credits and exemptions and will be exposed to carbon taxes and the inflationary effects of those taxes increasing the hst rate to 10 would produce about two thirds of the amount of revenue lost if either of the proposed cuts to personal income tax were adopted women having lower incomes spend a greater portion of it on hst taxable goods and services

4082582 mccains unquestioned bipartisan approach to finding solutions to the tough issues facing oregonians today is refreshing in a time of unmitigated partisanship and gridlock in washington
4082583 through our strong and diverse leadership team we will be able to effectively drive a message of low taxes stimulating the economy and genuine answers to health care concerns john mccain has a bold principled plan to help america move forward without bowing to ever changing political winds oregon deserves a strong president that rises above petty partisanship and puts country first

4082586 the prospect that well have more of the same that is the source of angst of many republicans around the country
4082587 leach chafee and hauser cited the presidential hopefuls approach to foreign policy and to the economy as reasons for supporting him over mccain saying the arizona senator would continue bush administration policies from the war in iraq to an unwillingness to engage enemies in direct diplomacy that have hurt americas standing in the world and its financial stability
4082588 hauser is a new york philanthropist who was a financial backer for bush in 2000 and served as a white house intelligence adviser but then endorsed democrat john kerry in 2004 owing to her opposition to the iraq war its difficult to walk away from your partys nominee but you have to put your country first
4082589 partly what is going on is that in recent years the congressional republicans in general and sen john mccain in particular have so alienated so many conservatives that some of these conservatives are like a drowning man grasping at a straw

4082605 when states are committed to tobacco control programs residents reap the positive health rewards that is why the american lung association is leading the way to make every state smokefree by 2010
4082606 states must urgently reprioritize their commitment to protect their citizens from tobacco related death and illness the emotional and economic impact this has on our country is staggering
4082607 it is now in the states hands to improve the health of our nation by going smokefree by 2010 we are here to support our legislative partners every step of the way
4082608 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4082609 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4082610 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4082611 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4082612 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4082613 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4082614 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4082615 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4082616 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4082617 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4082618 the data in the tahoe state of the lake report reveal a unique record of trends and patterns the result of natural forces and human actions that operate over time scales ranging from days to decades
4082619 these patterns tell us that lake tahoe is a complex ecosystem and it behaves in ways we dont always expect
4082620 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4082621 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4082622 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4082623 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4082624 this morning president bush expressed strong support for international efforts to broker a ceasefire in georgia and affirmed the united states commitment to georgias people and democratic government
4082625 president bush should be speaking regularly and directly to prime minister putin and president medvedev so that there is no misunderstanding of the united states position he should tell them calmly but clearly that they should expect practical and political consequences to flow from russias actions he should insist that that russia make good on its commitments to halt military actions withdraw its forces from georgia respect georgias territorial integrity and democratically elected government and accept international mediation to broker a peace agreement in south ossetia it is also critical that russia protect civilians anywhere in georgia and allow humanitarian assistance to flow promptly and safely into the country including the assistance the united states is providing
4082626 this is welcome news for the southern tiers hardworking farmers who are still struggling to recover from the devastating effects of the june storms
4082627 i am glad to see that the usda has taken the necessary steps to provide assistance to our farmers so that they will not have to stand alone in shouldering the burden of recovering from this disaster i strongly urge anybody who thinks they may be eligible for assistance from the usda to visit their local fsa office as soon as possible

4082633 agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team
4082634 john mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption shows how far he is is willing to go to win despite all of his rhetoric about reform mccains willingness to accept tainted money raised by tainted abramoff cronies like ralph reed shows that mccain simply cannot be trusted to bring change to washington politics a maverick no more the john mccain of 2000 wouldnt even consider voting for the john mccain of 2008
4082635 i welcome president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission as soon as possible we must follow this aid with broader reconstruction assistance including emergency economic loans to help the people of georgia rebuild their lives and their economy the situation is still unstable and russia must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words the united states should now join our european partners in direct high level diplomacy with both georgia and russia to seek immediate implementation of a cease fire and to achieve a lasting resolution to this crisis there must be independent monitors to verify the implementation of this cease fire and russia must not use this moment to consolidate a position that violates georgias territorial integrity or to violate the human rights of the people of georgia as we move forward the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions the loss of life over the last few days has been tragic and there are no winners in this conflict now we must rededicate ourselves to achieving a lasting peace in the region

4082663 i had a really close look and didnt recognise any buildings that i know from birmingham so i thought theres just something wrong here
4082664 im a regular visitor to the us and i thought maybe it looked a little bit like a us city i thought well actually theres a birmingham in america
4082665 so i got on to google and found a picture of the downtown area of birmingham alabama and hey presto there it was
4082666 birmingham is immensely proud of its recycling record and this leaflet has helped to get the recycling message across to thousands of our enthusiastic citizens over the last 15 months
4082667 we accept that the wrong photo was used but the text and detail contained in the leaflet is wholly correct which is the most important message

4082670 god called me to dedicate my life to young people to go among them and find them because today it is hard for young people to go to church so it has to be the church to go towards them this project was born to attract young people in the places where they normally hang out such as streets and beaches
4082671 i think it is a very good idea people dont go to church as they did before so it is now the church that goes to the people i think it is very original something new im french and im catholic but ive never seen anything like this in my life

4082684 we wish marlon all the best he is a good pro and he made a contribution last season
4082685 the reason why little yang was not chosen to appear was because we wanted to project the right image we were thinking about what was best for the nation
4082686 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4082687 lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects but in terms of voice yang peiyi is perfect each member of our team agreed
4082688 he told us there was a problem that we needed to fix it so we did
4082689 i dont know but i sure dont like those who ask that question
4082690 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4082691 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4082692 the reason was for the national interest the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feelings and expression
4082693 chen said was in fact seven year old yang peiyi who has a chubby face and uneven teeth
4082694 this was a last minute question a choice we had to make
4082695 our rehearsals had already been vetted several times they were all very strict when we had the dress rehearsals there were spectators from various divisions including above all a member of the politburo who gave us his verdict we had to make the swap
4082696 but in the end the director thought her image was not the most appropriate because she was a little too old regrettably we had to let her go
4082697 the child on the screen should be flawless in image in her internal feelings and in her expression in the matter of her voice yang peiyi was flawless in the unanimous opinion of all the members of the team
4082698 we have a responsibility to face the audience of the whole country and to be open with this explanation
4082699 we should all understand it like this it is a question of the national interest it is a question of the image of our national music our national culture
4082700 especially at the entrance of our national flag this is an extremely important an extremely serious matter
4082701 so we made the choice i think it is fair to both lin miaoke and yang peiyi after all we have a perfect voice a perfect image and a perfect show in our teams view all together
4082702 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
4082703 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
4082704 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
4082705 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
4082706 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
4082707 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
4082708 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
4082709 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
4082710 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4082711 the right information has to be given to the people
4082712 yang peiyi missed out on selection to appear at the ceremony because of her external appearance it was for the national interest
4082713 i think there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic director picked the best voice and the best performer
4082714 i think maybe on this one some people would believe that maybe it was not appropriate but the others would have said its fantastic because the performance was great
4082715 you can have different opinions but sport is exactly the same
4082716 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
4082717 i dont agree with the decision because they are kids and it may scar them for life
4082718 i think the girl with the voice should have a chance to perform at the closing ceremonies it would be a great chance for her to redeem herself to the world
4082719 chens original interview was posted on beijing radios web site sunday night by tuesday the link was shut down the chinese government routinely blocks sites that are politically sensitive or that could cause embarrassment to the countrys communist rulers lin declined to answer when asked if peiyi should be included in the closing ceremony except to say that he was not the director he said his daughter was not doing any rehearsals and that he presumed she would not be involved in the closing ceremony

4082721 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming

4082723 according to reports lin miaoke the cute seven year old who sang the national anthem was actually miming

4082728 to understand a few things but based on the information the jury received it was a fair verdict
4082729 i actually got permission to ride with the philadelphia police up and down ridge avenue
4082730 our biggest problem was dismissals kids not doing what theyre supposed to do
4082731 so i cooperated with the 5th district commander with that problems seemed to diminish because they knew somebody was watching them
4082732 in light of the criminal indictments which were returned against the parents
4082733 were really trying to come up with a clear system of accountability that parents can understand that students can click on and understand that teachers can understand
4082734 were looking at schools much more broadly than test scores
4082735 and were trying to give schools and principals a target for making accelerated progress
4082736 we hope these report cards are the beginning of a conversation at the school level about what schools value
4082737 the decision of judicial probe has been taken on the directives of chief minister mayawati
4082738 bjp and hurriyat were waiting for such a political opportunity and they are trying to encash it
4082739 trifurcation of the valley jammu for hindus kashmir for muslims and ladakh for buddhists was the ploy of the rss and bjp leader l k advani is executing the dangerous conspiracy
4082740 what even pakistan had failed to do bjp has succeeded in dividing people of the valley

4082743 hindi television serials have become one of the major sources of entertainment and advertising gateway for promoting upcoming hindi movies today according to our tv ratings viewership sees a unprecedented rise if the starcast of a film comes on a tv soap and it is informative also as people come to know about the story
4082744 when actors aamir khan and imran khan came to promote jaane tu
4082745 i strongly condemn the reign of terror let loose by the indian forces against the besieged people of kashmir
4082746 the indian government should order troops and police to refrain from using lethal force against violent protesters in jammu and kashmir unless absolutely necessary to protect life
4082747 all this crisis in kashmir has played into the hands of the separatists
4082748 it is all a huge setback for a political solution to kashmir we are back to where we were many years ago
4082749 one lesson is that the indian government cannot just allow kashmir to drift along there has been a level of simmering resentment that the government has been unwilling to deal with
4082750 the most worrying issue is kashmir seems to be returning to be a point of tension with pakistan
4082751 the peace process was for years seen through the eyes of pakistan and india kashmir was confined to being an ornament there is increased relevance being given to kashmiris
4082752 indias claim to legitimacy in kashmir rests on the holding of free and fair elections the last election had more than 40 percent participation what happens if a separatist boycott leads to 7 8 percent participation
4082753 the special hearing date will allow the board to conclude the case that day and render its decision promptly
4082754 i think its time to air all these issues before the zoning board and let them make a decision
4082755 these kinds of allegations are taken very seriously by the administration so a prompt outcome is expected
4082756 and should the allegations be substantiated serious consequences will follow
4082757 i dont think we are going to re ignite the cold war
4082758 president bushs decision to send aid to the people of georgia and americans stand united in support of the men and women who will carry out this humanitarian mission
4082759 must back up its commitment to stop its violence and violation of georgias sovereignty with actions not just words
4082760 the united states and europe must review our multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia in light of its actions
4082761 will now need to review the full range of our relations
4082762 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
4082763 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
4082764 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party

4082793 the idea of doing another tour with nothing new to offer was something that enthused none of us and the idea of rebooting on a productive strand is something were not quite ready to face just yet
4082794 the last few months of inactivity has led us all on paths away from the band i know that sounds odd having released an album only a few months ago but i dont think any of us were connected to the mechanics of its release i dont know how it happened but i want to thank all our management the guys and gals at cooking vinyl and all the other people who worked on the record for putting all their efforts into the release of life processes and apologise for our complete failure to engage in the release of it

4082809 this will be a tough test for us make no mistake about that
4082810 john ward has done an excellent job there and they were very unlucky not to go up last season losing out to leeds in the play off semi finals
4082811 i expect them to be pushing for promotion again this time around so we will need to be on our mettle when we play them
4082812 they had a tricky match against shrewsbury in the first round and to come away from new meadow with a 1 0 victory was no mean feat
4082813 so im delighted this match will be at loftus road
4082814 i want our ground to be a real fortress this season hopefully we can get a good crowd along to back the lads and well aim to repay them with good attractive football
4082815 as i showed with my team selection against swindon on tuesday night i take this competition very seriously and will be approaching this match in the same manner
4082816 we are a wee bit away from that level there is a gulf between league one and the championship
4082817 youve got a chance in a one off game but i think over a season their level of performance will be higher than ours and thats something we can try and achieve
4082818 im pleased with how we played theyve got some quality players especially going forward
4082819 the young lad ledesma is excellent and you can see the guy theyve brought in from madrid is quality they will give teams a problem
4082820 its just disappointing it was a couple of set pieces that proved our downfall
4082821 the penny soon dropped on why he was so interested in the playing side of things it was because the trade in players formed part of his scheme to finance the new stadium
4082822 he needed money to build it and he saw the sale of stokes top players as a legitimate way of generating the cash
4082823 i got a tip off from stewart houston who was manager of queens park rangers qpr were interested in mike sheron and contact had been made between the two clubs i knew noting about it until stewart let the cat out of the bag
4082824 to break up the team that almost got us into the premiership the season before in order to pay for a move to a new ground that the club could not afford seemed to me to be inviting disaster
4082825 sheron duly left for qpr and andy griffin was sold to newcastle which brought in around 4m unsurprisingly the club went into decline stoke city news
4082826 we just have to show the character and the quality that we have got
4082827 once we win a few games we will be buzzing and flying we have got a good enough squad but we have to put results together and get on winning ways

4082870 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected

4082904 it was sold as we will put it in and it will be free
4082905 but if you put together some wi fi hot spots at the corner coffee shop that doesnt mean you can do the network for a whole metropolitan area wi fi was never designed to cover a big urban area

4082959 for three and a half weeks i was in the unique position of being on strike and being struck against by broadway stagehands at the same time
4082960 we all agreed that we had been irresponsible and that in an effort not to seem elitist we had remained quiet during this strike
4082961 we hadnt voiced our objections we hadnt put pressure on wga prez patric verrone and the other heads of the union to end this thing it wasnt a strike we were passionate about
4082962 that we feel strongly that the dga deal is fair that we should accept from the studios and networks what theyve given to the dga

4083068 y no nos exija en forma inmediata el pago de la deuda que mantenemos los trabajadores con esa entidad por falta de pago de la energ a el ctrica porque con el poco dinero que cobraremos primero tenemos que atender otras necesidades b sicas

4083322 the majority of my groups job is to work with the automakers and help them deploy hd into their radios in a much quicker time frame
4083323 multicasting simply means that a radio station can have its main station like 98 7 smooth jazz and can also have its hd radio station which is 98 7 hd2 on that station they broadcast what i call true jazz and wrif has its main station then wrif hd2 which has more local content bands
4083324 that gives them a real cool ability to program some real content
4083325 digital radio is seen as a response to satellite radio
4083326 when the satellite services launched in 2000 they did an extraordinary job of convincing everyone that terrestrial radio was a dead technology like the eight track tape so investors bailed in large numbers and radio stocks have been suffering for a long time as a result
4083327 we get a lot of questions from automakers about if we compete with satellite the answer is no they license part of our intellectual property pool
4083328 basically digital radio is like getting basic cable but its free then if you want premium content like nascar you would opt for premium subscription services like xm or sirius
4083329 the thing theyve failed to do is to give consumers a reason to buy one
4083330 they have to do something to encourage people to buy the radio and then to listen to the second station
4083331 wrif has stood out as a station thats having some success with that wrif 2 is spending time and money getting an audience a small number of devotees who are youth oriented
4083332 thats intriguing to me as someone who did morning talk shows in another century i would occasionally interview psychics and the phone never stopped ringing what i like is that its out of the box thinking you have to do something besides music its harder and harder for radio stations to hang their hat on just music because they compete with the internet and ipods
4083333 if youre lowes or home depot you wont get the audience on hgtv that you would advertising during desperate housewives but those viewers watching home and garden are a goldmine
4083334 my goal is for no one to have to ask to buy a digital radio theyll just buy a radio much the same way no one ever asks to buy a color television they just buy a tv
4083335 in 2000 we had no one in detroit we started with a small staff of three people and now were up to nine and well add a couple more this year and next year well add three to five people to our staff
4083336 theyre not necessarily auto related so theyre not as affected by the local economy as much they dont manufacture here its service based and everything is going hd so this company is going to grow
4083337 i dont see us doing it until someone comes up with a really good reason why we should
4083338 a lot of people are using hd channels to do what they really want
4083339 for the most part it is really stuff they wouldnt put on the air

4083342 i would argue that the kill switch is an innovative approach to protecting a platform in this age of criminal conspiracies to steal your personal information
4083343 i think apple has a right to protect its platform with this innovative approach
4083344 the point is the simple need for a switch like this means that
4083345 bottom line the iphone kill switch is counterintuitive sic to security not beneficial to it
4083346 while its comforting to know that a harmful application can be immediately purged from all iphones at the press of a button its a little worrying too given the level of secrecy inside apple some have speculated the company could use malicious as a blanket term to disable any applications as it so pleases
4083347 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations

4083349 the three parks being opened is based on the constitution of china that people are allowed to demonstrate if they have some issues
4083350 i think thats one step further for china to open up and i think its very good gesture
4083351 in china nobody will be persecuted or placed under house arrest because of their speech only those who break laws will be punished in accordance with the law
4083352 chinese citizens in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights and freedoms
4083353 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4083354 we can see that the petitioners who made this attempt to speak have now suffered the consequences
4083355 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4083356 position themselves in the mindset that they arent gatekeepers for information but connectors for entrepreneurs and resources for journalists

4083360 shareholders must question the utility of such constant and costly reinvention
4083361 brands offer us mental shortcuts helping us cut through the clutter of everything we buy and enabling us to communicate certain concepts quickly and easily no one wants to sift through tens of thousands of packaged foods on every trip to the supermarket instead we rely on the brands we know and branding when its consistent provides us with clarity and simplicity in a progressively hectic world
4083362 must look in the mirror and address our disorder head on
4083363 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
4083364 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
4083365 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas australian workplace agreements or work choices and our employees would get to vote on it
4083366 the appropriate role for the federal government is to move as quickly as it can to put in place the new industrial legislation and to urge all parties including telstra to live in the real world to recognise the fact that circumstances have changed and to act in good faith

4083388 since the spectrum pricing formula is auctioned to which the ministry of finance is fully agreed and the process in which the ministry of finance is fully involved we are consistent with the decision of the cabinet
4083389 it is therefore surprising that the ministry of finance has now decided to express its reservations on procedural aspects
4083390 as we promised 3g auction will take place within the scheduled time there will not be any deviation from the announced guidelines
4083391 the issue of guidelines without any consultations with the ministry of finance either within the forum of telecom commission or outside is inappropriate and contrary to the cabinet decision

4083401 sandy bruce lockhart will be enormously missed both locally in kent and more broadly in the country
4083402 he was the leading architect of the transformation and improvement in local government in recent years enhancing both the reputation and relationship of local government with national government and westminster and more widely with the electorate
4083403 driven by a love and passion for the people and the county of kent he proved that beneath his urbane charm and courtesy lay his conviction and determination to deliver what he believed was right
4083404 his knighthood and subsequent peerage were just rewards for the significant contribution he made through local government and the conservative party nationally
4083405 sandy took his skills and reputation for transformation and improvement to become chairman of the national local government association and then chairman of english heritage a job that suited his instinctive love of history and the environment
4083406 in essence put simply in all he did he was a force for good and we will all miss his wise advice and friendship very much

4083411 russia is rapidly catching up with internet and web payment technology
4083412 there are number of challenges that naturally hold back the online travel shopping
4083413 plus the fact russians still require visa to travel nearly to every foreign destination majority of customers are forced to book their trips through traditional offline agents in order to be able to apply for visa as a result of visa regulations for russians the last minute air or travel package offers are nearly non existent except for turkey or egypt tour packages
4083414 as for the russian federation local hotel bookings the general lack of technology and mentality of hoteliers in various regions result close to zero online availability of those hotels plus russian immigration rules to foreigners are making it impossible for tourists from other countries to freely travel or go for last minute travel along russian territories those potential tourists could have pushed russian region hotels with bookable online capability but that not has been the case
4083415 its clear that the share of online bookings will grow but how exactly we will know only by the end of this year when sales figures will be revealed
4083416 from this perspective the support to online travel development is tremendous though the cost of credit card acquiring is still a painful point as its 3 3 5 percent comes in with agencys only five percent mark up for the sold service such a high cost of acquiring forces online travel companies to look for alternative ways for payment settlements but obviously holds back the development of industry in general

4083418 esto no es un tema de inseguridad no se trat ni de un robo ni de un secuestro com n sino de un ajuste de cuentas estamos ante un crimen mafioso muy preocupante donde se vio mucha maldad y sa a en los asesinos
4083419 es posible que las otras dos v ctimas ferr n y bina hayan estado en el lugar donde no ten an que estar y que el objetivo fuera forza pero lo que creemos es que los tres se reunieron para ir a ver a alguien por un negocio en conjunto y que all se los llevaron

4083439 ive come out a couple times and actually played defense and chased him down and made him work to explode and cut
4083440 hes really getting close i cant tell you how excited we are about how far hes come in such a short period of time i have to keep it in perspective but were going to be very smart here and im not going to do anything until the trainers give the green light
4083441 im not a doctor im just telling you where we are right now
4083442 hes made tremendous strides and i would think with carnell anything is possible
4083443 weve got size weve got speed weve got youth weve got a lot of talent and its up to me to get it out of them when its all said and done i hope we have some hard decisions to make
4083444 somebodys got to step up antonio bryant is doing that antonio bryant is the one guy i think from a talent standpoint and obviously now getting some experience in these last three weeks that is picking it up but we need a couple more guys to do that starting sunday i hope
4083445 hes got a lot of talent if you just watch the raw talent you see a guy with size speed and excellent hands hes learning two or three positions right now hes cross training which is really hard but im really impressed with him hes a tremendous worker and he made some plays today again that are exceptional were excited about him
4083446 its hard to imagine that at this point we are at wednesday and hes still not able to move around at full speed id like to see him start and finish a practice before we declare him ready to play
4083447 well its a good start the punt return and kickoff returns are the first play of offense we like to start outside our own 20 or 25 yard line i think we were one of the top teams in football in starting inside our 20 obviously our third down defense our punt return opportunities have to get better we still have a ways to go on our kickoff return we didnt function there as well as id hoped although it was the first preseason game thats got to be an area where we create field position we do have some dynamic returners and guys with pride and hopefully it continues to get better and better special teams coordinator rich bisaccia is one of the best in football in my opinion
4083448 he proved he can run he can catch he can block he can cover kicks hes learned this tremendously difficult offense to learn were really pleased with his abilities that he put on tape he didnt get nervous he showed real poise hes a football player that guy did well for himself
4083449 nothing really has changed here we are in the third week of training camp and youre talking about key football players rb cadillac williams petitgout galloway and garcia we miss those guys but the status hasnt changed pup he doesnt seem close to coming back on the practice field but he is working hard its a credit to him its a hard time for him
4083450 yeah yes there sure is thats why hes not active at this point in time i do know our training staff is working hard and luke is working hard the injury just isnt ready to go yet
4083451 i think hes had a consistent camp as he always does hes a guy that can play inside or outside and hes functional on any phase of special teams hes a team guy and hes a reliable football player
4083452 it is remarkable he got hurt in the last preseason game and hes had some long dark hours during the rehab lonely times but hes in a position now to reap the benefits of all this hard work and we need to see him do that come sunday night
4083453 right now were still on yellow and were still working hard
4083454 theres a little bit of caution but boy hes looking good and were excited and happy for him

4083468 it is remarkable he got hurt in the last preseason game and hes had some long dark hours during the rehab lonely times but hes in a position now to reap the benefits of all this hard work and we need to see him do that come sunday night

4083478 what i do know is that war should only be waged when necessary and the iraq war was not necessary
4083479 we want to make sure that it doesnt come to that

4083495 this mantra of elections is replete with red herrings craftily synthesized to maintain pakistan as a servile client state in order to carry on with the same bold imperial designs on the grand chessboard it is merely the rebottling of the same old wine in a different bottle it will surely be legitimately conducted with no apparent riggings and duly approved by all the impartial international observers to give the artful elections an official international legitimacy it is quite immaterial who wins in these elections the laws and the judiciary of the nation have already been reconstituted under the umbrella of emergency to enable the nation to carry on unfettered in its primary objective of fighting the war on terror as an obedient patsy client state and hence to carry on in its own devilishly crafted suicide

4083497 many people would sooner die than think in fact they do
4083498 we dont have guns we dont have banks we dont have storm troopers and we dont have a powerful media what we have is our convictions our courage and our potential weve done a lot of research and weve done a lot of talking and writing what we have not done is taken the next step toward calculated revolution a revolution always begins with ideas and ideals these power the willing and cause the ranks to swell sometimes often the revolution becomes subverted and when the tables are turned the same people are still sitting there this is simplistic but most of you have a grasp of the minutiae and some sense of history real history

4083500 what is inconceivable in normal times is possible in revolutionary times
4083501 surely the united states dreams about iraq will not come true
4083502 one way of measuring the quality of your freedom is just to take a walk
4083503 this is the right time to see who has peoples interests at heart we are not looking forward to leaders holding peoples lives to ransom people are suffering and we need to move forward for the development of the country
4083504 it is unfortunate that mr tsvangirai is not ready to sign but he should understand that this is the time that people have been waiting for any further delays would not help the suffering being experienced in the country
4083505 people feel that the time is now to resolve the crisis in the country and if mr tsvangirai is representing the interests of the people he should sign immediately
4083506 he is thinking of himself rather than the people we are the ones who are suffering at the end of the day we thought the talks could make things better but the situation is becoming worse and worse
4083507 maybe he is going to sign but i think he is using his delaying tactics again but at the same time he should respect the will of the people some of these leaders are becoming selfish and i think he tsvangirai has a hidden agenda
4083508 i dont think they political leaders will be happy to lead people who are starving considering the current situation this is the time to build the country
4083509 prices are going up on a daily basis and i think all the sides should strive to make efforts to solve the problems
4083510 they should sit down and talk in a bid to make efforts so that tsvangirai should also sign the agreements reached
4083511 we have been facing challenges for over a decade now mainly because of the impasse between the political players in the country we had hoped they would be solved by an agreement between the three parties but it seems as if there is still a long way to go
4083512 ordinary zimbabweans hope and pray that a solution to the countrys challenges will be found through the ongoing dialogue
4083513 first of all i would like to urge the leader of the mdc t morgan tsvangirai to consider his position and go back to the negotiating table so as to alleviate the suffering of the people this country can only be successful if everyone works together
4083514 i would like to commend the president cde mugabe for agreeing to talk with the opposition leaders it shows that there is hope for zimbabwe as the nation has now realised that the best way forward is through dialogue
4083515 our leaders should realise that there is no party that can run this country in a vacuum as it stands because no one has a majority in parliament they definitely need each other in solving the countrys challenges

4083526 one living desert lion is tourism wise worth more than all the livestock in these regions together just last week the same ministry talked about closing the beaches for vehicles to save our heritage for future tourism now that seems to be just lip service

4083528 were just starting the weeks when we start seeing cases

4083530 we have totally reclaimed the villages occupied by rebels but troops are still clearing the areas of land mines left behind by the milf forces
4083531 we understand that gas prices are high but why just us
4083532 we can no longer rely on underground sources because of their non sustainability
4083533 its also a better prospect for namwater to fully own the project since it puts them back in the driving seat as national water supplier which is their mandate this would allow them to continue going into non viable projects such as water supply to the poorer areas
4083534 we are also in consultation with the mining companies the potential recipient of this water with the objective to finalise the necessary agreements
4083535 we will be able to rest the aquifers and allow them to recover some of the main aquifers already being over exploited hence the environmental benefit we will be able to gain experience in desalination technology and this experience can be replicated in other parts of the country
4083536 is that a core promise or is it just a promise

4083538 i dont think its very likely we can get it done and a decision by sept 1
4083539 there is no way to know if that is possible or not when we dont even know when the judge will make a ruling
4083540 if the governor would make a decision to remove members by sept 1 it seems sacs would see that as a positive step
4083541 sacs could think a new board would work together and put us on probation
4083542 i think the board members would have liked to move forward today and gotten this over with

4083557 if i were the computer industry i would be panicked because its not obvious what the solution is going to look like and whether we will get there in time for these new machines

4083559 whoever figures out how to take advantage of multicore first could wreak some serious economic damage on their competition
4083560 the sharp rise in reos combined with slow sales has resulted in a bloated inventory of bank owned properties for sale

4083563 there are several possible grounds ranging from bill of rights issues to procedural ones
4083564 the problem that really concerns me is what they might try next

4083571 transfers of manpower and resources including activation and reassignment of units shall be halted
4083572 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4083573 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4083574 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4083575 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4083576 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4083577 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4083578 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4083579 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4083580 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4083581 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4083582 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4083583 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4083584 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4083585 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4083586 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4083587 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4083588 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4083589 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4083590 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4083591 nous navons pas de registre national et pour lheure les sections locales ne font pas tat de d parts en masse le ph nom ne est marginal
4083592 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4083593 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4083594 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4083595 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4083596 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4083597 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4083598 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4083599 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4083600 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4083601 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4083602 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4083603 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4083604 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4083605 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4083606 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4083607 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4083608 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4083609 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4083610 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4083611 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4083612 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4083613 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4083614 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4083615 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4083616 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4083617 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4083618 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4083619 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4083620 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4083621 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4083622 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4083630 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4083631 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4083632 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

4083639 it would be very difficult to pull this information together
4083640 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4083641 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4083642 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4083643 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4083644 once fashion students obtain their degree or diploma it takes a while for them to filter into the industry and it takes a while for them to discover the reality of the fashion industry

4083647 google nsdq goog includes millions of low quality parked undeveloped web sites generated specifically for the purpose of showing ads sham sites in the google search and content networks despite the fact that said sites do not contain any content nor are the ads displayed because of a search query originating from a google search box
4083648 intentionally concealed and omitted googles practice of placing ads on low quality parked adsense for domains sites or on adsense for errors sites as well as on sites that it knows violates cybersquatting trademark copyright and other intellectual property laws
4083649 for example a user intending to visit the retailer targets legitimate web site might mistype it as www
4083650 at the www infringing site the internet user sees a list of ads provided by google including an ad for the legitimate target site if the user clicks the legitimate target ad the user is taken to the true target web site but target has to pay a ransom in the form of a ppc click fee in order to get their intended internet traffic back from google

4083675 sarita almost single handedly convinced the c community that data race free was not only efficient but any proposed departure would be too complex to formalize reasonably
4083676 largely in response amd and intel recently announced their memory model specifications including changes to be compatible with c and java
4083677 um langfristig konkurrenzf hig zu bleiben m ssen wir die anstrengungen noch verst rken um kosten einzusparen und die produktivit t zu erh hen
4083678 die wolken am bisher recht klaren himmel sind nicht zu bersehen
4083679 wir erwarten keine katastrophe es ist eher eine delle ich gehe weiter davon aus dass sich das gesch ft in den n chsten jahren vergr ern wird
4083680 we live in a world populated with enormous amounts of data from a wide variety of sources such as satellite telemetry medical and agricultural sensors and billions of web pages
4083681 there is a compelling human need to represent analyze query manage understand and respond to such data for knowledge extraction and decision making
4083682 with previous efforts focused on networking or user level applications the gaping need to process and respond to large amounts of data has been inadequately addressed our effort will go deep into the system software stack to explore new and better ways to provide system level support for data intensive computing
4083683 to realize the full potential of cloud computing the technology industry must think about the cloud as a platform for creating new services and experiences this shift will require an entirely new approach to the way we design deploy and manage cloud infrastructure and services
4083684 the hp intel and yahoo cloud research testbed gives us the ability to tap the brightest minds in the industry in academia and government to drive innovation in this area
4083685 creating large scale testbeds is important because they lower barriers to innovation and provide the opportunity to experiment and learn at scale
4083686 with this testbed not only can researchers test applications at internet scale they will also have access to the underlying computing systems to advance our understanding of how systems software and hardware function in a cloud environment
4083687 illinois is thrilled to be a part of this groundbreaking effort
4083688 it will accelerate research for data intensive internet scale computing and drive innovation for future systems it will enable a better understanding of internet characteristics especially emerging online social networks it will also enable development of open source tools for network analysis fast querying and transfer of distributed logs search engines yielding navigation maps semantic web tools and configuration for multimedia environments
4083689 despite netting 65 million in google inc stock when the search giant bought youtube karim 28 lives in a dorm at stanford university where hes working toward a doctorate in computer science with the goal of becoming a professor
4083690 illinois cs alumna anna pattersons last internet search engine was so impressive that industry leader google inc bought the technology in 2004 to upgrade its own system
4083691 performance analysis of real traffic carried with encrypted cover flows
4083692 our paper shows that its possible to take measurements from real or simulated traffic and use them to estimate parameters for an accurate analytic model of tunneling without the measurements or simulations having any notion at all of tunneling
4083693 the nature of our problem allows for an interesting and useful decoupling of models
4083694 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
4083695 from the softwares perspective the packet gets dropped and yet i have full and complete access to this underlying system that i just compromised
4083696 the cae r designation acknowledges the outstanding leadership in information assurance research at illinois we have exceptional strength in this area which is so important to our nation and our society research in computer security information trust and information assurance is a priority for our campus and we make important state of the art contributions that advance its dissemination and practice illinois is the home of the information trust institute iti which coordinates research and educational activities in information trust across campus including both faculty and student based research the nsa designation recognizes this strength
4083697 were trying to push beyond the traditional boundaries of information assurance and computer security research to seek ways to make information technologies a trusted asset of society information assurance work at illinois has really taken off in the last few years the information trust institute has added new dimensions to information assurance research at illinois by examining secure dependable correct safe private and survivable computer systems networks and software the combination of research thrusts undertaken by iti is perhaps unique in its depth and breadth
4083698 the goal of the program is to reduce vulnerability in our national information infrastructure by promoting higher education in information assurance ia and producing a growing number of professionals with ia expertise in various disciplines
4083699 incomplete list of teachers ranked as excellent by their students
4083700 so far alumni have found out about the club entirely through word of mouth we havent advertised or spent any money marketing the club
4083701 we want to make sure that first we are bringing value to the club members
4083702 once we have demonstrated that we create value then we can build a revenue model that supports it its very similar to growing a company here in silicon valley
4083703 we want to create a great club environment with lots of activities but we also want to be a key contact point for the university we want to help connect professors with companies that are looking for their expertise and help companies find research and funding opportunities in line with their goals
4083704 its about a community the freedom to define what this club will be there is an opportunity for everyone to participate
4083705 error detection mechanisms are vital for building highly reliable systems
4083706 however generic detection mechanisms can take millions of processor cycles to detect errors in programs in the intervening time the program can execute with the activated error and perform harmful actions
4083707 to the best of our knowledge this is the first framework that models the effect of arbitrary hardware errors on software independent of the underlying detection mechanism
4083708 in essence cloaker is a malicious and hidden micro os environment that coexists with the existing os on the device
4083709 we hope that our work motivates future computer system designers to carefully evaluate security gaps at the boundary between computer architecture and system software
4083710 defining the application model for occasionally connected rich internet applications in the mobile environment
4083711 the sloan research fellowships support the work of exceptional young researchers early in their academic careers and often at pivotal stages in their work
4083712 my general research goal is to help people manage large amounts of unstructured data like the text information that is embedded in web email news articles blog articles and scientific literature
4083713 there is a huge amount of information available but how do we use it this is a pervasive issue it affects quality of life and productivity
4083714 the team demonstrated that they actually knew how their system worked because they developed a test for it
4083715 its a sign of good design to create unit testing for the functionality you intend
4083716 the question that stuck out was why were these bugs there to begin with
4083717 when we started thinking we realized that current web browsers are fundamentally flawed
4083718 current browsers dont have a mechanism for enforcing security policies nor do they have knowledge of what appropriate policies might be
4083719 if you look at the state of the art the only thing that we were left to do was to build a new browser from the ground up
4083720 the biggest problem with existing browsers whether its ie or firefox is that a browser exploit gives the attack access to everything on the system its even more troublesome on browsers where plug ins are being used a single exploit from a single web page sacrifices the security of the entire system thats unacceptable
4083721 and that essentially what we are doing with our work partitioning the browser into smaller subsystems
4083722 this allows us to provide security in a way that other browsers can not
4083723 there is lots of work going on today regarding how to better use data centers but very little research into how to better manage them
4083724 with critical infrastructure being moved to globally distributed clusters its important that we find better and more efficient ways of monitoring events on these systems the challenge is in scaling being able to scale really well in spite of the wide distribution and large numbers of machines in these kinds of architectures
4083725 qualifying for the acm icpc world finals for the fifth time in six years is a truly impressive feat a feat made even more remarkable by the fact that this years team includes two freshmen
4083726 it confirms what weve always known to be true illinois computer science students are among the best and the brightest in the world
4083727 this well warranted recognition of two of our senior faculty members by the one of the most prestigious professional societies in our field affirms the consistent record of excellence they have exhibited in their research as well as the great respect they command among their peers
4083728 when i came to illinois i felt i had only just begun to touch the problem of qos i really wanted to explore all of the individual puzzles in the end to end qos chain of ip based wired and wireless networks general purpose operating systems application session transport and routing protocols truly looking at how qos works with underlying support structures versus how it can be done without
4083729 weve been able to really understand the set of puzzles underlying and supporting qos for certain set of multimedia applications however new end to end qos challenges are coming up as new applications arise such as large scale tele immersive environments large scale distributed interactive games interactive digital television that need new qos results in terms of considering heterogeneous devices their scale and their integrated usability for diverse group of users over diverse networks
4083730 we are experiencing a boom in multimedia sensory information accessible to everybody such as 2d and 3d camera arrays microphone arrays hdtv 3d displays that can deliver experience never seen and heard of before except in expensive studios
4083731 how do you organize that information so it can be delivered to remote places in some ways its revisiting whats already been done to address qos but on a much larger scale
4083732 the current perception is that security is antithetical to performance
4083733 why does this have to be security must happen for many of these new applications so how can we make security and performance work together
4083734 jennifers j sim work was an astonishing undertaking the scale of the project would have daunted other researchers but it was the kind of work that needed to be done if we were to get to the next level of network simulator
4083735 she and her students have conducted some strong and deep theoretical studies of network design
4083736 this work supplements her practical work you might expect a researcher to excel in on area or another but jennifer was excellent on both fronts
4083737 to on the one hand understand how network components and systems interact coordinate with one another via theoretically grounded measurement modeling and simulation techniques in the cyber physical space and study how they perform under a wide variety of circumstances and on the other hand to design refine new existing network and systems techniques to optimize their interaction subject to environmental effects
4083738 we believe entrepreneurs are looking for people like themselves people who also have taken ideas and made them a reality this second fund allows us to invest in areas for which we have deep insight personal experience and passion for seeing the companies succeed
4083739 our collective experience starting companies and funding innovative start ups positions the founders fund as a unique valuable resource at the early investment stage
4083740 paypal co founder peter thiel and three fellow managing partners paypal co founder and former paypal cfo ken howery paypal co founder and cs alumnus luke nosek and facebook founding president sean parker all of whom personally experienced the highs and lows of starting and running their own companies before joining founders fund say they are trying to bring back a key element of silicon valleys early days veteran entrepreneurs not professional money managers seeding new ventures
4083741 its not very comforting if youre simulating a rocket launch and you cant ensure that your simulation adheres to the laws that govern the physical world
4083742 the theory of discrete exterior calculus is not yet complete
4083743 i will be using specific applications of the theory to explore the gaps in our theoretical understanding and find ways to complete the theory so that it is more stable and accurate id like to put the theory into a unified framework and see how it applies in other areas of science and engineering
4083744 in laying new theoretical foundations anil is endeavoring to create a nice correspondence between continuous and discretized worlds his efforts will be key to making the discretized world as rich mathematically as the continuous mathematical world already is
4083745 my previous work focused mostly on parallel processing and algorithms and less on classical numerical algorithms
4083746 the opportunity now at illinois is to combine those areas and look at the whole problem path thats one of the reasons illinois was so attractive it has so many strengths in the entire parallel computing chain
4083747 bill gropp brings enormous strengths to the department including senior leadership for our scientific computing group and strong collaborative ties to our software architecture and parallel computing groups
4083748 this gives me the opportunity to look at the issues of making numerical mathematics match computer science something that gene has always promoted its also consistent with what pauls work has been about making the math right for the machine
4083749 at nationals i guess i was even more confident when i saw what the competition did
4083750 insofar as theres an average work day driving the rovers it looks like this as fast as possible usually within the first half hour we assess the results of the previous day make sure there are no concerns and work with the science team to make a good guess as to what we should try to achieve that day
4083751 we are pleased to have linda mills lead our information technology sector
4083752 she is an accomplished leader and is broadly experienced in information technology program management operational excellence and customer relationships she has excelled in a wide variety of assignments in our mission systems and it sectors
4083753 its amazing how many hot web properties can trace their ancestries to paypal
4083754 it basically started by hiring all these people in concentric circles
4083755 i hired friends from stanford and max brought in people from the university of illinois
4083756 the accomplishments of mary jane irwin demonstrate the powerful and positive influence that women can have on shaping a brighter future for all of us and in doing so inspire a whole new generation of women
4083757 irwin and anita borg social impact award winner paula goldman are innovators and trailblazers in technology and exemplify the individuals capacity to excel following their own vision while empowering others to define and pursue their personal goals and aspirations
4083758 a sentence is a sequence of words and a protein is a sequence of amino acids
4083759 as a computer scientist i want to know what makes these search processes in nature so fast and so reliable and how we can exploit these principles in our algorithms
4083760 because he has not expressed good judgment in the past and the pilipino community does not support him
4083761 the city adopted it and when you have multiple qualified strong candidates weve typically endorsed them we need to be as diverse a party as possible
4083762 it would be a disappointment to shut him out after all the years he put it on for the community
4083763 supporting the academic community is a top priority at yahoo
4083764 we received an overwhelming number of outstanding applications and the competition was very keen
4083765 most importantly i want to find new ways to help users find hard to find information during web searches so that they wont be frustrated with reformulating queries many times but still without finding what they want
4083766 it could display search options as a conceptual map users could zoom in zoom out or move horizontally depending on the topics that they can see in proximity on the map such a map would allow a user who is unable to formulate an effective query e g someone looking for a particular piece of music but without knowing the name of the song or artist to reach the needed information through navigation
4083767 xuanhui is an outstanding researcher with excellent skills in developing general effective algorithms to solve a family of problems
4083768 his dissertation will open up a highly promising new paradigm for exploratory web search which would enable users to easily find relevant information primarily through navigation this fellowship is indeed a very well deserved honor for him
4083769 the yahoo ph d fellowship is highly competitive only nine recipients have received it so far i am very pleased to have two students receiving this prestigious award
4083770 we are grateful to yahoo for their support of our research and hope to use this opportunity to develop next generation search engine technologies to help people make better use of the web
4083771 human beings can be silly because we move away from things too quickly in this country
4083772 streetcar is definitely going to create a reason for young people to come downtown
4083773 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death
4083774 the argument billionaires bloggers and the battle to remake democratic politics
4083775 are they totally oblivious to the extent to the embarrassment theyre causing
4083776 im so excited to be able to offer a line of outerwear with our logo online fans have been requesting it for a long time and im happy edelsbacher design group made it happen
4083777 the crabwizards online store offers a variety of tee shirts hats and sweatshirts available in multiple colors for both wizards and wizettes are available for purchase captain colburn requires that all crabwizard products offered on his site be screen printed and embroidered in the usa also that all the clothing textiles used are manufactured in the usa and assembled in countries that practice fair trade policies
4083778 dr steve chen is a legendary technologist who brings tremendous insight and experience to iptv corporation
4083779 we are honored to have his counsel as we work to create innovative video commerce technologies for internet protocol television
4083780 internet protocol television is an emerging technology which will bring tremendous opportunities not only in collaborative commerce but also in collaborative healthcare education entertainment science and engineering applications to maximize human creativity and productivity my work during the last 38 years in the high performance computing field will help accelerate this technology into worldwide markets
4083781 given our familys long standing ties to the university and our belief in the incredible strength of the institution we decided not to wait until a member of the next generation travels to champaign urbana something quite likely if history is a guide before making a meaningful contribution to the university
4083782 competition among top tier institutions for exceptional students is fierce and we didnt want the university to lose a sought after student simply because of financial considerations
4083783 our grandparents were critical to our upbringing introducing us to foreign cultures consistently demonstrating respect for family and always emphasizing the importance of hard work and a great education
4083784 our grandparents are no longer with us but continue to have a lasting influence on us
4083785 its pleasant to see something you learn working in real life
4083786 this meter allows us to determine how much power is being used by each part of the house
4083787 every sensor that we put improved the quality for the user in the house
4083788 to design build and operate the most attractive effective and energy efficient solar powered house
4083789 right now researchers on campus on coming up with ideas on what to put inside the house
4083790 there were definitely some positive outcomes a lot of the teams did not take first in any of the rankings
4083791 we did accomplish what we really had set out to do
4083792 among the most generous philanthropists now in all of higher education
4083793 tom set a new standard as others have in the past like arnold and mabel beckman like david grainger in terms of significant giving nothing could be more helpful for us than to have a significant gift of this magnitude
4083794 his thinking is expansive he realizes that the problems one wants to approach such as energy transcend one discipline hes one whos focused on a gift that is transformative just as he himself transformed an industry
4083795 the libraries that are doing well across the country are the libraries that are evolving
4083796 we are recognizing that people are not coming to the library just for books anymore they are they are wanting to get dvds

4083801 lindas diverse business and management accomplishments combined with her knowledge and leadership experience at northrop grumman will be a tremendous asset to our civilian agencies organization
4083802 linda has the talent to effectively oversee the companys pursuits in the non traditional defense market including health it and homeland security initiatives
4083803 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4083804 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4083805 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4083806 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4083807 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4083808 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4083809 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4083810 i thought it was wonderful getting to meet other people who are in the same situation as me
4083811 i feel like people sometimes second guess us because were different that were only here because we have this quota to fill
4083812 the hardest part is proving to people that we are smart enough
4083813 we want to get more funding so we can send more members to the conference
4083814 the conference is focused on women in technology and giving help on various things
4083815 there are a lot of successful women out there who are doing great things in many areas of computer science
4083816 is to focus on applications having impact on challenging physical problems of broad community interest and that could really show sustained petascale performance given the right computer science tools and libraries on the planned hardware concerted effort between the physical and computer scientists is critical for this to happen not all square blocks fit into the same round hole the outcome is solutions to problems that up till now were impossible
4083817 these inaugural projects will bring the development and deployment competencies of ncsa to bear on challenges in diverse disciplines and will forge unique collaborations between illinois faculty and ncsa staff
4083818 its very exciting to be able to foster such innovative work
4083819 to on the one hand understand how network components and systems interact coordinate with one another via theoretically grounded measurement modeling and simulation techniques in the cyber physical space and study how they perform under a wide variety of circumstances and on the other hand to design refine new existing network and systems techniques to optimize their interaction subject to environmental effects
4083820 through the years jennifer has been a great advisor to me and the group i got encouragement honest judgment of the work and patience to observe my research progress and jennifer never let the group worry about the research funding she always led me and pushed me go deeper to understand things from a more fundamental theoretical viewpoint
4083821 jennifer was a vibrant presence in our department both as a researcher and an educator
4083822 she was a dedicated mentor to her students and was civic minded in focusing her research for the public benefit she will be greatly missed by her many colleagues students and friends
4083823 how am i supposed to pay off my debt if you throw me in jail
4083824 a debt collector may not make any false statements in the collection of a debt
4083825 they cannot threaten arrest or imprisonment if the consumer does not pay the debt
4083826 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head at a time that is supposed to be about world unity
4083827 or maybe theyre sending a message to the chinese team because they will be competing against them
4083828 they must be saying the chinese people are really thoughtful because theyre pointing to their minds
4083829 perhaps theyre mimicking someone maybe its supposed to be a funny thing
4083830 theyre making fun of the asian face i dont think its appropriate
4083831 for the people who grow up in foreign counties there might be a problem and it could be very insulting
4083832 its not a big deal to me it doesnt matter to me
4083833 this kind of insult doesnt exist in mainland china its not a problem here
4083834 but if its problem in the u s its reasonable to have an apology for chinese americans
4083835 theyre all very big guys doing something silly and making a fool of themselves theyre trying to connect with the chinese people
4083836 slated eyes are considered very beautiful in china so i think its a compliment not an insult
4083837 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4083838 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4083839 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4083840 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4083841 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4083842 police booked his ticket from ho chi minh city to london and i have already paid for the ticket on his behalf
4083843 if i screw this up dont upload it to youtube
4083844 illustrates what youtube is all about namely that anyone who has a good idea can take that idea and make it happen
4083845 im not saying there isnt a future in pottery but its not what i signed up for
4083846 a highly motivated dedicated and ambitious student at your fine school
4083847 i was following in the footsteps of the illinois innovators
4083848 most ideas dont come in a flash but stew in your brain for a while
4083849 two colleagues from paypal and i talked about a video sharing web site we started working on feb 14 2005 valentines day thats one of those things about being a computer science major valentines day is just another day
4083850 by june we had revamped it to make it more open and more general it worked
4083851 in 18 months youtube had a far greater impact than anyone ever expected including me
4083852 remember the world is waiting on you to create the next big opportunity
4083853 as your last academic requirement i want every last one of you to get up out of your seats and dance badly
4083854 illinois students are truly fortunate to learn from and work alongside professors such as these
4083855 through their research and teaching these faculty members are pioneering the future of science and passing on their knowledge and love of learning to a new generation of scientists
4083856 some of the most genial nicest students you could ever meet
4083857 the problem becomes how do you build a processor knowing that this variation exists
4083858 essentially designers target a performance that is low enough that even the slowest transistors can make it
4083859 the nature of computing is that 100 efficiency is unattainable
4083860 however while we cant assume best case performance and power we can do a much better job that just assume worst case
4083861 but if we are going to have parallel architectures at all ranges of computing then we will need programming models that fit at many ranges of programmer skill as well
4083862 im pleased to see illinois security research so well represented in this years cyber trust grants
4083863 these new projects give a good sense of the wide variety of excellent security work going on at illinois security issues cut across all of computer science and you can really see that in the mix of topics in these grants from operating systems to networking and storage and from theory to applications were working to meet the needs of computer users all across the board
4083864 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4083865 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4083866 recognizing with high accuracy such relations is difficult due to the inherent ambiguity of the english language
4083867 the aim of computational semantics is to identify techniques for semantic representations of natural language text representations that can be used to perform inference
4083868 the inherent ambiguity of natural languages makes it a challenging topic but its mandatory for any advanced natural language understanding system
4083869 are going to bring more insights into various research issues in areas such as artificial intelligence linguistics and cognitive science
4083870 this years winners focused on technologies that will help students and researchers alike collaborate and work more efficiently as a community
4083871 this kind of thinking is exactly what we hoped the competition would inspire among our department
4083872 as research and class projects become increasingly complex clubdev will better enable small team collaboration as a means for solving those problems
4083873 the overall benefit of this system is that it better facilitates the types of activities that are desired but arent easily realized during group development
4083874 our system is grounded in the domain of sketching as it is a common and accepted form of conceptualizing ideas for complex design problems
4083875 working with multiple design ideas in parallel allows for re interpretation of ideas and reflection on action designers are able to generate new ideas from existing ones reframe ideas from new perspectives and develop deeper understanding of the inter relationships between the design problem space and potential solutions
4083876 we are enhancing the collaborative environment of the siebel center by providing a new and in your face way for the department to get feedback about issues from siebel residents or increase interest in topics by providing a polling interface
4083877 were also providing a fun way for siebel residents to interact with each other in the building
4083878 we send patches around wouldnt it be nice if you could simply get another patch from the vendor to fix your hardware
4083879 ever since wanmin has been here at the university she has been a go getter it is a pleasure to work with her and her level of scientific independence is brilliant
4083880 i believe the technology tele immersion would also be particularly useful in supporting tasks involving physical movement where 3d depth information is important for example students learn yoga remotely with an instructor firefighters receive training with virtual buildings experienced doctors observe and advise remote surgeries and so on
4083881 war made easy how presidents and pundits keep spinning us to death

4083883 it soon became clear that the six point deal not only failed to slow the russian advance but it also allowed russia to claim that it could push deeper into georgia as part of so called additional security measures it was granted in the agreement
4083884 by mid morning european officials were warning of the risks of appeasing russian aggression while georgian officials lamented the wests weak leverage
4083885 im talking about the impotence and inability of both europe and the united states to be unified and to exert leverage and to comprehend the level of the threat said the senior georgian official who had sat in on the talks between mr sarkozy and georgias president mikheil saakashvili

4083897 i do not have a role at hp going forward
4083898 im just incredibly bullish about whats happening in the industry and in the valley
4083899 the amazing thing about marc has been watching him grow up in the industry
4083900 with opsware he really settled down and put in the hard yards
4083901 the entire market for what we did completely blew up
4083902 i hit the road and spent a huge amount of time with investors analysts and customers
4083903 i really feel loudcloud and opsware are much greater accomplishments for him personally
4083904 the obstacles were much greater in our sector it was 100 percent bankruptcy
4083905 as a kid this is always the thing i wanted to do
4083906 we are used to doing this type of programming in the classroom but now we can be exposed to the real world
4083907 we sometimes work 12 hours a day 7 days a week
4083908 even without a sponsor we would do it ibud anyway but then feida saw the iventures advertisement on the video wall in the siebel center and we knew it was just for us
4083909 the website should be everything you need before during and after your trip
4083910 its pleasant to see something you learn working in real life
4083911 this program enables researchers to address their most challenging research questions with the assistance of our expert staff and the benefit of our expertise in information technology high performance computing data analysis and other critical areas
4083912 our mission is to advance discovery by empowering our collaborators
4083913 every computer should become a portal to new worlds new experiences new cultural engagement new social and business entrepreneurship new research
4083914 the worldwide web gives us a glimmer of this but imagine if rather than visiting nasas web page and sitting in solitary isolation reading about nasa science you instead were plunged into the thick of a nasa ames research lab in 3d surrounded by avatars of nasa scientists exploring new data from mars imagine if you could interact with them and contribute to their research
4083915 we found five different transcription factors that showed a statistically significant correlation with socially regulated genes
4083916 it appears that genes involved in nervous system development in fruit flies are re used by nature for behavioral functions in adult honey bees
4083917 llvm is designed to allow developers to glue together a variety of languages and frameworks all in the service of building smarter compilers interpreters and just in time jit code generators which are capable of removing unnecessary parts of a program during runtime
4083918 llvm is a persistent representation that is designed for optimization
4083919 memory safety holds the promise of preventing a large class of exploits such as
4083920 the evolution of 4th generation surgery tools will help spread brain surgery to the masses altogether dispensing with neurosurgeons in small hospitals that cannot afford their high pay do you feel that i am pulling your leg i am programming at least programming of a large complex code is a specialized task that requires a specialist a software engineer to the same extent that brain surgery requires a specialist you might claim that many non specialists do write code it is also true that most of us take care of our routine health problems but only a fool would try brain surgery because he was successful in removing a corn from his foot to believe that better languages will soon make software engineers redundant is to believe that artificial general intelligence will progress much faster than most of us expect or to belittle the specialized skills of software engineers
4083921 the idea is to build sound like legos from one sound to whole words
4083922 a lot of the deficiencies among children on the autism spectrum are social
4083923 the theory is that they get anxious in social settings and dont know how to participate so we are looking at ways to use speech visualization tools to teach them conversational give and take
4083924 early career development activities of those teacher scholars who most effectively integrate research and education within the context of the mission of their organization
4083925 creative and effective research and education career development plans that build a firm foundation for a lifetime of integrated contributions to research and education
4083926 exige una actividad permanente de pol tica econ mica para hacer frente a una situaci n de estancamiento de frenazo econ mico
4083927 people have this idea that the worlds are mutually exclusive but theyre not
4083928 our goals are very similar its about breaking down barriers
4083929 its a constant conversation between people thats why its working
4083930 innovation doesnt have to be a product innovation can be the way that im using my body in a virtual space
4083931 the tele immersive environment is a beautiful platform to put everyone on the same page
4083932 recognizes undergraduate students in north american universities who show outstanding research potential in an area of computing research
4083933 lars proposed an algorithm for localizing a robot and then proceeded to demonstrate it on a modified roomba robot
4083934 his approach is shocking because the robot uses only a binary contact sensor to determine where it is at there are hundreds perhaps thousands of papers on robot localization but we are not aware of any that are able to accomplish localization with such absurdly small amounts of sensing
4083935 all you need is a compass and a bump sensor
4083936 real robots break down and stuff goes wrong with them
4083937 so i think ill work on more of the theoretical in the future
4083938 the overlooked avenue was how to optimize the parallel performance of the algorithm given a fixed n and p
4083939 here we were able to come up with innovative ideas that liberate one from the textbook limitation of serialization that only one vertex can be added at a time katyas role in these insights was significant
4083940 it gave me a good estimate on what grad school i would get into
4083941 i plan to keep working with parallel computing possibly combining the web with parallel architectures
4083942 the multi core processor is becoming the standard and i think its very exciting to be part of the research in it
4083943 develop and implement global topological tools to dramatically reduce the amount of sensing complexity needed to solve problems across a variety of department of defense applications involving sensor networks autonomous systems and configurable sensor platforms
4083944 some of the best mathematicians roboticists and computer scientists in the world
4083945 stomp is really about breaking down barriers its about collaboration we have roboticists who love mathematics we have mathematicians who love robotics and its happening here first because people talk to one another the culture of the university of our departments really values sitting down and talking
4083946 other places impose strict hierarchies and project specific goals but the illinois way is to have common space and talk
4083947 but pardon the oxymoron a big part of stomp is minimalism
4083948 instead of making expensive robots that gather tons of useless data we are attempting to make robots that have simple inexpensive sensors but can nevertheless get the job done why because someone understood what information is actually needed
4083949 its not like we get lots of data and mine it to do this
4083950 after a centurys work we have a lot of tools that have yet to cross over into the engineering world this project is all about that technology transfer
4083951 i want to get at fundamental questions of robotics and enjoy collaborations with all the other disciplines that have a real contribution to make to it
4083952 i dont think we could have found a more ideal person to be the first paul and cynthia saylor professor
4083953 not only has he played a major role in advancing high performance parallel computing but he has done so with particular emphasis on its role in scientific computing his work nicely complements the work that gene golub was well known for as well as that of paul saylor
4083954 before coming to illinois my previous work focused mostly on parallel processing and algorithms and less on classical numerical algorithms
4083955 the opportunity now at illinois is to combine those areas and look at the whole problem path this professorship gives me the opportunity to look at the issues of making numerical mathematics match computer science something that gene has always promoted its also consistent with what pauls work has been about making the math right for the machine

4083957 you are essentially taking a class in real life company building on the nickel of a venture capitalist its a pretty unbeatable deal
4083958 what sort of world knowledge we need the machines to understand in order to get them to respond more intelligently
4083959 i cant even imagine what the world would be like were so far off
4083960 he is one of the star students coming out of this university this year clearly one of the top phd candidates in ai machine learning this year in the us
4083961 these 2007 acm fellows are the inventors of technology that impacts our society in profound and tangible ways every day
4083962 they have pushed the boundaries of their respective computing disciplines to create remarkable achievements that have the potential to make our world more accessible more secure and more advanced
4083963 davids many research accomplishments have been intellectually deep and technologically influential and it is entirely fitting that he has been selected to join the elite group of acm fellows
4083964 we are delighted that david continues to bring such distinction to himself and to the department
4083965 there have been many significant advances but so far the problem of translation from conventional languages to parallel systems has not been satisfactorily solved
4083966 how do we make the task of the compiler easier while not making life difficult for the programmer
4083967 many are skeptical this is certainly a difficult problem but it can be solved efficient machine independent programming is possible
4083968 my favorite part is making the mouse bounce against the wall and go crazy
4083969 the plays the thing here it is our job to make lots of little ahas happen during the play not to disrupt the play we are not trying to teach specific math at this point but how to be real mathematicians the children have to play with math to do this
4083970 i would like computers to be fun for my daughter and squeak seems like a great way to do that its more visually appealing and immediately you can see that theres more depth to the program
4083971 squeak challenges our kids to use technology to explore to create to think and to learn
4083972 it helps with so many different areas not just math and science it can really get kids interested in learning
4083973 we hope that itll bring increased attention to our work and help inspire new directions in critical infrastructure protection research
4083974 the subject of solar power and renewable energy has always been one of interest to me and i believe that renewable energy and energy efficiency is very critical right now
4083975 we found that unless passenger prescreening can be done well the prohibitive costs of using such technologies may not be warranted in essence our analysis shows that the accuracy of the prescreening system in assessing passenger risk is more critical for reducing the number of successful attacks than the effectiveness of the checked baggage screening devices at detecting threats when few passengers are classified as higher risk
4083976 the transportation security administration believes selective screening of aviation passengers may result in better security at airports in the united states under selective screening passengers are prescreened using passenger information to determine the degree of risk that each passenger poses this degree of risk is then used to determine the amount of security resources appropriate for that passenger how to determine this degree of risk and the information that should be used are controversial topics as evidenced by the large amounts of discussion concerning capps and secure flight
4083977 multi and many core computing is becoming pervasive client focused mass market applications are now driving parallel programming
4083978 we face a new challenge one that places emphasis on productivity over high performance and one that addresses the needs of the broad community of application developers in such an environment parallel programming must be accessible to all programmers
4083979 we believe that most parallel programmers should be able to use simple intuitive ways of expressing parallelism
4083980 future microprocessors will contain hundreds and perhaps thousands of cores while parallel languages must become simpler hardware is becoming more complex we will be researching ways to bridge this enlarging gap to enable client focused applications of the future
4083981 we have a new opportunity and a new challenge for parallel computing today
4083982 the market is larger so there is an opportunity to provide different programming solutions for different applications the challenge is that these solutions must be supported by one flexible hardware architecture and a few software system architectures our multi disciplinary approach will be critical to provide this diversity for programmers and convergence for the system
4083983 illinois is to parallel computing as spring rain and soil are to corn just as corn wont grow without essential nutrients the next generation of processors will not reach full performance without the attention of illinois faculty
4083984 we are proud to partner with intel and microsoft to advance a common agenda of enabling the latest in processor technology to take advantage of programming ideas that unleash the potential for dramatically enhanced performance and interaction
4083985 we are excited about working with the university of illinois because its stellar faculty and students are global leaders in creating breakthroughs in parallel software and architecture
4083986 their excellence builds on a long tradition of excellence in parallelism which goes back over many decades
4083987 we are pleased to be working with the university of illinois to solve one of the most complex issues facing the technology industry today
4083988 by having the expertise of both industry and academia at our new research center we are confident we will make great strides in this area and ultimately bring the benefits of parallel computing to consumers
4083989 to connect and access disks modern storage systems also contain many other components including shelf enclosures cables and host adapters and complex software protocol stacks failures in these components can lead to downtime and or data loss of the storage system
4083990 hence in complex storage systems component failures are very common and critical to storage system reliability
4083991 storage system designers should also think about using smaller shelves with fewer disks per shelf but with more shelves in the system
4083992 we were inspired by youtube paypal and google to some degree
4083993 we want to provide a program to engage student entrepreneurs in start ups
4083994 we will help them with the paperwork in forming and setting up a company
4083995 and we will fund up to 25 000 per team which we think is just enough resources to prototype an idea
4083996 iventures10 is not focused on writing a fictional business plan
4083997 it will instead focus on building a real product our aim is that by the end of the 10 week program the teams will be able to demo their product to potential investors and customers
4083998 they felt like their safety was reduced by additional levels of surveillance
4083999 in conventional video chat situations we stand face to face speaking or gesturing as we would in a mirror as children with my version of this encounter the mirror reveals another space as continuous with yours but reveals only the backs of your companions
4084000 when security alerts surveillance cameras and reality tv are blurring the boundaries between voluntary and involuntary acting for the camera
4084001 in the earliest days of video art in the artists engaged the question of when surveillance becomes performance and vice versa the issue remains central to the work of many video artists today
4084002 find out just which are the best in offering students a high tech environment to prepare for the real world
4084003 there must be something special in the water in urbana illinois
4084004 david kunzman a phd student along with gengbin zheng a postdoctoral researcher and others are working to adapt and develop charm for the cell processor we expect to be able to provide a highly productive method for programming the superfast yet challenging chip with marc snirs expertise in parallel programming and novel ideas for parallel programming abstractions we have the potential to create with thousands of these chips together an ultra powerful computer with low power consumption
4084005 a huge tour de force of technology introspection about real and virtual being and indeed about the nature of existence
4084006 well need to train a lot more before the world finals
4084007 the three of us on the team would get together and work on problems for 5 hours on a sunday afternoon so we could get used to working as a group
4084008 its all about typing fast and coding you need both
4084009 we are such a good computing school that we attract the best students
4084010 also practice is essential even using common puzzle books helps just so you are engaged in using your mind to solve problems
4084011 illinois state university showed us this year that more intensive practice really helps a team improve
4084012 we could do with a specialized course in advanced problem solving where students have to come up with timed solutions to problems it really sharpens your skills to have to repeatedly come up with answers
4084013 i think were just hoping to do as well as we can
4084014 there are some real powerhouse teams we want to put on a strong showing
4084015 phoenix detecting and recovering from permanent processor design bugs with programmable hardware
4084016 illinois computer science has a long tradition of excellence in computer architecture
4084017 the fact that so many of our alumni and current students are making significant contributions in this field is extremely gratifying we are pleased and proud that they are continuing the highly influential role that illinois has long played in computer architecture
4084018 an extension of yahoo its going to be a yahoo office with all kinds of activities that range across all the yahoo products
4084019 an affirmation that illinois is one of the hotbeds for informatics in the world
4084020 yahoo will have a strong attracting effect theyre going to attract researchers at the university students and i think theyre going to attract companies and other interested parties outside champaign urbana to come see what theyre doing well all benefit
4084021 some of the top schools and some of the largest schools in the country
4084022 this is a core center one that will attract talent from the midwest to the midwest
4084023 were working closely with the university to establish an internship program working on specific products and technologies
4084024 seeking to facilitate group interaction is not new but its becoming incredibly urgent as people are collaborating more often and on increasingly complex problems
4084025 we now have access to lots of pixels and wireless networks how can we enable people to leverage these resources to better address the problems theyre trying to solve
4084026 you observe a common example of this when one person within a group connects their computer to a projected display as it creates an imbalance among them everyone might want to contribute but only one person has the capability if that person doesnt like someones input they can just choose not to act this typically causes others to discontinue their participation and hurts the overall collaborative effort
4084027 how can a user move a window from one display to another when the user is not physically close to either display
4084028 what happens when one user moves or closes a window that was being used by someone else interaction techniques are necessary for minimizing these types of social conflicts
4084029 consider a traditional desktop window manager part of our work will investigate how to extend this basic concept to support multiple displays and multiple users
4084030 at a systems level we already know how to do these kinds of things the bottleneck has been to create the right application interfaces permission structures and social controls to allow the group to work efficiently and effectively together
4084031 obviously i was pleased but not necessarily surprised to hear the statistics
4084032 i think its partially due to our traditional level of success
4084033 everyone i know who has gone to get a job has made more money than anyone else
4084034 analytical thinking and problem solving combined with good communication skills
4084035 by all means learn the technical but dont expect that to suffice
4084036 rasterization is limited in the kinds of visual effects it can produce and has to be extensively customized just to be able to approximate the appearance of complicated reflective and translucent objects that ray tracing handles nicely
4084037 software like photoshop provides methods for processing photographs but by adding ray tracing users will have the ability to create photorealistic images of things they didnt actually photograph
4084038 in general there are many things that a program could do but programs are not very creative they tend to do the same set of things over and over these speculative optimizations enable us to optimize the code for what programs do ignoring what they could do
4084039 essentially this approach means that people can apply techniques that they are already proposing for transactional memory to get the added benefit of speculative optimization
4084040 its a very interesting approach because it greatly simplifies the implementation of speculative optimizations facilitating their widespread adoption
4084041 currently most compilers perform few speculative optimizations because of the validation effort required to make sure they are correct this approach could completely change that longer term the hardware support allows us to push the envelope on how aggressive speculative optimizations can be
4084042 the weather station and sensors for inside measure the humidity and air flow and are intended to help the resident make decisions on whether to use heating or air conditioning or to open doors
4084043 one of our top priorities in this competition is to inform the user it has been proven throughout time that until the user actually visualizes and comprehends the amount of energy water or any other element they are wasting they will not take any action to change
4084044 our system can suggest in a comprehensive manner to the user ways to reduce energy water or any other elements being consumed inside the house
4084045 cs students have a great role to play because any energy savings has to be managed by controlling the systems that control the house at some point this has to be dynamic and when that happens the computers and systems can work out what is the most efficient way to do things
4084046 this project is a great idea because it is teaching undergraduates how to build a trade off between being comfortable and protecting the environment
4084047 the subject of solar power and renewable energy has always been one of interest to me and i believe that renewable energy and energy efficiency is very critical right now
4084048 i want to be able to work on a project where i really have a lot of control and where i can program some of my own ideas into whatever im working on
4084049 the nvidia fellowship award program is designed to stimulate and support excellence in graphics and computing research in universities worldwide
4084050 we believe this years recipients represent the best and most talented graduate students in the world
4084051 jared is a brilliant graphics researcher capable of understanding some of the most daunting theories in computer graphics so well that he can reduce them to their essence and implement them within the constraints of efficient gpu acceleration
4084052 hes already onto a major new advance in global illumination and with the support of this fellowship he will be able to focus more of his energy on its gpu acceleration
4084053 the goal of the microsoft new faculty fellowship is to promote the use of computing in all kinds of fields
4084054 my work reveals that there are strong structures underlying the constraints in real world problems and that by exploiting such structures many previously intractable problems can in fact be solved efficiently the goal is that by reducing the computational complexity of nonlinear optimization we will develop fast and robust decision making tools and significantly extend the ways that computing can be used in medical scientific and engineering applications i am particularly thrilled about the prospect of accelerating our research in radiotherapy optimization which can improve the treatment quality for many forms of cancers
4084055 although it wasnt long ago that jawed himself was receiving his degree he already has made a huge impact on people around the world
4084056 his concept for what became youtube has changed the very nature of how video files are shared we are proud hes serving as our commencement speaker and we know hell inspire this years graduating class to follow his example and become the leaders of their generation
4084057 we believe the next generation of ground breaking technology will come from a strong alliance between corporations like yahoo and the worlds top universities
4084058 thats why we created the yahoo ph d student fellowship program it fosters collaboration between our world class researchers and ph d students working on cutting edge research
4084059 search engines help people find information but i want to help them get knowledge
4084060 information is usually associated with a context dates and times or people and places my research looks at how to mine the knowledge present in text within its context so we can discover things like how topics are distributed over time or geography
4084061 this fellowship is a very well deserved honor for qiaozhu
4084062 the yahoo award is to honor big thinking phd students i think big thinking is precisely the right phrase to describe qiaozhu he is visionary ambitious and talented
4084063 each partner will bring their own networks and expertise to bear in helping the companies that they choose to fund and take a proactive role in helping small companies get a strong start said keith rabois
4084064 phoenix detecting and recovering from permanent processor design bugs with programmable hardware
4084065 the breadth and depth of the contributions these computing scientists and professionals have made to our world and the way we live are remarkable
4084066 their work reflects outstanding displays of creativity and commitment to the computing community which continues to drive innovation in industries and enterprises across the globe these individuals deserve our acclaim for providing dedicated leadership solving complex problems and pursuing productive careers in information technology that have advanced the quality of life for people everywhere
4084067 all of my educational and outreach activities are designed around the general goal of providing a solid theoretical basis to our students in networking and communications
4084068 hardware reliability will be a major obstacle to reaping the benefits of increased integration projected by moores law
4084069 we are developing a low cost flexible and application customizable system framework that can detect diagnose recover from and repair or reconfigure around a variety of hardware and software faults
4084070 parameter variation is a major obstacle to the continued scaling of integrated circuit technology
4084071 if parameter variation is not addressed the result will be processor chips that run at lower frequencies and are much less power efficient than they would be capable of
4084072 in this college community entrepreneurship is a town and gown affair
4084073 we are living in exciting times when digital video and audio are becoming available via different platforms in multiple size and shapes
4084074 however it is not yet ubiquitous and pervasive i plan to energize the multimedia community to make the multimedia technologies pervasive across many boundaries
4084075 we the sigmm community need to be in the front of this development
4084076 g a m e s opens a lot of doors for you like it teaches you and it prepares you for the rest of your life
4084077 i think its important to have girl role models who are in these fields so if its something they want to do then they can see someone whos in it already that they can aspire to be
4084078 were trying to get rid of the stereotype that you have to be nerdy to do math science or engineering or that you have to be on your computer all the time
4084079 its one of those things where girls arent really pushed into these fields and its kind of not the cool thing to be doing while youre in junior high at this age liking these subjects
4084080 they all of a sudden look around and say hey im not a nerd
4084081 if we have more girls it seems like we can make the boys understand that we are capable of being in this major because right now there arent many so a lot of them think that were not smart enough
4084082 women belong in computer science and not every woman has to do it but at least to know that they have that opportunity is very valuable i think
4084083 this is just one way that we get them involved to see there are other career options besides just what they see

4084087 computer science a field which encourages fun creative problem solving for great pay ought to attract many it should attract those who want to improve web interfaces for the blind speed up parallel performance for biological simulations perform search on video content or create digital narrative media it should attract those who want to make social impact as others have made world wide with the cellular phone google and youtube it should attract and retain all kinds it should but it does not instead the faces of todays computer science community do not reflect those of the larger global community the decrease in enrollment and lack of diversity in computer science suggests that the students who do enroll in computer science need to be encouraged to stay
4084088 a case study of retention practices at the university of illinois at urbana champaign
4084089 he knew about oscilloscopes and soldering guns as well as neural networks
4084090 sylvian rays long and distinguished career spanned almost the entire digital computer era from his pioneering work on the hardware design of the early illiac machines to his most recent research on neural networks which continued beyond his retirement sylvian was a dynamic presence in our department who will be missed by his many friends and colleagues
4084091 he was always supportive of our efforts and our efforts to tackle new issues that were challenging he knew so much from so many different areas from the rudiments of signal processing to more cognitive and social aspects of artificial intelligence
4084092 his wisdom and kindness will remain an inspiration to me he has shaped my own interests given me a broad curiosity and taught me and many others to do research
4084093 engineering model of a partial switching effect in ferrite cores
4084094 not much work has been done thinking about how best to organize current disaster recovery activity
4084095 groups of firefighters cops and medics go in and each has their own communications system there is no coordination between them
4084096 people get spread out you cant find who you need to find
4084097 you need to be sure that the people and resources you require arrive as quickly as possible
4084098 were learning that problems can be more complex than we thought and more complex than we can think
4084099 you need to hand over control to individuals working in ways you cant predict when you look for models of systems that are able to do that and function effectively most come from the natural world
4084100 bees and ants are able to self organize very effectively and accomplish global outcomes even though there are only local networks among them
4084101 there are organisms that have been around a heck of a lot longer than us and have evolved natural forms of communication and social organization
4084102 jonathans been talking about going to the olympics since he started when he was 4
4084103 its crazy i mean seeing someone you have known for 18 years now in the olympics an olympic medalist
4084104 youll see me i cant watch i close my eyes and pray the whole time
4084105 regardless of his outcome were so proud of him were proud because hes gotten this far
4084106 at the close of office hours on july 8 looking
4084107 you have to be candid remember you are under oath i made no such request the decision you brought had the earmarks of a final panel decision that is why i signed it bears your signature as the ponente i am sorry to say this
4084108 efficiency can be mistaken as haste confidentiality of case can be misinterpreted as interest
4084109 i am being ridiculed for being careful confidentiality is a virtue that should not be confused with interest give me a fighting chance to save my reputation
4084110 i thought you are a paragon of efficiency why did you forget
4084111 if the purpose is just to read it why did she sign it
4084112 that is another lie you have to be candid and honest
4084113 it is not true that there was no air force chopper that arrived the chopper was available but the weather condition did not allow the chopper to evacuate the wounded
4084114 the security situation has improved but it will probably take a bit of time before people feel secure enough to return home en masse
4084115 as we strive to increase the quality of our teaching it is gratifying to see the efforts of our best teachers recognized
4084116 i believe that actually seeing other women young woman create games specifically for girls is very inspirational sonya harris the outreach coordinator for the department of computer science says
4084117 many of them are already interested in cs but are misled to believe that it is difficult and boring when they play the games designed by college woman they become inspired to want to learn how to do the same thing
4084118 in the past many of our technical ambassadors competition projects were websites and a few databases this year a few tac teams created games i truly believe they were inspired by the g4g competition
4084119 what would we do if security wasnt in the way
4084120 for new applications and the platforms to support them we have both an opportunity and a responsibility to design for security and privacy from the start
4084121 there are applications that will save money and lives while providing valuable new services if security can be assured
4084122 they think they are spending just a few moments but really they have gone on a chain of diversion that lasts much longer than they are aware
4084123 shamsis research has produced compelling evidence that deferring notifications until breakpoints are reached during a task can result in meaningful reductions in disruption and that these points occur often enough that the timeliness of notifications is not sacrificed
4084124 her research has been radically multi disciplinary regularly spanning the fields of cognitive science computer science and artificial intelligence her unusual ability to grasp and apply theoretical concepts from these various disciplines has allowed her to frame the problem of interruption from new perspectives and generate new solutions
4084125 many of her students have been international students who have gone back to their home countries where their stories of friendly and helpful mentoring from professor belford have been a source of good will both for this campus and for the united states
4084126 she has spent much time improving courses and curriculum for students she has devoted much time as to how the university can improve itself as a human organization especially through her work in the senate throughout her career she has distinguished herself as a computer scientist a teacher a mentor of students a friend and a colleague
4084127 despite the fact that i was thousands of miles away from urbana champaign professor belford consistently mentored me she always remained available i valued both her professional advice on doing my phd and wise feedback regarding my concerns on the impact of doctoral work on my personal and family life writing this letter of support is only a small token of appreciation for the tremendously valuable source of guidance
4084128 during my difficult moments untiring help and advice of dr belford kept me on the right track besides her excellent supervision her timeless patience and positive nature also left a deep impression on me even after graduation she was always available whenever i needed held her help
4084129 her personal commitment and dedication was clearly evident in both her teaching and her research through my experience as a teaching assistant i know professor belfords contributions enriched the educational experiences of countless students
4084130 with this competition chictech offers an opportunity and an incentive for girls to realize the satisfaction of applying technology to address community problems
4084131 it shows that solving such problems requires creativity and strong interpersonal skills
4084132 girls especially at the younger ages are not as involved or as interested in computer science and unless their families are technologically oriented they really have no exposure beyond the basic wordprocessing uses
4084133 there is a need to even the field and make products geared as much towards women as men we want the participants to realize the opportunities available to them and the knowledge that they can gain
4084134 the tac retreat is becoming more and more popular girls in my opinion are starting to see how computer science fits into their everyday lives girls are already working on their projects for next year
4084135 we want to help students tap into the massive computing power of these processors to allow them to do work that was too computationally expensive to do before
4084136 we also want to help them design future massively parallel processors and programming tools
4084137 its a different way of thinking to in your mind lay out a problem into thousands of pieces rather than laying out a problem simply as a recipe sequence of a single path one of the tools we use in the class is nvidias new cuda c programming environment that gives students practical experience in developing applications that use 128 parallel processors and thousands of computing threads in the gpu
4084138 for example a high resolution mri 3d image that used to take 10 hours to reconstruct now can take only about six minutes
4084139 this makes it cost effective to use mri for real time diagnosis we want to make sure that our students are the ones that take advantage of these opportunities to revolutionize their own fields with these new capabilities
4084140 traditionally computer science and computer engineering education has not really addressed parallel processing as an important part of programming its a graduate course and its an elective
4084141 as we move forward with multi core processors and highly parallel gpus everybody will need to know how to program massively parallel processors because thats all there will be there wont be any single core processors any more
4084142 in a large number of disciplines scientific engineering social sciences and the humanities not to mention national defense a large share of the budget and a considerable intellectual effort are invested around the realization that understanding such complex systems requires data and more and more unstructured data
4084143 our center could have a huge impact on one of the key challenges facing computer science and the computing industry today how to deal with the huge amount of unstructured data how to locate organize access and analyze unstructured data
4084144 this program is really going to allow me to find out what i want to do and contribute to this area of study
4084145 the university of illinois is on top in computer science and this program will give you an edge when you go back to work on your own thesis
4084146 i really wanted to get to know the other faculty involved with research here and be able to make connections with them
4084147 if i type in robot can it know i mean toy robots can it know to instead return information about robots in manufacturing when someone from the manufacturing industry types in robot
4084148 they are able to immediately come up with energetic applications of the principles were discussing
4084149 we want to take his thumb and learn it learn how it thinks
4084150 for instance we know that movies with keanu reeves thriller and devil equal a good movie
4084151 but hugh grant renee zellweger and romantic comedy equal a bad movie
4084152 or in classifying web pages to know what topic the page is about
4084153 or to summarize a paragraph or classify product reviews or to know whether or not a news article contains information about a topic
4084154 what this new technology allows us to do is to study the details of genes in a systematic high throughput manner
4084155 all that i study could be done by card carrying biologists with microscopes and traditional techniques but they might arrive at one development in twenty years with a computer we can make predictions a thousand times faster than that
4084156 sometimes these sequences are like loosely organized sentences in that case i look for bunches of words
4084157 if we can understand these patterns and how sequences evolve we can understand how evolution as a phenomenon works
4084158 computers are very adept at making pattern discoveries and correlations between different data
4084159 my job is to help them do this effectively and efficiently this is a completely new era in science and computers are leading the way
4084160 being able to map real time data happening in the physical world onto a computer will have tremendous societal impact observing weather patterns calculating soil erosion sensing pollution the applications seem endless
4084161 the ability to collect massive amounts of real time data and apply it to the world we live in by visualizing it on a live map is very exciting any one of the projects has the potential to change the way people live commute to work or build a structure as well as empower scientists in their increasingly important environmental research
4084162 we developed the sensormap portal as a step toward the vision of creating a world wide sensor web
4084163 sensormap enables data owners to easily publish and share sensor data and also lets users query and browse live data on a geographic interface such as virtual earth
4084164 what if i could create an avatar of myself that recreates in a virtual world what im doing in the physical world so that my family could access it when im away on a business trip and keep up with what im doing
4084165 this scenario is possible through mobile sensors and sensormap technology
4084166 its essentially enabling us to share physical world experiences the way we share pages on the web
4084167 the potential is endless from bringing the outdoors to a school childs biology lab to bringing people closer together
4084168 just like the web that let millions of us publish and share news documents images here at microsoft we think making live data from sensors accessible can dramatically change the way people live and work today
4084169 with this technology i will know what the trail condition is like before i head out on a run i will know the weather the temperature and other microscopic conditions this is just one small example of how knowing location specific environmental conditions will be useful in our daily lives
4084170 the point is not to have yourself and your friends and their friends just leaving comments for the fun of it
4084171 its about sharing your opinion online there are probably just a couple of people on the social networks who you go to for advice they have strong opinions know whats good and hot and love to tell others about it those are the people that should be on yelp
4084172 the well written and insightful reviews to the actual human beings who wrote them what we call real people real reviews
4084173 there are lots of people out there with the same idea being flexible and having the right people around you having smart people around you and getting things done quickly are key
4084174 it was jeremys idea to create a site motivated by your friends help
4084175 it bugged me that i couldnt find something things like that had been floating in my head but the actual idea came out of the conversation
4084176 at the time the internet was just starting to pick up speed
4084177 and it sounded like there was a lot of cool stuff going on at illinois
4084178 the company started with just six people by the time i left there were hundreds of employees because we had sold the company to e bay
4084179 the most fun and interesting time is when the company is a small size or medium size like a hundred people the bigger the more bureaucratic it is and its harder to try out ideas
4084180 de que no ten an que volver por la empresa
4084181 por la falta de tacto con que se ha hecho
4084182 so i take it youre not coming in today after all
4084183 im walking down the street now ill be there in a bit alright
4084184 you have got one disgraceful attitude boy im your boss show some respect
4084185 oh for fucks sake im a little bit late youre here so what does it matter
4084186 thats exactly what im talking about darren what gives you the right to swear at me like that i havent sworn at you i dont think ive ever sworn at you if were going to work together were going to have to clear the air between us and find some way to get on but things are going to have to change and i wont have you talking to me like that
4084187 ill tell you what eh the stress of this is getting me down its going to make me ill have i still got my holidays due
4084188 right im taking my holidays as of now and im going to use the time to look for another job
4084189 our objective is to discuss amp entertain there is a never ending list of topics to cover and we know there are no taboo conversations in an on line environment adding the video component to our new website allows us to tap every listening viewing option our audience is into
4084190 over in one area we hope to file for a new boat ramp down the stream here a little bit more and then wed have picnic areas and then we hope to have a concrete structure on the river where you can do concerts and so forth
4084191 phelps swimsuit is the true stud of the day a truly amazing engineering feat super fast in the pool and when rolled down stays up high enough by only like a millimeter to not cause an international incident
4084192 you could see the top of his michigan tattoo on his left hip you can totally see it peeking out
4084193 when you hike it up you look like kind of a goomer dork
4084194 phelps swimsuit is the true stud of the day a truly amazing engineering feat super fast in the pool and when rolled down stays up high enough by only like a millimeter to not cause an international incident
4084195 you could see the top of his michigan tattoo on his left hip you can totally see it peeking out
4084196 when you hike it up you look like kind of a goomer dork
4084197 on day 32 colbert democrats receive 8 247 more than the control
4084198 to give a sense of scale the average monthly amount received by all candidates at all points in time in the data is 21 107 so we are talking about a bump of roughly two fifths over the normal rate of receipts
4084199 we need fresh new leadership in washington d c a proven leader like mike huckabee he wasnt too well known on the campaign stump until he got his biggest break the stephen colbert bump
4084200 thats a 300 percent increase after a two and a half minute interview if he keeps up that pace between now and the election hell be the first candidate ever to get elected with 88 128 000 percent of the vote
4084201 ci siamo risvegliati finalmente litalia non quella vista contro gli stati uniti speriamo non sia troppo tardi
4084202 contro la germania sar una sfida ben diversa ma abbiamo fiducia e venderemo cara la pelle anche contro la serbia
4084203 el eder tiene rivales a vencer m s objetivos y son pocos y yo para estar entre los diez primeros tengo que ganarle a m s de diez
4084204 yo espero estar entre este tiempo y un m ximo de 1 22 30
4084205 estoy feliz con el debut en unos juegos ol mpicos y listo para aprovechar mi gran oportunidad de lograr la medalla de oro
4084206 estoy muy satisfecho con mi triunfo y con las posibilidades que tengo de conseguir medalla ol mpica
4084207 he llegado en una gran forma a la competici n y espero ir a m s
4084208 no he perdido la pelea creo que fui superior a mi rival pero los jueces no vieron muchos de los golpes que le conect y que no contaron
4084209 no hay excusas descuid la guardia y me alcanz con un golpe decisivo
4084210 no tuve la oportunidad de demostrar que podr a haber luchado por medalla en mi debut ol mpico
4084211 en estos momentos contamos con un plantel muy parecido al de la temporada anterior con s lo tres incorporaciones hemos fichado tres jugadores como llorente ibagaza y edmilson que considero tres grandes refuerzos que nos pueden aportar muchas cosas
4084212 a medida que se acerca el inicio del campeonato es bueno
4084213 jugar con el sevilla o c diz y bilbao son buenas mediciones y aunque sabemos que son amistosos siempre es un trofeo que motiva y gusta ganar y por ello va a ser muy complicado
4084214 por lo que hemos podido seguir trabajando a un buen ritmo y a buen nivel
4084215 hacer dos equipos diferentes y dar opciones para que todo el mundo tenga minutos y pueda seguir trabajando de cara al inicio de la campa a
4084216 si el jugador no se encuentra seguro es una tonter a arriesgarlo hay m s partidos amistosos y si no se ve con seguridad para jugar este jugar los siguientes
4084217 veo al grupo trabajando con mucha seriedad con mucha ambici n y con muchas ganas de hacer las cosas bien eso me da motivaci n y ganas por luchar y hacer las cosas como en la campa a anterior
4084218 michel daerden tiene un verdadero problema con el alcohol eso es del dominio p blico
4084219 pero nos mantenemos igual estamos contentas y todo pero seguimos siendo paola y tatiana no hemos cambiado
4084220 todav a no se terminan estos juegos para m ni para tatiana estamos ya tengo una medalla ol mpica que era el sue o de mi vida y es lo que valoro lo que vale la pena
4084221 me queda una prueba m s hay que tener responsabilidad para llegar a una prueba que es muy dif cil pero en la que tambi n podemos dar la sorpresa
4084222 ya se sabe lo que pasa con los boxeadores que somos de pa ses peque os no salimos favorecidos
4084223 estoy convencido que fue superior que gan la pelea pero los jueces no lo vieron as
4084224 ahora ya s lo queda aprender de la experiencia haber vivido unos juegos ol mpicos es algo hermoso y seguir trabajando de cara al futuro
4084225 hay estuvo la diferencia aunque al final de la misma pens que pod a ganar por golpes tirados no fue as y se nos fue una victoria que merec amos
4084226 tenemos que seguir trabajando y aprendiendo de este tipo de competiciones
4084227 siempre se puede hacer m s pero debemos ser conscientes que estamos aprendiendo y trabajando de cara al futuro y como siempre he dicho aqu vienen los mejores y el hecho de llegar ya es un triunfo
4084228 no tengo nada que decir simplemente me caz con un golpe duro al descuidar mi defensa y se acab
4084229 la experiencia de unos juegos ol mpicos siempre es importante pero la verdad que estoy un poco desilusionado por la forma como he quedado eliminado
4084230 no pienso nada de cara al futuro s lo descansar y luego ver que es lo que hago
4084231 no estuvimos demasiado acertados en ataque fallamos un poco en nuestros remates y eso ante una selecci n tan potente como la de rusia se acaba pagando con la derrota
4084232 quedan m s partidos por delante y tenemos que seguir trabajando cuando juegan dos potencias como brasil y rusia cualquier resultado es posible no jugamos un mal partido pero ellos lo hicieron mejor que nosotros y nos vencieron con justicia
4084233 estamos en la primera fase y se puede recuperar una derrota sin demasiados problemas la cuesti n es no perder m s partidos y tener un buen d a en los cruces de cuartos de final los rivales tambi n juegan y nosotros no somos infalibles
4084234 no creo que esta derrota nos afecte en la moral al contrario debe servirnos como est mulo para seguir trabajando con m s ganas y m s fuerza ya sab amos que esto pod a pasar y estamos preparados para seguir
4084235 fue un ltimo intento de dar la vuelta al partido una especie de as en la manga y tambi n una prueba para ver c mo estaba de la lesi n que tiene en el hombro derecho no pudimos ganar el partido pero al menos giba no se resinti aunque todav a tiene que mejorar de la lesi n
4084236 la ciudad no tendr que parar para albergar los juegos
4084237 no se registr ning n problema que perjudicase su realizaci n
4084238 hemos estado trabajando durante esta pretemporada con buenas actuaciones como el martes en fr ncfort para prepararnos para una temporada a la que aspiramos a ganar los 4 torneos oficiales que disputaremos
4084239 valencia es un gran rival de ninguna manera esta supercopa es una piedra en el camino previo a la liga sino que es el primer torneo oficial de la temporada
4084240 ganar la supercopa ser a un buen principio de temporada para comenzar la liga con fuerza y vamos a intentar ganarla como la liga la champions y la copa del rey
4084241 convertir los que sean necesarios todos los delanteros lo que quieren es marcar muchos goles la pasada campa a consegu ocho y si esta temporada son m s mejor
4084242 por suerte el real madrid tiene cuatro delanteros que vemos a luchar por un puesto o por dos vamos a ir con ley es una competencia sana
4084243 hay cuatro grandes jugadores eso me pone contento y me hace pensar en trabajar cada d a m s
4084244 el otro d a le vi bien esperemos que se quede y se tome la mejor decisi n lo veo contento como siempre
4084245 creo que hoy en d a estamos bien pero esa es una decisi n de la junta directiva si viene alg n refuerzo bienvenido sea y sino la plantilla est capacitada para pelear por los cuatro t tulos
4084246 lo que siento es l stima de no poder estar envidia no porque los jugadores que est n ah se lo tienen bien merecido
4084247 pero ya pas ahora estoy con el madrid aunque viendo obviamente a mi selecci n porque hay compa eros pero centrado en la pretemporada y tampoco me vino mal realizar toda la pretemporada con el madrid
4084248 were not going to be able to fathom what the world may be like in 20 years if we arent able to reduce emissions
4084249 none of the eight leading industrial nations have taken sufficient measures needed to be considered in line with the target to limit a worldwide increase in temperatures to 2 degrees centigrade

4084253 i think were seeing a new generation in the backroom staff
4084254 its not that the previous generation havent done a great job they have but weve got a new generation of people as well
4084255 weve invested more money in the academy this summer weve extended the gym and brought in hot and cold baths which can be quite crucial for injury prevention
4084256 everything is designed to help the team go forward in what we do behind the scenes were not making a big fuss of it but the players can see it and appreciate it
4084257 when players come here from other clubs and see the training facilities and the facilities weve got to assist them they are pleasantly impressed compared to other clubs weve got a great set up its all about making sure weve got a really good infrastructure
4084258 i think the days of being able to produce a whole team from your academy are well and truly gone
4084259 but i strongly believe in the academy and believe its something which the club is very keen to develop
4084260 instead of having a long surgical scar they have 3 to 4 small scars from the ports in addition they take less narcotics and they can return to work sooner
4084261 in this extremely difficult mortgage environment we are pleased to continue to report a profit we also remain confident that the monetization of our mortgage loan portfolio will continue to occur without a material loss
4084262 prior to 2007 the company was externally advised in early 2006 i recommended and the board of directors approved the suspension of new sub prime mortgage originations and investments this was the correct strategy during 2007 our new management team promptly recognized asset impairments and reduced borrowings with free cash flow in the first half of 2008 these actions restored profitability and prevented material asset write downs
4084263 we are very pleased with the 2nd quarter financial results our strong financial performance reflects implementation of our growth strategies in a favorable market environment as china embraces more energy efficient products smartheat stands to benefit greatly from chinas green movement towards clean environment as our efficient energy saving products reduce heat energy use by as much as 50 we look forward to continued execution of our growth plan as we enter two of smartheats strongest quarters

4084267 our second quarter results demonstrate a continuation of the strong momentum we are building in the market place
4084268 we are achieving the goals we have set for the organization including delivering improved gross margins
4084269 reflecting our growth during the second quarter we were pleased to announce new client agreements with viant holdings one of the largest ppo networks in the united states as well as emerald health networks ohios premier ppo network provider additionally we gained a foothold into the all important midwest union market with the signing of two new client agreements with iron workers local 295 trust fund and operative plasterers and cement masons local 692 we are honored to be working with these two key union organizations and in addition to our more traditional clientele hope to sign similar agreements with other unions as time goes on
4084270 satellite discoveries such as blackbird allow for quick and cost effective tie backs to existing infrastructure which generates incremental value
4084271 overall i am pleased with our fiscal year 2008 results as the business fundamentals in the operating units continued to be solid throughout the year and remained solid during the fourth quarter particularly in light of the market conditions in which they were achieved our full year non gaap earnings per share of 1 42 were within our latest earnings per share guidance of 1 35 to 1 45 non gaap which excludes one time transition expenses we finished the year 0 21 per share higher than the mid point of our original guidance provided approximately one year ago the first half of fiscal year 2008 was driven by significantly higher than expected trading volumes and the one time benefit from both termination fees and the timing of our ramp up in spending to build out our public company corporate infrastructure and investments the second half of our fiscal year was driven by solid operating fundamentals in the core investor communication business which represents over 70 of our revenues and earnings even in the current market environment i am confident in our ability to extend our market leadership position as we move into our 2009 fiscal year
4084272 i am pleased that our operating units are projected to continue to generate solid performance in our 2009 fiscal year with steady revenue growth in every quarter despite a challenging market environment when i consider the benefits from last years one time items in the non core areas of the business which were part of our over plan performance in fiscal year 2008 i am satisfied with the business units growth in our overall plan as we are expecting revenue and margin improvement in our consolidated core business units
4084273 as we move into our 2009 fiscal year i am excited about our strong market position in the core investor communication business and our prospects in that business segment as well as the prospects in our securities processing business segments as we continue to gain traction with our unique outsourcing offering we will use our strong cash flow to create value by completing strategic acquisitions paying an increased dividend and buying back an amount of shares to offset the dilution created by our equity compensation plans
4084274 either you are with us or you are with the terrorists
4084275 in the 1960s esquire was perhaps the nations most vibrant magazine sexy mischievous irreverent and hip and mr hillss idea of fiction as well as of the literary life fit into the ethos of the magazine perfectly
4084276 i am pleased our revenues have once again increased for the quarter and we have now continued our profitability for the second straight quarter i believe we can continue to grow our business and remain profitable
4084277 when we gain ul and fcc approvals the manufacturers we are in discussions with will be able to rapidly integrate our design for a dimmable cfl into its production line with minimal modifications shortening the lag time between a licensing agreement and bringing an actual product powered by purespectrum technology to market
4084278 by enabling the manufacturers to quickly introduce a dependable dimmable cfl product we will also accelerate the realization of substantial revenue generation from licensing agreements for purespectrum it is our expectation that multiple manufacturers will bring dimmable cfl products built with purespectrum technology to market by the first quarter of 2009

4084468 el escenario de conflicto est depende del gobierno que se vaya hacia ese escenario o hacia uno de resoluci n de problemas pendientes no de ahora sino de hace tiempo han hecho tantos enchastros como dice el melli de angeli con el sector de la carne con los productores ganaderos con los productores tamberos y agregado a eso el productor agr cola que primero ten a un problema con la resoluci n 125 y ahora tiene problemas estructurales los costos se han ido a la estratosfera
4084469 el productor invierte todos los a os 13 mil millones de d lares y parece que despu s somos los desabastecedores los cortadores de ruta el gobierno tiene que salir del lugar donde se meti la presidenta hace una conferencia de prensa y de lo nico que se acuerda cuando habla del campo es de cuando cortamos las rutas y de todas las plagas de egipto
4084470 se pierde plata se pierden dos tambos por d a en la republica argentina cada 12 horas hay un tambo menos en el pa s por eso el escenario de conflicto est a la vuelta de la esquina o se puede avanzar sobre un escenario distinto yo creo que cheppi no va a hacer una gesti n deslucida esa es una sensaci n que tengo scioli aparece intentando ser un interlocutor y nosotros preguntamos donde estaba cada uno durante los cuatro meses del conflicto y scioli estaba en los actos junto a n stor kirchner agredi ndonos por eso planteamos que la pr xima reuni n tambi n se haga con el gobernador de c rdoba juan schiaretti

4084478 maar een wet is er nog niet wij waarschuwen het hele jaar al dat mensen geen kaarten moeten kopen bij onoffici le ticketadressen of via marktplaats die kaarten zijn duur en soms nog vals ook
4084479 maar wij kunnen geen verantwoording nemen voor mensen die veel geld neerleggen voor hun kaartje

4084481 die site zou volgens mensen ook zwarthandel tegen woekerprijzen stimuleren maar de gedachte erachter is simpel als dat niet zou kunnen zou iedere verkoper alsnog naar marktplaats gaan voor de koper heeft de site een voordeel boven andere ticketsites mojo biedt de garantie dat de kaarten echt zijn de originele kaarten worden ongeldig gemaakt de koper krijgt van mojo nieuwe bovendien verdient mojo niet meer als een verkoper meer geld vraagt voor zijn ticket

4084513 they still think the u s is the epicenter of the world economy
4084514 the u s is still very important but as far as commodity demand is concerned the u s isnt the main game in town china is the biggest consumer and increasingly india
4084515 we changed the collection so it would appeal to lots of different women and a lot more women and we injected a new focus on the design
4084516 for example the one piece is about covering up i think its sexy when you have not as much material cut out of your costume

4084519 das zdf als bertragender fernsehsender hat den wunsch an den dfb herangetragen zwei dinge zu gew hrleisten da ist zun chst die optimale berichterstattung von den olympischen spielen in peking
4084520 wir wissen dass am abend keine live ereignisse mehr sind aber das publikum hat sich an die zusammenfassungen in der olympia highlightshow gew hnt zweiter aspekt ist das anliegen des zdf das l nderspiel mit interviews vorher und nachher optimal zu pr sentieren

4084522 we have set up a platform to support young designers and for foreign buyers to understand us correctly

4084526 es ist unwahrscheinlich dass wir in der n chsten zeit etwas ernsthaftes machen
4084527 wir wollen nicht noch eine tour machen ohne etwas neues und f r etwas neues sind wir noch nicht bereit
4084528 die letzten paar monate ohne produktiven output haben uns alle von der band entfernt
4084529 leider wird der 17 oktober unser letzter auftritt in diesem jahr und wahrscheinlich auch f r eine nicht absehbare zeit sein

4084532 were excited to be releasing action 4 to the dekaron fans
4084533 the game has grown beyond our expectations since its launch earlier this year and the amount of free content to what is already a huge game is astounding and were confident it can take dekaron to the next level
4084534 safety is at the heart of what we do and we want this campaign to send a strong message to young drivers in co mayo that losing your licence may not be the only penalty for driving under the influence of drugs it could also take your life or someone elses too
4084535 we are also encouraging parents to stress the dangers of speed and drink driving to their teenage children let this be a joyous occasion and not a memorable occasion for all the wrong reasons
4084536 what are the top 3 characteristics or attributes that distinguish a forget it from a gotta have prospective employee
4084537 they were travelling in white toyota land cruisers that were clearly marked as irc vehicles as humanitarian vehicles
4084538 their policy was never to travel with weapons in the car so there wouldnt be any doubt that theyre a peaceful humanitarian organisation

4084541 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season under way that does not bode well for retailers
4084542 i think there are too many negatives and the negatives are too large for a gasoline price decline to change the story significantly
4084543 men kan het wel vergeten om het nog over de territoriale integriteit van georgi te hebben het is gewoon onmogelijk om zuid osseti en abchazi te laten aanvaarden dat zij gedwongen kunnen worden om weer deel van georgi uit te maken
4084544 de russische troepen zijn bezig de stad gori en de haven van poti te vernietigen
4084545 ze zijn gori aan het opblazen ook de haven van poti moet eraan geloven ze vernietigen de nieuwe wegen die zijn aangelegd in het westen van georgi
4084546 theres a sense today that college students are very busy with their schedules and their lives and in order for them to take time out they need to be incentivized
4084547 if you believe that judaism is a viable religion for many different reasons and youre able to show it in a way thats truly meaningful thats truly exciting
4084548 and i dont think you need to pay people to do that
4084549 we simply want to try to introduce young jews who havent had the opportunity to learn about judaism
4084550 they go to university and might be well versed about science mathematics and literature but their jewish education may be very fragile
4084551 aishcafe was kind of the beginning of wanting to know more about judaism and really identify with my judaic roots
4084552 to me it was an avenue for religious growth that was something i wanted to do for a while and this was an opportunity to do it
4084553 i really felt i had something i could relate to
4084554 for me and for a lot of people theres a sense that religion can be backwards but this shows it in another light
4084555 we voelden ons erg aangetrokken tot elkaar hij ging er helemaal voor en kwam achter me aan zijn vrienden vertelden me dat hij me leuk vond en ik vond hem er leuk uitzien
4084556 hij moest zich voorbereiden op de komst van de baby en we moesten er mee stoppen
4084557 zelfs nadat we niet meer met elkaar naar bed gingen kuste we nog af en toe nu zie ik hem nog minimaal n keer per week
4084558 de koffers werden allemaal gesorteerd per maatschappij en per vlucht om de teruggave te bespoedigen
4084559 tijdens het weekend zou de meeste bagage terugbezorgd moeten zijn
4084560 hij moet rusten en de prioriteit geven aan het opnieuw behalen van een basisplaats bij zijn club
4084561 tijdens de tweede week lopen er veel atleten met hun broek open rond
4084562 anders kan ik het niet uitdrukken de hormonen h voor een pak atleten vormen de spelen een unieke kans om van bil te gaan al die tijd zijn ze uitsluitend met hun sport bezig geweest nu mogen de remmen eindelijk los ze worden uit hun doornroosjesslaap gewekt en kunnen plots volgas geven
4084563 je kan ook je slag proberen te slaan in de discotheek van het dorp of in de chill out
4084564 velen gaan vooraf al op verkenning in het zwembad dat kan je gerust met een vleeskeuring vergelijken er zijn al veel tijdelijke koppeltjes ontstaan door het zwemmen
4084565 geen militair ter wereld kan een sportman stoppen die een feestje wil bouwen dat er een tot l alcoholverbod heerst in het dorp zeg je dat kunnen ze nooit maken wie iets niet naar binnen kan smokkelen drinkt het gewoon buiten op zo heb ik er al velen straalbezopen zien terugkeren of er ook drugs in het spel zijn dat heb ik in het olympisch dorp nog nooit gezien neen
4084566 vooral in het beachvolley heb je fraaie meiden rondlopen ik weet nog dat ik in olympische brochures altijd eerst naar hen ging loeren al is lolo jones de amerikaanse hordenloopster ook best sexy

4084568 the ioc does disapprove of any attempts to hinder a journalist who is going about doing his job seemingly within the rules and regulations
4084569 this we hope has been addressed we dont want to see this happening again
4084570 the three parks being opened is based on the constitution of china that people are allowed to demonstrate if they have some issues
4084571 i think thats one step further for china to open up and i think its very good gesture
4084572 in china nobody will be persecuted or placed under house arrest because of their speech only those who break laws will be punished in accordance with the law
4084573 chinese citizens in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights and freedoms
4084574 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4084575 we can see that the petitioners who made this attempt to speak have now suffered the consequences
4084576 sadly i think the protest zones are just a trap at some level
4084577 herzlichen gl ckwunsch an dieser stelle nat rlich auch von mir

4084579 tivemos timas atua es nesta pr temporada como contra o frankfurt na ter a feira e estamos preparados para uma temporada em que queremos ganhar os quatro torneios que disputaremos
4084580 ganhar a supercopa seria bom para come ar o espanhol com for a e tentaremos ganha la assim como a copa do rei o espanhol e a champions
4084581 o valencia um grande rival de nenhuma forma a supercopa uma pedra no caminho mas sim o primeiro torneio oficial da temporada
4084582 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4084583 we dont want them here what we need is friendship and good relations with the russian people
4084584 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
4084585 we let her stay here and now shes blaming everything on us

4084587 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
4084588 and also i feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together
4084589 you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily would rule tom ridge out
4084590 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4084591 introduces the highlights and features thatll help you make the most of your wowio experience
4084592 we understand the team has apologized and meant no offense the matter rests there for the ioc
4084593 i think they meant it as a friendly thing they are really nice guys as you know they have chinese sportswear brand li ning as sponsors
4084594 i dont give more importance to it we are talking in our bid about inclusiveness we are talking about how we want to use the sports values to change to create a new model of living together in madrid we live with 190 nationalities together
4084595 was generated by the bad faith shown by several media organizations that wanted to damage the image of not only the feb but also our country and our sport
4084596 this should just be about sports without any of that other noise
4084597 we feel bad but there is too much talk about it we are a very multicultural country in spain we are for sure going to apologize
4084598 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss
4084599 if they were georgians perhaps they could have been influenced by the invasion

4084621 all that stuff that happened with shia definitely didnt help things
4084622 itll cut down on the janky apps that show up in installer and could potentially damage the phone its actually pretty easy to mess up your iphone by adding unknown sources to installer and having apple bless them before publishing should make things a little safer
4084623 you want your work to be shown and for that the app store will be extremely effective
4084624 the fee might be a barrier initially but i expect to see publishing houses pop up that will market their app under their brand to the app store for a cut of the profits
4084625 there will likely be a lot of apps available in the store that are free open source like most other platforms as palm and windows mobile developers can attest you cant charge a ton for your apps if you expect them to sell to a casual market
4084626 there are a number of things you just cant do with the sdk
4084627 skype and voip are obvious examples the app store apps also dont allow background tasks inhibiting a lot of lojack type apps like a friend finder because the phone cant upload location data in the background while other apps are running
4084628 i understand apples approach and i dont disagree but i can have my own goals which dont fit into apples overall desire to keep their platform stable and pure
4084629 there are dozens of iphone shareware apps out there already
4084630 we are seeing prices for novelty titles go up and we think the next year will be significantly different in terms of what is being published there have been some wonderful books out there and we hope publishers wont lose sight of that but perhaps some of the weaker areas will die back one area for concern is where the r r p for customers becomes prohibitive
4084631 we will have to look at price increases because labour costs printing and materials have all gone up were going to work through that there is no way we will cut our baby and pre school lists but we will have to work harder with our printers and give ourselves longer lead times to make sure we meet our schedules
4084632 the past three to four months have been impossible normally printers keep prices steady for a number of months but even with reprints id be getting new quotes in a couple of weeks its impossible for our sales teams to sell a book because they dont know how much the cost will be going up
4084633 if they took a book last year they have expectations of the price of a reprint and have set a retail price

4084637 anpassung der landnutzung an den klimawandel in der sub sahara region
4084638 das deutsche klimarechenzentrum hat weltweit unterschiedliche szenarien des k nftigen klimas berechnet dieses globale verst ndnis der ver nderungen im 21 jahrhundert hilft jedoch den menschen in den betroffenen regionen westafrikas wenig sich auf die damit verbundenen herausforderungen vorzubereiten
4084639 aus diesen forschungsergebnissen wollen wir m glichkeiten einer angepassten pflanzenproduktion f r mensch und tier ableiten und damit die bev lkerung speziell die kleinbauern in westafrika bei ihren anpassungsbestrebungen unterst tzen
4084640 seit vielen jahren ist allerdings bekannt dass hba1c ergebnisse die durch unterschiedliche methoden und laboratorien erstellt werden nicht vergleichbar sind
4084641 in den 70er jahren wurden tats chlich noch karteikarten mit den einzelnen informationen geschrieben mit fotosatz wurde die biographie gesetzt dann wurde gedruckt
4084642 1900 ist dabei nur das erscheinungsjahr wer zum fund eines steinzeitdolches am bodensee mehr informationen sucht wird also auch f ndig
4084643 zwar versteht sich die bibliothek in erster linie als service einrichtung f r die forschenden lehrenden und studierenden der universit t aber mit der bodensee datenbank strahlt sie auch weit in die region hinaus damit stellt die bibliothek der gan zen region und allen am bodensee interessierten ein ged chtnis des bodensees zur verf gung einfach und frei im internet zug nglich
4084644 ich habe im laufe der jahre eine art scanner blick entwickelt bin immer auf der suche nach neuen sch tzen f r die datenbank
4084645 wenn es neue titel zum thema bodensee gibt m ssen die einfach in die datenbank rein

4084654 having acquired our long standing uk partner as the keystone for starlims europe we are poised to take advantage of the increasing number of opportunities within europe and to enhance our local professional services capabilities
4084655 the uk team represents an exceptional lims talent pool with many years of experience selling implementing and supporting starlims products having closed the acquisition in may we are already deep into the integration process and actively hiring additional sales and service staff to support growing uk and pan european activities
4084656 we are delighted to announce that joe peden will join us as general manager of starlims europe bringing a wealth of expertise in almost every area of the lims business as well as proven leadership experience
4084657 with joe pedens leadership we believe starlims europe can make significant advances in terms of sales marketing and project delivery leading to substantial market share growth in this region
4084658 starlims is uniquely positioned to leverage its leadership position in the global lims market and make a significant leap forward in the european region
4084659 i can think of no other lims solution that can deliver a comprehensive integrated multi site web based laboratory informatics platform and that is precisely what many europe based companies are seeking i look forward to working with the starlims team to further develop the companys reach in the european lims markets
4084660 this latest infill drilling confirms continued mineralization throughout the nokomis deposit as well as shorter higher grade intervals within our wide zones of mineralization we are moving into the pre feasibility and mine planning stage of the nokomis deposit and the infill drilling program results will be continuously incorporated into the upcoming studies

4084664 theres no question that we are in a mass extinction spasm right now
4084665 amphibians have been around for about 250 million years they made it through when the dinosaurs didnt the fact that theyre cutting out now should be a lesson for us
4084666 my feeling is that behind all this lies the heavy hand of homo sapiens
4084667 we have these great national parks here that are about as close as you can get to absolute preserves and there have been really startling drops in amphibian populations there too
4084668 but then they disappeared again and this time there were carcasses
4084669 its been called the most devastating wildlife disease ever recorded
4084670 the frogs have really been hit by a one two punch
4084671 although its more like a one two three four punch
4084672 our work needs to be seen in the context of all this other work and the news is very very grim
4084673 the chemical details of how the atmosphere removes nitric acid have not been clear
4084674 this gives us important insights into this process without that knowledge we really cant understand the conditions under which nitric acid is removed from the atmosphere
4084675 this becomes important in emerging industrial nations such as china india and brazil where there are automobiles and factories that are unregulated
4084676 this chemistry will give us insight into the extent that acid rain will be a future concern
4084677 weve speculated about this unusual atmospheric species for many years and then to actually see it and learn about its properties was very exciting
4084678 the reaction involving this molecule proceeds faster as you go to lower temperatures which is the opposite of most chemical reactions
4084679 the rate of reaction also changes depending on the atmospheric pressure and most reactions dont depend on external pressure the molecule also exhibits unusual quantum properties
4084680 this is not how we explain chemistry to high school students
4084681 heres a situation where we were studying this purely environmental problem but because the findings are so fundamental it may have broader ramifications to biological systems that depend on hydrogen bonds
4084682 the key is knowing where to look and how to identify new chemical entities and with the computing resources we have at purdue we can help identify processes to within experimental uncertainty
4084683 we couldnt have done this without the supercomputing power that we have available
4084684 unless a brokered convention threatens to break out these political gatherings tend to produce very little real news
4084685 it will be something completely different from what ive ever done im just putting it together at the moment but they will be very upscale dresses and likely will start at around 1 200 retail im going to be using very expensive fabrics and finishes lots of embroideries

4084690 colins right here as a southern male i must admit i looked at the rebel flag as a part of my heritage at one time but as i got older grew and became more educated i realized exactly what it is used for now it may have been an important part of the southern past but now these sad uneducated men use it for hatred i was born in the south raised in the south and i still live in the south however i will never agree that the rebel flag is still a symbol of our heritage

4084693 i feel that the move to ulster will be a great opportunity for both me and my family
4084694 im really looking forward to playing in europe the move is a great opportunity to see ireland and the united kingdom
4084695 but i want to experience the famous northern ireland culture first hand and im sure well end up venturing across to mainland europe for holidays which we are all excited about
4084696 meeting new people and seeing new places is always exciting and i cant wait to join the rest of the squad and get stuck into some serious training for the new season
4084697 however the person im most excited about meeting is my new son who is due in november my wife and myself are very excited about the impending new addition to our family

4084700 part of it is a higher fertility rate for some of the minority groups hispanics in particular
4084701 those groups also tend to be more of the childbearing age non hispanic white people tend to be a little bit older
4084702 thus one in three u s residents would be hispanic
4084703 theyre in a higher mortality rate nonminority groups tend to be older and dying off faster
4084704 whos going to do the jobs that are characteristically held right now by certain types of people
4084705 its a projection and things like the baby boom generation couldnt be predicted
4084706 the theme is mission responsible and these students are so bright and so creative in their solutions
4084707 ive learned a lot more about business and gained experience on every skill
4084708 this has helped me prepare for university and future employment

4084723 i cannot allow these delays to impact on the care of those vulnerable adults and children who rely on health and social care services
4084724 however i must also ensure that people who work with some of the more vulnerable people in society do not pose any risk to those they are supposed to be helping
4084725 while the legislation will help employers hire staff before full criminal record checks have been completed there will still be robust safeguards and monitoring arrangements in place to ensure that all applicants are suitable for the positions to which they are appointed
4084726 the protection of children and young people is of paramount importance and these new arrangements are to be introduced as a temporary measure only
4084727 employers across the education sector will be able to fill vacancies for the new academic year on the understanding that full checks will be completed as soon as possible
4084728 this will help ensure continuity of service in our schools
4084729 knowledge in itself is fine but the actual tranferble skills are what matters and i think we have to strengthen those at every level

4084737 if euro area gdp growth in the third quarter does show some positive growth then in our view the ecb is unlikely to yield to pressure for lower rates at least during this year
4084738 many players are keen to sell the euro and the pound as the outlook for the economy and monetary policy in europe is very uncertain
4084739 its very difficult now to find positive factors to help these currencies to bounce back

4084783 when we upgraded to a new larger apartment two years ago for our family of now four we turned down the poor excuse for a kitchen it was going to be fitted with took the builders credit and went with our own selection of udden free standing components the upside of this relatively inexpensive product line by ikea designer ehl n johansson is the use of honest materials all durable and recyclable except for particle board to achieve a modern industrial look its european space conscious features are also great but the downside was the higher cost of outfitting it with matching 24 inch kitchen appliances where we live in north america my udden hack was to recycle my custom 3 drawer cabinet to fit a fisher amp paykel single dishdrawer keeping only the top varde drawer for cutlery the cabinet was too narrow to accommodate the dishwasher space was created to specifications by reducing the cabinet to its top third and by designing a platform that is both supported and suspended i went so far as to use sheets of stainless steel to case in the dishdrawer on one side i wanted to share this hack to suggest an alternative dishwasher setup solution for udden kitchen owners the smaller dishwasher works for us and its a great if not the only way to keep the clean off the floor look of udden heres a close up of my varde drawer udden cube cabinet hack to fit a fisher amp paykel single dishdrawer heres an overall view of the kitchen and all the udden components it incorporates heres a close up of the space i created under the corner counter with an udden wire shelf to fit our recycling bin another hack i suppose and you finally get to see my half width udden console hack to fit a miele 24 inch cooktop sinking the numerar countertop 38 mm 1 1 2
4084784 i dont kid myself that it will always be thus but most people recognise that what they are watching is being done by athletes who may have from time to time have entered the moral maze but have come out the right side
4084785 but we have to be mindful that that is not sustainable forever youll end up with whats happened in the states where most parents dont want their kids to play american football

4084792 it will not be shown live on the west coast
4084793 this is a baseless rumor and i dont know the genesis of it
4084794 the situation will remain the same as it has for all of our prime time broadcasts
4084795 the reason that were showing this in the normal prime time patterns on the west coast is because this is when the majority of people are available to watch

4084825 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4084826 nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4084827 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
4084828 as asian pacific americans support u s olympic athletes some of whom are asian american it is disturbing to oca that spains basketball team would introduce such divisive imagery into the olympics
4084829 if they havent realized their mistake yet they probably will hear about it when the nba season comes back around
4084830 it was a gesture of affection and identification with the chinese people
4084831 ultimately there is a very good relationship between the chinese and spanish governments and there is no kind of conflict at all between the two peoples
4084832 from here i would like to declare that we have a huge respect for the east and their people
4084833 anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
4084834 much has been made about the poor air quality in china and the effect it is having on our athletes
4084835 but we have a serious home grown pollution problem right here and canadians ranging from the very young to the very old are paying the price
4084836 both of which rise during pollution episodes and in the few days afterwards and explain in significant part the number of acute deaths due to air pollution
4084837 canada gets a fair bit of pollution from the american midwest which drifts north comes across through ontario and continues right on through to quebec
4084838 sometimes people in rural areas think theyre escaping very nicely because they dont live in downtown wherever the fact is these masses of air pollution move across the countryside and some of our worst air pollution occurs in rural areas because it just happens to be downwind
4084839 this report shows for the first time the tragic effects of the toxic air that we breathe whether it is in my hometown of vancouver or across the country in st johns

4084849 faculty crunch is a real problem and all the iits are worried about it we will soon go on a global hunt to get fresh young quality teachers
4084850 in the next four five years we will need some 3 000 more professors we will go to international institutes across the world to fill this gap
4084851 there are around 50 000 people involved in higher research in top engineering and technology institutes of the world and we just need 3 000 young talented minds
4084852 we will go by quality as iits are known for it there will be no compromise on that
4084853 its a matter of fact that there is a shortage of quality teachers but while looking for global talent we will not sideline the quality teachers in india
4084854 while doing so the key point to be kept in mind is that the iits brand equity should not be diluted
4084855 we have much more fun on the day before independence day than on that day itself nothing can beat that feeling when you see the national flag being unfurled and fluttering in the breeze
4084856 i was bored with all the speeches which were more or less all the same thankfully it was cut short because of the rain and we started with our cultural programme inside the auditorium
4084857 we presented a short skit on gandhi for the cultural programme the script which was inspired by the film lage raho munnabhai showed how a young boy took up every challenge in his life with his gandhian approach
4084858 it was hilarious and yet had a subtle message for everyone especially amid such tense situations as in jammu and kashmir
4084859 we didnt have a cultural programme just the flag hoisting and a few speeches but the students put in all their ideas and creativity to make the entire event colourful and memorable

4084862 we continue to have great momentum in executing our business strategy resulting in strong financial performance for the first half of the year we see continued demand for our new services which were introduced into the market during the second quarter of 2008 medex healthcast and pass our preadmission survey services are being received very well and should continue to generate strong revenue and margin growth in the future
4084863 we are aggressively investing in the services that we believe are critical to our hospital partners our proprietary platform is a great foundation to continue to launch new innovative services given our results to date and demand for our services we are confident the remainder of 2008 will be just as strong if not stronger than the first half of the year

4084868 we are pleased that both of our operating units posted improved results versus the 2007 second quarter generating operating income for the quarter for each division as we continue to reduce our corporate costs
4084869 our second quarter results reflect the maturity of insurance marketings ahcp agency into a profitable operation combined with a modest turnaround in consumer plans results
4084870 however these positive earnings trends are more than offset by regional healthcares 2008 losses and the substantial albeit lower costs attributable to operating as a publicly traded company
4084871 looking ahead we are seeking further earnings growth in our insurance marketing and consumer plan divisions
4084872 during the second quarter of 2008 we secured preliminary commitments from two major health insurance carriers to provide insurance marketing with new proprietary or private label products and we added consumer plan sales and marketing resources and developed a relatively broad pipeline of new sales opportunities for the second half of the year principally with new call centers
4084873 the repositioning of our el paso based regional healthcare division and reduction of this units current negative operating cash flow is a top priority while our regional healthcare division continues to generate significant operating losses
4084874 we have received preliminary expressions of interest from several parties regarding leveraging regional healthcares claims administration capabilities and accessing our local proprietary hospital and physician networks we have also made progress toward reaching a satisfactory resolution with the department of justice in its investigation of certain activities of former management however our ability to rapidly change the structure of this operating division is currently being constrained by a dispute with one of our hospital network providers we are seeking to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible
4084875 we have commenced various discussions to actively explore potential strategic alliances and alternatives for the company

4085015 when we gain ul and fcc approvals the manufacturers we are in discussions with will be able to rapidly integrate our design for a dimmable cfl into its production line with minimal modifications shortening the lag time between a licensing agreement and bringing an actual product powered by purespectrum technology to market
4085016 by enabling the manufacturers to quickly introduce a dependable dimmable cfl product we will also accelerate the realization of substantial revenue generation from licensing agreements for purespectrum it is our expectation that multiple manufacturers will bring dimmable cfl products built with purespectrum technology to market by the first quarter of 2009
4085017 we have recognized a heightened sense of urgency surrounding the issue of dimming and we believe building product prototypes will enable manufacturers to realize their objective more quickly
4085018 at the same time the process of constructing a full line of dimmable purespectrum cfl products will allow us the chance to more readily introduce our dimmable technology to additional manufacturers

4085024 overall i am pleased with our fiscal year 2008 results as the business fundamentals in the operating units continued to be solid throughout the year and remained solid during the fourth quarter particularly in light of the market conditions in which they were achieved our full year non gaap earnings per share of 1 42 were within our latest earnings per share guidance of 1 35 to 1 45 non gaap which excludes one time transition expenses we finished the year 0 21 per share higher than the mid point of our original guidance provided approximately one year ago the first half of fiscal year 2008 was driven by significantly higher than expected trading volumes and the one time benefit from both termination fees and the timing of our ramp up in spending to build out our public company corporate infrastructure and investments the second half of our fiscal year was driven by solid operating fundamentals in the core investor communication business which represents over 70 of our revenues and earnings even in the current market environment i am confident in our ability to extend our market leadership position as we move into our 2009 fiscal year
4085025 i am pleased that our operating units are projected to continue to generate solid performance in our 2009 fiscal year with steady revenue growth in every quarter despite a challenging market environment when i consider the benefits from last years one time items in the non core areas of the business which were part of our over plan performance in fiscal year 2008 i am satisfied with the business units growth in our overall plan as we are expecting revenue and margin improvement in our consolidated core business units
4085026 as we move into our 2009 fiscal year i am excited about our strong market position in the core investor communication business and our prospects in that business segment as well as the prospects in our securities processing business segments as we continue to gain traction with our unique outsourcing offering we will use our strong cash flow to create value by completing strategic acquisitions paying an increased dividend and buying back an amount of shares to offset the dilution created by our equity compensation plans
4085027 i am pleased our revenues have once again increased for the quarter and we have now continued our profitability for the second straight quarter i believe we can continue to grow our business and remain profitable

4085391 we need people to build these things everything from phds to welders to make it happen we need people
4085392 its not going to be cheap and convenient but it will be a lot less costly if we face these issues squarely and we need the political will to get these things done

4085405 there needs to be some restraint on the increase in state and local taxes
4085406 folks this is wisconsin were talking about slowing the rate of increase in taxation we tried that a few years ago it was called tabor the taxpayers bill of rights remember the reaction
4085407 ten years of tabor a study of colorados taxpayers bill of rights
4085408 i could see very liberal folks saying you have to pass tabor thats my worst nightmare to institute a taxpayer bill of rights now
4085409 these schools that are crying the sky is falling and will fall under tabor are just barking up the wrong tree they are adding more teachers spending more per student and saying theres not enough money

4085424 he told us that he was beaten by his teacher
4085425 we went to the school that monday and we spoke to the principal and also to the teacher involved he didnt deny it
4085426 it seems he wanted to hit him on the hands but the child refused and was being difficult then he hit him on the head
4085427 the doctor found that nothing serious was wrong with the child the parents and the school understand each other i spoke to the father today and he didnt have a problem
4085428 my worry now is more over the effect of that incident
4085429 the media must not write things that have no foundation sometimes the reports are alarming and misleading its sensational news but it wont stop us from improving we believe in quality education
4085430 there is no way the students would have been able to pass is it the fault of the students now or the lecturer some of the same students did much better with other lecturers even in more complicated subjects in fact it is wrong to say they failed because they were never examined for what they were taught

4085439 we simply want to try to introduce young jews who havent had the opportunity to learn about judaism
4085440 they go to university and might be well versed about science mathematics and literature but their jewish education may be very fragile
4085441 aishcafe was kind of the beginning of wanting to know more about judaism and really identify with my judaic roots
4085442 to me it was an avenue for religious growth that was something i wanted to do for a while and this was an opportunity to do it
4085443 i really felt i had something i could relate to

4085453 the three parks being opened is based on the constitution of china that people are allowed to demonstrate if they have some issues

4085455 in china nobody will be persecuted or placed under house arrest because of their speech only those who break laws will be punished in accordance with the law
4085456 chinese citizens in accordance with the law enjoy the freedom of speech and other kinds of rights and freedoms
4085457 its clear to us that the protest zones are just a cynical public relations ploy on the part of the chinese authorities
4085458 we can see that the petitioners who made this attempt to speak have now suffered the consequences

4085508 it is critical to the alignment of the line of business and it as well as customer satisfaction to eliminate time consuming and error prone tasks such as the manual creation of test cases from requirements

4085518 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
4085519 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
4085520 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
4085521 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
4085522 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
4085523 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
4085524 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
4085525 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
4085526 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
4085527 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
4085528 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
4085529 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police

4085531 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
4085532 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined

4085543 what i know is about tourists and what i know is about bujagali and im proud of it i dont want to lose it
4085544 and within our plans bujagali is one of those sources of power that we badly need
4085545 we have received a limited notice to proceed and we think we shall do ground breaking sometime in august
4085546 bujagali is simply going to be recycling the same water that is flowing out of these two dams at the moment and generating more power than these two dams combined
4085547 this lake is very important for the people of uganda and the region in kenya tanzania and rwanda and if the levels continue to go down as they are now 30 million people will be affected
4085548 and especially now that the region including uganda is being hit by climate change and global warming we are saying there is not enough water to produce the 250 megawatts
4085549 if they decide to construct the dam forcefully many people will die
4085550 those ones who will be working on the dam will die people will get so many problems some will even become mad
4085551 anyway they are just fighting the development otherwise they have failed because the thing has already passed the construction is starting it is late for them now they cannot succeed

4085560 in a report released on wednesday the ombudsman is critical of the way the potential health risks from the spraying were communicated but the findings arent sitting well with anderton the minister accepts there are lessons to be learned but says the recommendation that such operations be subject to the resource management act is disingenuous he says anyone who knows about the rma process knows it can take years to complete anderton says biosecurity issues are such that if you wait years itll be all over and the problem wont be able to be fixed
4085561 the majority of pacifists either belong to obscure religious sects or are simply humanitarians who object to taking life and prefer not to follow their thoughts beyond that point but there is a minority of intellectual pacifists whose real though unacknowledged motive appears to be hatred of western democracy and admiration for totalitarianism pacifist propaganda usually boils down to saying that one side is as bad as the other but if one looks closely at the writing of the younger intellectual pacifists one finds that they do not by any means express impartial disapproval but are directed almost entirely against britain and the united states

4085595 weve seen this in the past before in motorolas razr line it was a very big seller but the first version of that phone had rf radio frequency problems they had to recall it fix it and put it back out there
4085596 it could end up drawing more power because now the phone thinks its getting a worse signal than it actually is when it goes to talk to the network it speaks louder than it needs to

4085610 farmers have already been forced to take a cut for milk while i understand that 20 per tonne has now been shaved off the payment for grain take this together with the recent figures released showing farmers being grossly underpaid by supermarkets for their produce with a 249 mark up on mushrooms alone and its clear that some sort of intervention is needed

4085626 heroes villains and velodromes inside track cycling with chris hoy
4085627 what chris and i were doing in the early 90s was classic british alpinism
4085628 he was just another one off success leave no ropes leave no trail there was no system so there was no legacy
4085629 i saw then the challenge was to convert those highly motivated highly talented individuals into a system
4085630 actually one of my biggest hurdles at first was dealing with this inflow of cash
4085631 first generation performance directors like me were suddenly expected to write business plans it was all very new
4085632 we had some good results but we couldnt really argue there was a system in place or that we had developed a culture
4085633 in fact it wasnt until late 2001 that the penny dropped i needed to clear out riders and coaches who werent obsessed with winning
4085634 it was a very hard thing to do and a lot of people found the process incredibly emotional it was our year zero
4085635 we managed to go beyond the individual and generate a critical mass of people pulling in the same direction thats what you need there can be no silos
4085636 the cyclists were a very diverse bunch but the wins and failures were shared its what gets you through the dark days
4085637 yes the funding was a huge help but it takes more than money success isnt a right you have to strive for it
4085638 buat masa ini kami masih terpaksa import roselle dari sudan dan pegaga dari indonesia jadi kami akan cuba untuk mempunyai ladang roselle dan pegaga yang lebih luas untuk kurangkan kebergantungan ini

4085648 for some time relative calm was maintained in south ossetia
4085649 the war games included a us navy supercarrier battle group an us navy expeditionary carrier battle group a royal navy carrier battle group a french nuclear hunter killer submarine plus a large number of us navy cruisers destroyers and frigates playing the
4085650 a strategic diversion has been created for russia the south ossetia capital has been shelled and a large georgian tank force has been heading towards the border american marines a thousand of them have recently been in georgia training the georgian military forces russia has stated that it will not sit by and allow the georgians to attack south ossetia this could get bad and remember it is just a strategic diversion but one that could have horrific effects
4085651 cases of possible threats by russia directed at georgia with the intention of taking control over the baku ceyhan pipeline
4085652 russia actively tends to isolate the central asian region from direct access to world economy especially to energy supplies if georgia government is destabilized western access to baku caspian sea and further will be limited
4085653 ever since the continents started interacting politically some five hundred years ago eurasia has been the center of world power the key to controlling eurasia says brzezinski is controlling the central asian republics
4085654 brzezinski russias invasion of georgia is reminiscent of stalins attack on finland
4085655 the russians deliberately provoked the fighting in south ossetia and timed it for the olympics this is a long standing russian effort to get rid of president saakashvili
4085656 and i want to stress im not a warmonger and i dont want a new cold war any more than dimitri does the russians wish to re establish a historic area of hegemony that includes ukraine and it is no accident that the other former soviet republics are watching this and extraordinarily upset as putin progresses with an attempt to re create a kind of a hegemonic space
4085657 the unipolar world refers to a world in which there is one master one sovereign one center of authority one center of force one center of decision making at the end of the day this is pernicious not only for all those within this system but also for the sovereign itself because it destroys itself from within what is even more important is that the model itself is flawed because at its basis there is and can be no moral foundations for modern civilization
4085658 unilateral and frequently illegitimate actions have not resolved any problems moreover they have caused new human tragedies and created new centers of tension judge for yourselves wars as well as local and regional conflicts have not diminished more are dying than before significantly more significantly more today we are witnessing an almost uncontained hyper use of force military force in international relations force that is plunging the world into an abyss of permanent conflicts we are seeing a greater and greater disdain for the basic principles of international law and independent legal norms are as a matter of fact coming increasingly closer to one states legal system one state and of course first and foremost the united states has overstepped its national borders in every way this is visible in the economic political cultural and educational policies it imposes on other nations well who likes this who is happy about this in international relations we increasingly see the desire to resolve a given question according to so called issues of political expediency based on the current political climate and of course this is extremely dangerous it results in the fact that no one feels safe i want to emphasize this no one feels safe because no one can feel that international law is like a stone wall that will protect them of course such a policy stimulates an arms race i am convinced that we have reached that decisive moment when we must seriously think about the architecture of global security
4085659 unless we stop russia unless the whole world stops it russian tanks will go to any european capital tomorrow

4085668 the second amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia
4085669 at least for now there is a tenuous cease fire in georgia as medvedev called off the dogs reports on four different eu and russian networks indicate sporadic shooting by georgia probably us israeli advisor mercenaries and the russians are returning fire when fired upon
4085670 we are bidding final farewell to the soviet union the ussr will never come back here we urge ukraine and other members of the cis to leave the organization which russia administers
4085671 the european union must be prepared to commit itself including on the ground
4085672 many countries have said that they are ready to join in
4085673 we are encouraged by what we saw this morning but we have to go through the united nations
4085674 you call it peacekeeping troops i dont call it that but controllers monitors european facilitators i think the russians would accept that
4085675 im convinced at the end of the day we will find an international peacekeeping force in the region with the eu at its heart
4085676 there are no signs of the russians letting in anyone else i dont really see it happening at the moment the russians are firmly in control
4085677 i do not think we should get lost today in long discussions about responsibility or who caused the escalation of the last few days
4085678 the european union will want to consider how it proceeds with the partnership and cooperation agreement
4085679 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki a russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
4085680 the principal element the respect of teritorial integrity of georgia is missing
4085681 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4085682 it is clear that georgia wants this dispute to become something more than a short if bloody conflict in the region
4085683 in the days ahead we will use us aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
4085684 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement to end this conflict
4085685 stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4085686 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4085687 the eu must be ready to engage including on the ground to support all efforts including those of the united nations and the osce for a lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflicts in georgia
4085688 somewhat like we use in the military you go into neighborhoods you clamp down you provide a secure environment for the people that live there and you make sure that the known criminals are kept under control
4085689 somethings screwed up i dont know whether they put the new high school in up there what happened with these new developments up in east greenbush but everything seems to dump into this creek
4085690 if there are contributing factors that exacerbated that flooding problem that occurred from development that occurred from storm water runoff we would certainly want to look at that
4085691 we continue to have an interest in developing this project and appreciate the support weve received from many people in the county for this proposed project there are however many variables in developing wind projects not the least of which is securing land
4085692 they couldnt tell us where they were going to put anything
4085693 i just cant sign over that land and let them come in and do whatever they want without any information
4085694 i think that it was a great opportunity for the town and for the region
4085695 its a type of thing that we need to be doing
4085696 each wristband has a unique number for data protection it is linked to a chip number and it contains a passive rfid tag
4085697 we were aware that some people would have a big brother is watching you mentality and we wanted to make sure there were no fears
4085698 a few companies do dvds where they top and tail this is the first one to put personal clips into a personal movie

4085702 estoy muy metida en el teatro no voy a hacer televisi n

4085705 the monies generated from energy produced will save taxpayers saco did it
4085706 we put it up in february we havent had much wind since we put it up
4085707 its not in our best interest where would the money come from we would not invest another penny
4085708 its pretty cool and its usually quiet sometimes it whines its just an annoyance like if you live next to a green light where cars stop and go all the time
4085709 on the coast you get high winds in the winter and were usually flat in the summer
4085710 there hasnt been much wind since we put it up but were very happy with it
4085711 if your boat was above this cable in 30 feet of water there was an 18 degree magnetic variation on your compass at the surface
4085712 there is concern about how stretching a cable across long island sound might impact the movement of lobsters that it would act like a fence along the central basin keeping lobsters out
4085713 has it who knows the lobster resource in long island sound has diminished so much it would be hard to tell
4085714 its something to be concerned about but how concerned we dont know
4085715 it doesnt directly affect us because the bottom there is sand and there arent many lobsters
4085716 what it will do is move the draggers over onto us
4085717 this is a very productive fishing area and the rocky piles at the base of these turbines which will be about 40 to 50 feet underwater would allow lobsters to go in and lay eggs
4085718 you hear about projects coming in but they usually end up coming to the south
4085719 at first glance of course it could be a great thing
4085720 but whos going to benefit from it the most where is the dollar going to go
4085721 is it going to go mainly to a company that comes from outside or is there going to be community involvement
4085722 but value added so we have an industry that supports it
4085723 when you look at the big picture of the cash flow of wind farms the money is quite small
4085724 the most significant proportion of money is in the profit generated by the wind farm and therefore the owners of the wind farm
4085725 the benefit is through land lease agreements fees paid to landowners to put the turbine on their land or to government if the wind turbines are installed on crown land
4085726 one is getting a contract for people to purchase the electricity
4085727 then theres a barrier to bring that electricity to the consumer because of the limitation of transmission lines from new brunswick to new england and thats a real problem right now
4085728 if duane says you dont need anything get it in writing and do what you need to do
4085729 it would be good overall for the environment it could work well for the environment and the birds if we come to some compromises
4085730 but thats way ahead of the game lets collect the data first
4085731 and thats it all its going to be doing is measure the wind it has no blades
4085732 we support alternative energy we support wind power but there are certain places where wind turbines should not go
4085733 has the potential to impact wildlife severely it has the potential for killing endangered species
4085734 i commend ms green for thinking the way shes thinking i think its a wonderful idea at the wrong place
4085735 this is about trying to keep the sport affordable for more masses of people to experience a lot of the things the appalachian trail people would like to see that land used for
4085736 regardless of what the study says its a resort customers would not appreciate having a bank of windmills thats contrary to what we need here
4085737 i was probably 50 feet away from wal mart from the front door
4085738 i was walking out and i had my purse on my shoulder

4085745 a friend of mine was doing up an old triumph it was 12 to 15 years old at the time
4085746 i said we ought to get something really old pre war i found a 1920s model in the breakers yard so i bought it for seven pounds and 10 shillings and took it home
4085747 it was so old it didnt have clutch you had to run and jump with it then one bike led to another
4085748 it is important to stress that whilst we do not routinely fund this drug at this time we always consider carefully any application from a patients doctor to fund a drugs use in individual cases where it is believed there may be exceptional circumstances
4085749 it is also important to stress that a patient has the right of appeal should they be unhappy with the outcome of an review panel decision
4085750 the stress of it just coming to terms with this terrible disease and at the same time knowing that robert is worried because he doesnt want to leave me penniless its just so terrible

4085758 it is vital that the communities of cornwall come together to oppose these unsustainable proposals which could have a disastrous effect on cornwall our local environment and infrastructure penwith the increase would be 63 on the original rss while in both north cornwall it is 76
4085759 it is mind boggling that unelected quangos and central government can come up with such ridiculous proposals which are not about tackling the affordable housing crisis in cornwall but are about promoting unsustainable house building for its own sake
4085760 the reality is that over the last decade the uk economy has been founded on uncontrolled and irresponsible lending which has left thousands overstretched and with little hope of clearing their spiralling debts
4085761 nowhere has this been clearer than in the housing market where the government has done nothing to control house prices preferring instead to see a vast over valuation of property with less well off home owners caught up with unmanageable debts as mortgage costs rise
4085762 indeed they have made it easier for the well off to own more than one property through tax breaks which has added further pressure to an already unsustainable market
4085763 like the tories before them labour has managed to preside over a so called boom fuelled by consumer debt and an out of control housing market leading to a greater divide between the haves and the have nots
4085764 at this time of rising energy costs mounting household bills and a vast array of difficult financial pressures central government needs to work with local councils to deliver policies that focus on the delivery of proper local needs affordable housing not masses of over priced open market housing
4085765 contact with living things have always been at the heart of emotional memory

4085813 in de winter van 1937 werd in vlissingen een ouder echtpaar vermoord de uitbaters van het caf keersluis ondanks een uitgebreide speuractie van de politie werd het misdrijf nooit opgelost de schrijver heeft een minutieus onderzoek uitgevoerd naar alles wat met de zaak te maken had afkomst achtergronden geruchten doodlopende sporen buren en relaties alles wat maar enigszins in verband met het echtpaar kon worden gebracht daarbij krijgt de lezer een goed beeld van de vlissinger samenleving in de jaren dertig van de 20e eeuw de schrijver had niet de pretentie de moord te kunnen oplossen het was hem onder andere te doen om duidelijk te maken wat voor impact zon moord heeft op een toch vrij gesloten gemeenschap jaren later werd er nog over gepraat de schrijver is zeker geslaagd op boeiende en prettige wijze wordt verslag gedaan van het onderzoek waarbij men zich erover kan verbazen dat er nog zo veel bewaard is gebleven vele functionele fotos verluchtigen het geheel dat vooral voor mensen uit de stad en uit de streek interessant is

4085827 clearly everybody would want every young person to get the best education possible provided for them
4085828 there will be all sorts of explanations for the differences and and they wont all necessarily lie in the education provision in the regions
4085829 the things that affect how young people perform in school are many and varied
4085830 there was an upward trend that began a couple of years ago that has accelerated
4085831 there are more candidates doing mathematics than at any time in the past
4085832 its important we have people with high mathematic skills so that has to be good news
4085833 the debate about qualifications is one worth having but not today young peoples qualifications should not be used as political footballs to be booted into touch when it suits an older more cynical generation
4085834 we welcome the increases in maths further maths the sciences and languages at a level
4085835 it is what we have been hoping for for several years the concerns we were talking about last year about the declining trends in those subjects has at last been turned around
4085836 they also show a good return on a decade of record investment and policies which have encouraged more young people to continue and achieve in education
4085837 the individual achievements of the thousands who have done so well should be celebrated we wish all those that have applied for university the best of luck with finding a suitable place
4085838 the government is letting down children in the more disadvantaged areas who as a result fall behind throughout their time in school
4085839 it underlines yet again the need for reform to create new good school places so that children in the less well off areas get the same opportunities as others
4085840 these young people have clearly worked hard and we should celebrate their success
4085841 but with one in four candidates now achieving an a grade we need to be sure that the most talented students are being properly stretched
4085842 ministers must work to find the reasons for this inequality and ensure that any improvements in our schools and colleges benefit all students
4085843 it will give us no room for manoeuvre for people who have missed their results because of illness or family issues or other discretionary issues
4085844 much will be made of course of the percentage of entries awarded the top a grade lets put this into context each year approximately 3 of all 18 year olds taking a levels will gain three a grades or more
4085845 the a level is only one of a number of factors that universities take into account when selecting students universities are currently involved in a whole raft of changes to a levels and other qualifications to ensure the best fit between the student the institution and the course

4085870 un any i mig despr s daquella aprovaci estem pitjor
4085871 enlloc daugmentar la pres ncia de dones en els llocs de comandament de la gu rdia urbana ara no hi ha cap dona en actiu en les escales superiors abans nhi havia dues i el nombre de dones policies s molt inferior al que tenen altres cossos policials com s el cas dels mossos desquadra que actualment tenen un 22 2 de dones mentre que el cos de la gu rdia urbana no arriba ni al 10
4085872 aquest s un exemple clar dels discursos buits que fa un govern que diu que aposta per la igualtat per no fa despr s res per aconseguir la

4085885 nadsa will continue to inculcate and promote the interest amongst the youth in this cultural and healthy form of recreation it will furthermore continue with the standardisation of styles and syllabi promote well organised competitions and events and most challenging of all will try to obtain new members of different dance styles and forms by convincing dance studio owners that by becoming nadsa members they will become an integral part of this educational and development process and in addition thereto receive multiple benefits as nadsa members
4085886 by hosting the sadsfs agm in windhoek during june 2009 nadsa hopes to achieve even more exposure to the national and international dance sport fraternity as well as to expose namibia as a quality and capable hosting country in events competitions and alike
4085887 this is their first home game in the tri nations and they will be looking to put up a good performance
4085888 both teams have everything riding on this game if they want to take the title so we will be throwing everything at it there is no point saving ourselves for the next game we know we have to win so we will not hold back in any way
4085889 but their loose trio is very dangerous they are great ball runners and if they get momentum there is enough speed out wide with guys like bryan habana to finish off their chances
4085890 he is always in on the action but the effectiveness of any loose trio depends on whether you get front football or not and schalk can be a real menace when that is the case

4085896 the advantage of the chamber is you meet a lot of people quickly the disadvantage is you meet a lot of people quickly
4085897 we noticed we werent getting any clients from richmond or virginia
4085898 being a part of the chamber it will pay dividends in the sense of having our name out there with a reputable organization
4085899 i think ill know it was worth it if weve established enough contacts and generated enough business based on the membership
4085900 the chamber is a great way to meet hundreds of people in a short period of time
4085901 its working on a network thats critical most people dont get on a committee most just show up and try to sell people
4085902 how many dates does it take until you know if someone really cares
4085903 people dont realize that networking is like dating the fourth time youre compelled to want to help me back
4085904 if its a sole proprietor its the breakfast breaks if its a manger then its the invisions or business council the whos who of richmond is the chairmans circle
4085905 its also an opportunity to participate in shows and events
4085906 i feel its important to be involved in the community and for people to know youre involved
4085907 i guess id ask how active are they when new businesses open how do they get new members and when running a new business how would being a member of the chamber benefit us
4085908 we evaluate this as a positive measure and welcome it
4085909 cause for great optimism for peace and stability in the korean peninsula and northeast asia
4085910 we still have to examine whether north koreas declaration will fully and accurately reveal all of its nuclear programmes and whether all parties concerned will honour their promises
4085911 the issue will receive little attention during the us presidential election and after the new government is formed the de listing of north korea as a terrorism sponsoring nation would then be delayed
4085912 will the new host of the oval office take a new line towards north korea
4085913 it cannot be called a complete and accurate declaration if it did not state that nuclear weapons should be abandoned
4085914 took a deceitful strategy or broke the agreement the united states should immediately withdraw its policy of removing sanctions
4085915 do you want to go down in history as the president who made the decision to lose his most important ally across the pacific ocean
4085916 destined to make history as one of the most important landmarks of nuclear disarmament
4085917 it is possible that this sets a precedent for a procedure under which other de facto nuclear states will give up their ambitions to create this type of weapon of mass destruction
4085918 the document is flawed glaringly absent is the number of nuclear weapons north korea has developed
4085919 the kim regimes have time and again proven to be two of the hardest nuts to crack for members of the international community
4085920 we hope the north will enjoy economic aid security guarantees and diplomatic incentives in return for its complete nuclear disarmament
4085921 by which kim jong il made the people believe north korea was facing up to the global power the united states
4085922 this is pop culture encountering nazi germany and the holocaust with unprecedented force

4085942 as long as human rights abuses continue seemingly unabated the atmosphere of any negotiated settlement is fraught with potentially unacceptable compromises from a human rights perspective
4085943 they beat me like a dog political persecution of opposition activists and supporters in zimbabwe
4085944 hundreds of mdc activists who fled the violence in the weeks before the june 27 run off remain in hiding while mugabe supporting war veterans and youth militia continue to terrorise villagers in the rural areas
4085945 a number of question marks hovering over its composition acceptance and viability
4085946 depending on their answers can seriously affect the credibility legitimacy and outcome of these talks
4085947 these questions about the legitimate outcomes of elections electoral processes and ballot papers will largely be subsumed in a negotiated settlement in the same manner as a solution was found in kenya to stem the immediacy of the violence
4085948 whilst this is perhaps understandable from the perspective of stemming immediate violence it raises key questions about democracy and human rights and the political conditions that generate their long term guarantee
4085949 whilst the talks must be allowed to run their course and a solution will hopefully be found that places the rights of zimbabwean citizens to freedom from fear and want first those involved in the region must ensure that the precedents that are being set with respect to the ballot box electoral outcomes and human rights are not untenable and do not fundamentally become compromised in our region

4085988 stel nu dat ze enorm zijn gegroeid ten opzichte van ons dan zouden ze best naast ons kunnen roeien maar ruim zes seconden voorsprong is gewoon te gek in mijn beleving was vooraf iedereen in vorm en fysiek in orde na afloop zei geen van de vier roeiers dat er wat mis was gegaan op de video werd er prima geroeid bovendien zou ik een slechte vorm op tijd hebben zien aankomen

4085999 what we have done is take two very different approaches to the challenge of creating bulk metamaterials that can exhibit negative refraction in optical frequencies
4086000 both bring us a major step closer to the development of practical applications for metamaterials
4086001 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
4086002 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material
4086003 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
4086004 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
4086005 what makes both these materials stand out is that they are able to function in a broad spectrum of optical wavelengths with lower energy loss
4086006 weve also opened up a new approach to developing metamaterials by moving away from previous designs that were based upon the physics of resonance previous metamaterials in the optical range would need to vibrate at certain frequencies to achieve negative refraction leading to strong energy absorption resonance is not a factor in both the nanowire and fishnet metamaterials
4086007 sophisticated optical devices that are mechanically robust yet fully biodegradable biocompatible and implantable dont exist today
4086008 such systems would greatly expand the use of current optical technologies in areas like human and livestock health environmental monitoring and food quality
4086009 for example at a low cost we could potentially put a bioactive silk film in every bag of spinach and it could give the consumer a readout of whether or not e coli bacteria were in the bag before the food was consumed
4086010 silks spun by spiders and silkworms represent the strongest and toughest natural fibers known they offer many opportunities for functionalization processing and biological integration when compared to conventional polymers
4086011 we have optical devices embedded with enzymes that are still active after almost a year of storage at room temperature this is amazing given that the same enzyme becomes inactive if forgotten and left unrefrigerated for a few days

4086019 wir wollen auch die stimmen zu wort kommen lassen die anderer meinung sind
4086020 you know there are a number of places a conversation can go after a question like that
4086021 because as conversational ice breakers go its not in the top ten
4086022 maybe this isnt the best place to talk about it
4086023 i just want to know how you came to that conclusion
4086024 you mean how did i come to that conclusion despite the fact im this missions mushroom
4086025 it means that you keep me in the dark and feed me shit
4086026 this is a colonial union diplomatic mission and im colonial defense forces and you dont want me seen by the korba because you dont want my presence to be interpreted as provocation so while the rest of you head down to the planet and get to breathe real air and see actual sunlight i stay up here in this latrine of a spaceship training your technicians to use the field generator and catching up on my reading which is going well incidentally i just finished anna karenina
4086027 the moral is to stay away from trains the point is i know why im kept in the dark fine fair enough but im not stupid hart even if none of you tell me anything about the mission i can tell its not going well all of you deputies and assistants come back to the clarke looking like youve had the crap beat out of you all day long its a subtle hint
4086028 the mission isnt going well the korba havent been nearly as receptive to our negotiations as we thought they might be we want to try something new a new direction a new diplomatic tack
4086029 a new tack that is somehow focused on me getting punched
4086030 you know that everything im about to tell you is classified
4086031 im the only person on the clarke who doesnt know whats going on
4086032 a strong case for not letting trainees drive a battle cruiser
4086033 there was a disagreement between the head of the military and the korban civilian leadership that skyscraper is well was the korban administrative headquarters
4086034 are we trying to restore the civilian government because to be honest about it that doesnt really sound like something the cu would care about
4086035 before the coup the korba were barely on our radar at all they had a non expansionist policy they had their few worlds and theyd stood pat on them for centuries we had no conflict with them so we didnt care about them after the coup the korba are very interested in expanding again
4086036 not if we can point them toward expanding in the direction of some of our enemies
4086037 there are some races in this area who are pushing in on us if they had to worry about someone else theyd have fewer resources to hit us with
4086038 always happy to stick a knife in someone elses face but none of this has anything to do with me getting punched in the face
4086039 we made a tactical error this mission is a diplomatic one but the new leaders of korba are military theyre curious about our military and theyre especially curious about our cdf soldiers whom theyve never encountered because our races have never fought were civilians we dont have any of our military on hand and very little in terms of military capability to show them we brought them that field generator youve been training our technicians on but thats defensive technology theyre much more interested in our offensive capabilities and theyre especially interested in seeing our soldiers in action negotiations up to this point have been going poorly because were not equipped to give them what they want but then we let it slip that we have a cdf member on the clarke
4086040 come on harry dont look at me like that this mission is failing some of us need this mission to succeed my careers not exactly on fire you know if this mission goes into the crapper im going to get reassigned to an archive basement
4086041 id be more sympathetic if saving your career didnt require blunt force trauma for me
4086042 when we told them about you they got very excited and we were asked by the korbans new leader a direct request from the head of state harry if we would be willing to pit you against one of their soldiers in a contest of skills
4086043 it was strongly implied it would make a real difference in the tenor of the negotiations
4086044 let me remind you of the part where i said the mission was going into the crapper
4086045 besides the part where i get the crap kicked out of me i mean hart im cdf but im not a soldier im a technician ive spent the last several years working in the military science division of the forces thats why im here for gods sake im training your people to use technology we developed im not training them to fight im training them to twirl knobs
4086046 your body is still in top physical shape whether you use it or not your reflexes are still fast as ever youre still as strong as ever look at you harry theres nothing flabby or squishy about you youre in as good a shape as any soldier on the line
4086047 tell me harry everyone else on this mission is an unmodified human is there any one of us that you couldnt take in hand to hand combat
4086048 my point is whether or not im engineered for combat i havent been a soldier for a very long time
4086049 fighting isnt like riding a bicycle hart you cant just pick it up without practice if these guys are so hot to see cdf in action send a skip drone back to phoenix and request a squad they could be here in a couple of days if you make it a priority request
4086050 its not like ive been keeping it from you we told them about you they made the request and ten minutes later i was being hustled off to the shuttle back to the clarke to tell you and here we are
4086051 what is this skill contest they want me to have
4086052 its physical combat but its done as a sport like karate or fencing or wrestling there are three rounds you get scored on points there are judges from what i understand its mostly harmless youre not going to be in any real danger
4086053 and then when the mission fails and everyone on the mission is demoted into shit jobs and the korba ally themselves with our enemies and start looking at human colonies they can pick off you can bask in the knowledge that at least you came out of this all unbruised
4086054 so the plan is to go down there fight with one of their guys get beat up a little and everyone walks away happy
4086055 and she said for me to say to that by request she means that if you dont do them both she will find a way to make the rest of your natural existence one of unceasing woe and misery
4086056 we need to show the korba from the start that the reputation the cdf has is not undeserved
4086057 not knowing what the rules of the contest are how its played or whether im even physically capable of keeping up with it sure why not ill keep it close
4086058 there are three rounds one round with bongka those are like quarterstaffs harry one round of hand to hand combat and one round of water combat there are no set times for any round they continue until all three judges have selected a victor or until one of the combatants is knocked unconscious the chief judge here wants to make sure you understand this
4086059 the contest is performed in the nude so that its purely a test of skill no tricks youre okay with that
4086060 see if you can get them to crank up the thermostat
4086061 he says that they apologize that they are unable to give you a more attractive bongka
4086062 but that your height meant they had to craft one for you specially and they did not have time to hand it over to an artisan he wants you to know however that it is fully functional and you should not be at any disadvantage he says you may strike your opponent at will with the bongka and on any part of the body but only with the tips using the unmarked part of the bongka to strike your opponent will result in lost points you can block with the unmarked part however
4086063 i can hit anywhere arent they worried about someone losing an eye
4086064 he says that if you manage to take an eye then it counts every hit or attack with a tip is fair
4086065 apparently the korba can regenerate lost limbs and some organs eventually they dont see losing one as a huge problem
4086066 you and i are going to have a talk after all of this is done
4086067 the judge wants to know if you have a second if you dont have one he will be happy to provide you one
4086068 hart please make an effort to be useful to me
4086069 and im supposed to be in a bunk on the clarke reading the first part of the brothers karamazov
4086070 clearly this is a disappointing day for both of us suck it up hart tell him
4086071 now might be a good time for you to strip
4086072 the judge didnt say anything about it in the job description
4086073 im supposed to research your opponent and give you tips on how to beat him
4086074 am i correct in assuming that there are several species of legume that would do a better job being my second than you hart
4086075 and now as you can see im going spartan so a midget can whack me with a stick
4086076 he will signal the start of the round with his horn and will use it again at the end of the round when the round ends there will be a few minutes while they set up for the next round you can use that time to rest and to confer with your second do you understand
4086077 im kind of wondering what the thinking was on that handstand
4086078 the thinking was that if i didnt do something my ankle bones would be a fine powder
4086079 i was in a rush hart i was making it up as i went along
4086080 i dont think it worked the way you wanted it to
4086081 well maybe if i had a second who told me these little bastards could high jump two meters straight up from a squat i would have tried something else
4086082 yes but we want you to lose by just a little
4086083 you need to keep it closer than this ambassador abumwe is glaring a hole through the back of your head right now no dont look
4086084 hart if i could have made it closer i would have
4086085 youre not the one whose kidneys were mashed into p t in the first round
4086086 i was just giving him what he gave me he was still breathing at the end of the round hes fine and now the contest is closer which is what you wanted
4086087 you have no idea how much it kills me to do this
4086088 thats really not the way we expected you to do that
4086089 you asked me to keep it close and you asked me to lose
4086090 the korban leader who incidentally you caused to get drenched in fruit juice when you kicked your competitor into the stands wanted to know why you let your competition win we had to admit we told you to lose he was delighted to hear it
4086091 well probably but thats not the point the point was he said that your willingness to follow orders even when winning was in your grasp showed that you could make a short term sacrifices for long term goals he saw you almost winning as making a point about cdf strength and then losing as making a point about the value of discipline and since he seemed quite impressed with both we said those were indeed exactly the points we had wanted to make
4086092 and it looks like well come out of this with an agreement after all you saved the negotiations harry thank you
4086093 she thanks you for your service and wants you to know shes recommended you for commendation she also says that never wants to see you again your stunt worked this time but it could just as easily have backfired all things considered youre not worth the trouble
4086094 but i like the idea that i had choreographed having the crap kicked out of me down to that level of detail makes me feel like a genius it does
4086095 it does occur to me that we know the answer to another question though
4086096 if this is what it takes to find out harry
4086097 always happy to stick a knife in someone elses face but none of this has anything to do with me getting punched in the face
4086098 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
4086099 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbours occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
4086100 die lage in gori ist im gro en und ganzen ruhig
4086101 a jobs just come up that you might like to look at i think its right up your street
4086102 theres something odd going on down at the funny farm
4086103 the trouble is going to be telling whether its just the usual or a more serious deviation normally id ask boris to check it out but hes not available this month it has to be an sso 2 or higher and i cant go out there myself so how about it
4086104 not so quick why cant you go have you got a meeting scheduled or something
4086105 its not the usual i would go but they might not let me out again
4086106 theyre sensitive to the stench of magic its okay for you youve only been working here what six years all you need to do is turn your pockets inside out before you go and make sure youre not carrying any gizmos electronic or otherwise but ive been here coming up on fifteen years and the longer youve been in the laundry it gets under your skin visiting the funny farm isnt a job for an old hand bob it has to be someone new and fresh who isnt likely to attract their professional attention
4086107 but the secure try and go there on your own not that the sisters will let you but i mean dont even think about trying it some of them are well we owe them a duty of care and a debt of honour they fell in the line of duty and all that but thats scant consolation for you if a senior operations officer whos succumbed to paranoid schizophrenia decides that youre a blue hades and gets hold of some red chalk and a hypodermic needle before your next visit hmm
4086108 mr howard im dr renfield youre not carrying any electronic or electrical items or professional implements fetishes or charms
4086109 come on we dont want to annoy matron she doesnt like people obstructing the corridors
4086110 we cant use electric ones except for matron of course come into my office ill fill you in
4086111 too many of our clients arent safe around modern electronics we even have to be careful what games we let them play lego and meccano are completely banned obviously and there was a nasty incident involving a game of cluedo back before my time any board game that has a non deterministic set of rules can be dangerous in the wrong set of hands
4086112 nurse gearbox this is mr howard he is not a new admission
4086113 its a grid please not a pentacle um matron is electrically powered
4086114 yes mr howard we allow electrical equipment in matrons basement as well as here in the staff suite only the areas accessible to the patients have to be kept power free the sisters are fully equipped to control unseemly outbursts pacify the over stimulated and conduct basic patient care tasks they also have vohlman flesch thaumaturgic thixometers for detecting when patients are in danger of doing themselves a mischief so i would caution you to keep any occult activities to a minimum in their presence despite their hydraulic delay line controls their reflexes are very fast
4086115 sorry about that there are some things you really shouldnt talk about in front of the sisters among other things matron is very touchy about how long shes been here and everything they hear she hears
4086116 did mr newstrom brief you about this installation before he pitched you in at the deep end
4086117 i gather its pretty normal to fob inspections off on a junior manager
4086118 you could say so its a matter of necessity really too much exposure to esoterica in the course of duty leaves the most experienced operatives carrying traces of hmm disruptive influences
4086119 you know what our purpose is dont you our job is to isolate and care for members of staff who are a danger to themselves and others thats why such a small facility we only have thirty beds has two doctors on staff it takes two to sign the committal papers matron and the sisters are immune to cross infection and possession but have no legal standing so dr hexenhammer and i are needed
4086120 so the sisters have a tendency to react badly to senior field agents
4086121 although they havent made a mistake and tried to forcibly detain anyone who wasnt at risk for nearly thirty years now
4086122 milk no sugar nobody at head office seems able to tell me much about them
4086123 i dont see why not we file regular updates with human resources
4086124 its the paper thing apparently manual typewriters dont work well with the office document management system and someone tried to feed them to a scanner a couple of years ago then they sent the originals for recycling without proof reading the scanner output anyway it turns out that we dont have a completely accurate idea of whos on long term remand here and hr want their superannuation files bringing up to date as a matter of some urgency
4086125 so someone had an accident with a shredder again and no photocopies
4086126 well i suppose thats just typical were just another of those low priority outposts nobody gives a damn about i suppose i should be grateful they sent someone to look into it
4086127 weve got fourteen short stay patients right now mr howard of those i think the prognosis is good in all cases except perhaps merriweather if you give me your desk number ill post you a full list of names and payroll references tomorrow the four long term patients are another matter they live in the secure wing by the way all of them have a nurse of their own just in case three of them have been here so long that they dont have current payroll numbers the system was first computerized in 1972 and theyd all been permanently decertified for duty before that point and one of them between you and me im not even sure what his name is
4086128 perhaps you could introduce me to the inmates the transients first then the long term ones
4086129 but theyre the long term residents i assure you they each need a full time sisters attention just to keep them under control
4086130 but hr have got a bee in their bonnet about some european directive on workplace health and safety and long term disability resource provisioning that requires them to appoint a patient advocate to mediate with the ombudsman in disputes over health and safety conditions
4086131 its bullshit you know it and i know it but weve got to comply or questions will be asked this is the civil service after all and theyre still technically laundry employees even if theyve been remanded into long term care so someone has to do the job my managers played spin the bottle and i got the job so ive got to ask you if you dont mind
4086132 but matron wont be happy about you visiting the secure wing its very irregular she likes to keep a firm grip on it itll take a while to sort a visit out and if any of them get wind
4086133 well then wed just better make it a surprise and the sooner we get it over with the sooner ill be out of your hair
4086134 they told me about the observation gallery would you mind showing me around
4086135 henry hello i want you to meet mr howard hes here to conduct a routine inspection hello henry
4086136 is this a bad time is there anything i can do to help
4086137 the sisters respond badly when inmates get upset follow my lead
4086138 doctor matron says the patient must go to bed you have con trol
4086139 mr howard would you mind standing with your back to the door and your head in front of that ah spy hole
4086140 andy wants me to go and conduct an unscheduled inspection of the funny farm
4086141 he seems to be afraid of something and theres some kind of complaint from one of the inmates
4086142 something about one of the long stay inmates and i was just wondering do you know anything about them
4086143 i had the privilege of working with them hmm let me see
4086144 i think youd better read this first then go and do what andy wants
4086145 be a good boy and copy me on your detailed itinerary before you depart
4086146 i suggest you read and memorize this booklet bob it is not impossible that there will be an exam and you really wouldnt want to fail it
4086147 its not true that the funny farm is entirely leak proof bob its surrounded by an air gap but it was designed to leak under certain very specific conditions i find it troubling that these conditions do not appear to apply in the present circumstances in addition to memorizing this document you might want to review the files on gibbous moon and axiom refuge before you go
4086148 and if you see cantor give my regards to the old coffin dodger im particularly interested in hearing what hes been up to for the past thirty years
4086149 lets see hes forty two married two kids he talks about them wifes a schoolteacher his deep cover is that he works in mi6 clerical
4086150 hes not field qualified mostly he does theory but he worked for q division and he was on secondment to the abstract attractor working group when he fell ill
4086151 hes convinced the auditors are after him for thinking inappropriate thoughts on organization time theres an elaborate confabulation and it looks a little like paranoid schizophrenia at first glance but underneath we sent him to our trust hospital for an mri scan and hes got the characteristic lesions
4086152 his prefrontal lobes look like swiss cheese its one of the early signs of krantzberg syndrome if we can keep him isolated from work for a couple more months then retire him to a nice quiet desk job we might be able to stabilize him k syndromes not like alzheimers if you remove the insult it frequently goes into remission mind you he may also need a course of chemotherapy at various times my predecessors tried electroconvulsive treatment prefrontal lobotomy neuroleptics daytime television lsd none of them work consistently or reliably the best treatment still seems to be bed rest followed by work therapy in a quiet undemanding office environment
4086153 it tends to hit theoretical computational demonologists after about twenty years merriweather is unusually young it also hits people whove worked in high thaum fields for too long initial symptoms include mild ataxia you saw his hand shaking and heightened affect it can be mistaken for bipolar disorder or hyperactivity theres also the disordered thinking and auditory hallucinations typical of some types of schizophrenia
4086154 there are two schools of thought if you leave out the malleus maleficarum stuff about souls contaminated by demonic effusions one is that exposure to high thaum fields cause progressive brain lesions
4086155 computational demonology you carry out calculations you prove theorems somewhere else in the platonic realm of mathematics listeners notice your activities and respond yes well theres some disagreement over this but the current orthodoxy in neurophysiology is that the human brain is a computational organ we can carry out computational tasks yes were not very good at it and at an individual neurological level theres no mechanism that might invoke the core turing theorems but if you think too hard about certain problems you might run the risk of carrying out a minor summoning in your own head nothing big enough or bad enough to get out but those florid daydreams and the sick feeling afterwards because you cant quite remember what it was about something in another universe just sucked a microscopic lump of neural tissue right out of your intraparietal sulcus and it wont grow back
4086156 matron i am taking the inspector to see the observation gallery in accordance with orders from head office he will then meet with the inmates in ward two we may be some time
4086157 its vital to keep matron informed of our movements otherwise she might mistake them for an escape attempt and take appropriate action
4086158 once in a while a temporary patient gets stir crazy
4086159 there are a couple of things to bear in mind firstly the nurses cant guarantee your safety if you get in trouble with the prisoners youre on your own secondly the gallery is a faraday cage and its thaumaturgically grounded take a black mass and a multiple sacrifice to get anything going in here you can observe the apartments via the periscopes and hearing tubes provided thats our preferred way you can go into the ward by proceeding to the other end of the gallery but id be very grateful if you could refrain from doing so unless its absolutely essential theyre difficult enough to manage as it is finally if you insist on meeting them just try to remember that appearances can be deceptive
4086160 just extremely dangerous and not in a hannibal lecter bite your throat out sense they the long term regular krantzberg syndrome cases theyre stable and communicative but youll see for yourself
4086161 how do i get into the ward proper and how do i leave
4086162 you go down the stairs at the far end of the gallery
4086163 this is room two its currently occupied by alan turing
4086164 the real alan turing would be nearly a hundred by now all our long term residents are named for famous mathematicians weve got alan turing kurt godel georg cantor and benoit mandelbrot turings the oldest benny is the most recent he actually has a payroll number 16
4086165 its one of the safe games no dice no need for a pencil and paper and it seems to be helpful why
4086166 the two players guy like a tortoise and another with a white beard and a full head of hair they are
4086167 thatd be turing and cantor turing used to be a detached special secretary in ops i think were not sure who or what cantor was but he was someone senior
4086168 they play chess every afternoon for a couple of hours for as long as i can remember
4086169 julius i think hes in an off site meeting or something today
4086170 every afternoon for a couple of hours julius says theyve been doing it for as long as he can remember it seems to be good for them
4086171 i need to go and talk to the patients now in person
4086172 stick around for fifteen minutes please in case i need to leave in a hurry otherwise
4086173 its twenty past one check back for me every hour on the half hour
4086174 and you do it on your own with dr hexenhammer up here to let you out if theres a problem and the sisters
4086175 well there arent any computers except matron down there are there
4086176 thats the alarm if you want a sister pull the chain with the blue handle if you want a general alarm which will call the duty psychiatrist pull the red handle there are alarm handles in every room
4086177 the staff have names for you all turing cantor mandelbrot and godel youre not cantor or turing that makes you one of mandelbrot or godel
4086178 and in any case we havent been formerly introduced so you might as well call me alice
4086179 well alice isnt this quite some rabbit hole youve fallen down
4086180 so now that weve established the preliminaries why dont we cut the bullshit
4086181 i suppose the board of directors want a progress report
4086182 its been years since they last sent someone to spy on us
4086183 i was only asking because alan and georg are still playing
4086184 were alone except from dr renfield upstairs and i dont think shes paying as much attention to whats going on down here as she ought to
4086185 in fact shes not really one of us at all is she shes a shrink who specializes in k syndrome and none of you are suffering from k syndrome so what are you doing in here
4086186 one of you wrote a letter alleging mistreatment by the staff it landed on my bosss desk and he sent me to find out why
4086187 ive met someone with k syndrome and i shared a house with some real lunatics once
4086188 everyone elses health tell me do they still keep an ibm 1602 in the back of the steam ironing room
4086189 oh dear times change i suppose look bob or whoever you call yourself we belong here maybe we didnt when we first checked in for the weekend seminar but weve lived here so long that youve heard of care in the community this is our community and we will be very annoyed with you if you try to make us leave
4086190 what makes you think im going to try and make you leave
4086191 we havent finished yet but theyre selling off all the hospital trusts property
4086192 what about st hildas it was requisitioned from the st james charitable foundation back in 1943 and for the past ten years the ministry of defence been giving all those old wartime properties back to their owners to sell off to the developers what about us
4086193 its a conspiracy hes from human resources they sent him to evaluate us
4086194 let me get this straight mandelbrot you checked in thirty years ago for a weekend seminar and they put you in the secure ward godel im not from hr im from ops you must be cantor right angleton sends his regards
4086195 angleton the skinny young still warming a chair is he
4086196 hes my boss and i want to know the rules of that game you were just playing with turing
4086197 he could be from the opposition kgb department 16 or gru maybe
4086198 the hospital theres no electricity no electronics no way to get a signal out but it works both ways youre inside the biggest damn grounded defensive pentacle this side of hq and anything on the
4086199 because youre acting cagey lad which makes you too bright for your own good listen to me just try to convince yourself that were playing chess and matron will let you out of here
4086200 alan be a good lad and try to jam the door for a minute will you bob you are not cleared for what were doing here but you can tell angleton that our full report to the board should be ready in another eighteen months
4086201 are you absolutely sure theyre not going to sell st hildas off to build flats for yuppies
4086202 get me out of here and ill make damned sure they dont sell anything off
4086203 youre sure none of you submitted a complaint about staff brutality
4086204 youd better run along it sounds as if matron is having second thoughts about you
4086205 intru der escape attempt all patients must go to their go to their go to their bedrooms immediately
4086206 you are not in receipt of a valid section two three four or 136 order subject to the mental health act and youre bloody well not getting a 5 2 or 5 4 out of me either
4086207 when he re turns to sign the pa pers doc tor renfield has prepared we will have you
4086208 you cant make me consent and lobotomy requires the patients consent in this country so why bother
4086209 the sec ure ward in mates are under my care i am re quired to care for them the short stay in mates are use less you will be use full

4086228 i understand they have put puryear in the controversial category
4086229 its very rare for a district court nominee to become controversial usually they just fly through
4086230 groups can attack a nominee but youll never see the nominee respond to anything except at hearings
4086231 as far as his qualifications go he was at the top of his class in law school he clerked on the u s court of appeals he has legislative experience in the u s senate he manages litigation for a big fortune 500 company and the aba american bar association rated him as qualified
4086232 at the end of the session its who wants a bridge in vermont
4086233 im glad the judiciary committee is taking a closer look at mr puryear as a candidate because the issues we raised are legitimate issues
4086234 this is the stuff we use after we take showers so when you take your showers you can use all this stuff by yourself

4086245 this is a watershed moment for our city as a sports destination
4086246 we were confident that we submitted a very competitive bid
4086247 if i could get that right hand free then i could get on him before he got his hands on me
4086248 i never snapped with the left hand before i had to
4086249 its almost not a factor who starts the game we rotate so much it almost doesnt matter
4086250 i want to be the starter and a guy that the coaches can depend on
4086251 it was a battle a battle for a long time and it was something i had to come to terms with
4086252 during the whole process when they were recruiting me they were telling me the team really needs a fullback
4086253 it just kept getting louder until finally one day they asked me to make the switch
4086254 but just being a competitor i didnt want to get blown up and have the coaches mad at me and have everybody laughing at me in the locker room
4086255 so i just got out there and did well enough where they obviously felt like they needed me over there
4086256 hes a physical guy a strong guy when you see curtis he is going to bring the thunder hes going to try to knock your head off
4086257 i have thought about that and ive also thought about winning the national championship
4086258 the biggest thing that made me want to do it was when beanie came to me and said he was really enjoying running behind me it made me like i was doing something
4086259 a meeting in australia in june 2008 resolved that selco would be granted approval to proceed if oceanlinx could not raise the required funding by the end of august
4086260 we didnt quite have the status that football did but we were the next sport
4086261 he used to say you have to get the horses to win so he recruited from around the world
4086262 i didnt go to bed until about 1 a m i just cant get away from it
4086263 not many get to ex perience the olympic games even going and not competing was quite an experience for the athletes
4086264 we were like the football team in that we all worked together
4086265 this is a young group but definitely just as talented we are just trying to work to learn one another this is only the second year that these guys have been in this offense
4086266 we acquired a talented player about to hit his prime
4086267 he can set things up for himself as well as for other people
4086268 it was good for him to get in with the rest of the football team and kind of immerse himself with the team
4086269 and hes always raring to go the biggest challenge now is to ease him back slowly and dont allow him to do more than he can
4086270 when youve been away from it and playing the real game its different than the rehab
4086271 time is going to tell well make the decision based on consistency over time
4086272 im excited as i can be to see andre and jerome marcus maxwell and chatman and glenn holt and not everybodys going to make it
4086273 we may be in more formations without three wide receivers
4086274 it shocked me i didnt know a couple of guys told me
4086275 its sad i thought for sure brett would retire with the packers you go back to how ended his career
4086276 would you ever want to see quarterback john elway with anybody but denver
4086277 i think brett made his decision to retire a little early in the offseason he probably should have waited
4086278 its kind of a fantastic thing im just as excited as i was the first one
4086279 im grateful to sam wyche who brought me to cincinnati and the brown family and all the other coaches i have worked for its been an honor and a pleasure to work for everyone
4086280 you no longer see marvin lewis coaching every position on defense
4086281 he kind of set the pace involved in the program so he is seeing kind of that reward now
4086282 the fact im healthier now is awesome im feeling good i feel great to be back with the team
4086283 guys had time to heal in the offseason and we did as much as we possibly could to get healthy and it shows
4086284 theyre trying to apply the same rules they used when the number of journalists covering their companies was a manageable chummy lot today theres a whole spectrum of people writing about startups in big media publications large and small blogs twitter friendfeed and everything in between most pr folks dont read blogs and certainly dont understand them some bloggers really cultivate pr relationships but for me pr is the last refuge when im attacking a story they keep trying to put out the fires im starting

4086288 today were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
4086289 our arguments about the need for a permanent presence of us troops and missiles on polish soil have been taken seriously by the american side
4086290 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
4086291 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want were not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
4086292 these installations only worsen the situation we will be forced to respond to this adequately the eu and us have been warned
4086293 one battery is just the start once its based permanently in poland that would enable the launch of a modernisation programme which by 2018 would provide a complete anti missile defence system
4086294 were also counting on the fact that getting patriots would allow us discounts on other batteries and open the road to a more modern air defence system like the thaad
4086295 we must be psychologically and tactically prepared for every opponent in the semi finals

4086310 there is a danger that if there is not investment in transport homes for people and more places for businesses to easily and simply conduct their r amp d then we may see the economy not getting past this current financial instability so easily
4086311 we are proud to be recognized as a business intelligence leader by forrester based both on our current offerings and on our strategy and market presence
4086312 under ibm cognos remains the only truly erp independent performance management solution
4086313 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4086314 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4086315 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4086316 every episode runs a steep cost of more than a crore and the ratings are nothing to write home about the channel is not making the right noises and ekta kapoor will not budge from her stance
4086317 things havent been smooth with peter mukherjea and ekta kapoor and finally the channel decided to take a call and close its mythology kitty with balaji productions home showcase
4086318 they made big promises but the promises like their showcase was made in haste where does that leave the show
4086319 i am late but my results are going to be truly noteworthy i am not rushed and finally that shows in the quality of production i appreciate the channel for taking a stance and not pushing there is quality in what we stand for and at the end of the day it reflects on the ratings
4086320 hes not from another planet hes from the future his father made him and then made a time machine sixty years from now he is an average swimmer but he has come back here to mop up
4086321 i think years and years down the road well realize more and more how amazing and special he is
4086322 and now to be the most decorated olympian of all time it just sounds weird saying it im speechless
4086323 when i started thinking about it being at the top with so many great athletes who have walked in these olympics games thats when i started tearing up its a pretty amazing feeling
4086324 when most people dont feel well they dont swim well
4086325 it sort of has the feel of a golf tournament when tiger chooses not to play doesnt it
4086326 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4086327 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4086328 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4086329 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4086330 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4086331 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4086332 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4086333 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4086334 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4086335 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4086336 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4086337 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4086338 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4086339 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4086340 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4086341 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4086342 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4086343 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4086344 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4086345 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4086346 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4086347 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4086348 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4086349 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4086350 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4086351 we have been reviewing prices daily and despite a steady fall in the kiwi dollar over the last week we have seen enough drop in the price of crude to be able to pass on these savings to kiwi motorists

4086354 who could have sex the longest i think thats an event i can do well in
4086355 and probably who could stay up the longest just so you know thats supposed to be funny even though i am serious
4086356 there was this young lady recently that i invited to a party but it was a party with just me and her you know what im saying
4086357 its a huge situation for me after 35 years because ive wanted to bring one back
4086358 this whole thing unfolded about two weeks ago when these two boys came on a talk show here in the states and announced theyd found a bigfoot body
4086359 the commentator asked them if they could send someone to see the body and they said the only person we would allow to come down and verify the body is the real bigfoot hunter tom biscardi
4086360 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
4086361 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4086362 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
4086363 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
4086364 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
4086365 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
4086366 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues
4086367 i think now i have to play hockey and later talk about things like that i think it a good opportunity but now its not important for me for now
4086368 the most important thing for me is playing hockey and because i am playing hockey i got the opportunity to go on playboy otherwise i wouldnt i have no plans on a career in modelling
4086369 for me it was a good opportunity and maybe when i look back after a few years i will be proud of it not everybody can go on the cover of playboy
4086370 i did it because i am confident of my body and myself
4086371 it wasnt a group decision we havent seen each other the shooting was separate everyone decided it for themselves
4086372 as a result of preliminary investigations we have suspended four students and those students will remain suspended until we have further details from the police
4086373 that anyone could come into the school after hours and take advantage of defenceless animals that have been lovingly cared for by our students is disappointing
4086374 there will be consequences for the students according to their level of involvement
4086375 the college has put procedures in place to manage the wellbeing of all students

4086377 this particular theater employs a person with disabilities its not about the theater its about the movie
4086378 it is so rude to show it in the theaters
4086379 no matter the intention it is unacceptable and extremely hurtful for a majority group to freely make jokes about a minority group reinforcing the prejudice and discrimination that people with developmental disabilities have been fighting for generations
4086380 its downright mean and dehumanizing its horrific they dont deserve to be treated that way
4086381 people with cognitive and developmental disabilities are our family members our friends our neighbors and our co workers
4086382 they do not deserve to be ridiculed to get a laugh in a movie
4086383 if i saw that depiction i would leave the movie

4086390 they showed me the body they took me to the area where they found it it took a day and a half to get there
4086391 i got to be honest when i first saw it i hated to see it in that state it was in i wanted to capture one so the world could see it walking i guess this is the next best thing for the time being
4086392 we trekked in for a day a half what kind of lunatic would be out here in a monkey suit i saw the thing i touched it
4086393 theyre fine guys one works for the police department in georgia and the other was a correctional officer theyre pretty credible guys
4086394 well release the dna analysis and well have the body right next to the two boys then you can see its real that its not all bullshit
4086395 as long as his part time business doesnt affect his work ethic
4086396 his claims of finding bigfoot is entirely a different matter unfortunately thats spilling over into his police life and thats where we have concerns when he comes back from medical leave well have to sit down and address those issues
4086397 its better to be there in the outside lane than not to be there at all
4086398 its always nice to win them all on the way through and tick every box along the way
4086399 perhaps we havent ticked every box so far and we definitely wont be going out as favourites but thats fine by me
4086400 if i can race like that the way i was feeling this morning then the final should be a breeze really
4086401 i was absolutely ecstatic i couldnt quite believe i was out there challenging ondrej synek hes one of the danger men and i led him for a lot of the race so there are positives
4086402 people are fighting for their lives and semifinals are horrible places to be really youve got everything to lose and nothing really to gain
4086403 im going to struggle to see everyone else but theyre going to struggle to see me hopefully i can get the slip on the field and they wont know what im up to but if youre fighting it out at the finish you might not be quite in touch with what everyone else is doing
4086404 theres six quality boats out there and thats the way its always going to be in an olympic final you definitely wouldnt write off anyone thats come from anywhere were happy to be there and its going to be a very close race come saturday
4086405 i guess i have to let you go for a break now huh

4086417 i remember that we missed a ton of free throws 14 of their 34

4086437 it turns out that in the photo shoot for the submission of our team one of our sponsors asked us to make as a wink to our participation in beijing an expression of eastern eyes we felt it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as an affectionate gesture

4086439 it deals with something current but something that a lot of people in this country dont know a lot about
4086440 its nice when you get a book which makes you think about issues in the real world rather than just in the book you hear a lot about afghanistan and its interesting to see things from the perspective of someone whos lived there even though terrible things happen in the book it shows you afghanistan as a country the narrator is proud of living in
4086441 we are bombarded in the news with afghanistan so to be taken by the hand into that country and to meet the people through the joy of reading a novel is a really remarkable thing chimamanda ngozi adichies half of a yellow sun does that too you feel youve been absolutely changed that your understanding of the world has been significantly enhanced and not through reading a dry history book theres a huge appetite for that and i think khaled is the strongest at providing it
4086442 the writing of this book was a labour of love for me i grew quite attached to the characters and came to care for them in a most personal way

4086489 we have achieved measurable success in many regards we have also faced a number of challenges including the issues with our initial business arrangement in cambodia while we are disappointed with our early earnings results this year we believe that we have identifiedour challenges and are implementing solutions that will make us a very strong company going forward in fact these initiatives have already shown very strong improvements in q3 we are learning improving and remaining firmly committed to capitalizing on the tremendous growth opportunities ahead of us
4086490 while mindful of supporting growth during these critical early stages of our business we believe we can implement cost reductions and reduce cash expenses we are also actively seeking strategic alternatives for our table game business

4086492 we have also renegotiated all of our contracts in cambodia and have materially increased our revenue sharing in this market we continue to re evaluate underperforming venues an if necessary we will re deploy the machines to a venue that can provide a venue where a more appropriate return can be achieved
4086493 the company continues to look to add new venues to our contract pipeline our primary focus remains on quality and not quantity we believe the new agreements that we have are for high value and high return locations this approach will insure that we develop a strong base of attractive and sustainable venues from which we can continue to grow our business we expect to end the year with 14 18 venues in operation we are also actively reviewing several other exciting opportunities we project that the company will turn ebitda positive in the second half of 2009

4086531 weve struggled in team sports for a long time for one or two of our teams to win here would be fantastic you can see that all of our athletes are very much following those teams

4086593 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4086594 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4086595 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4086596 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4086597 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4086598 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4086599 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4086600 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4086601 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4086602 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4086605 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4086606 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4086607 eso de am rica latina nos lo impusieron cada d a yo hablo menos de hispanoam rica de latinoam rica indoam rica afroam rica eso es lo que somos nosotros
4086608 para m lo que impuso el nombre de am rica latina fue un fen meno eminentemente cultural
4086609 en hispanoam rica se afrancesaron mucho los procesos culturales los grandes artistas e intelectuales iban a par s a estudiar
4086610 hablar de indoam rica es un absurdo no podemos regresar a lo que no somos
4086611 lo primero es que somos un continente multirracial y policultural de ah que a lo largo de este libro no se emplee la denominaci n am rica latina inventada por los franceses en el siglo xix para incluirse en el conjunto americano sino la descripci n m s completa indo afro ibero am rica

4086613 de friesland draagt de sport en ook de gehandicaptensport een warm hart toe toen het foppe fonds ons vroeg of wij bij de inkoop van speciale elektrische rolstoelen wilden bemiddelen hebben we meteen ja gezegd doordat wij via onze afdeling zorginkoop goede contacten met leveranciers onderhouden zijn we er in geslaagd om de rolstoelen tegen een zeer scherpe prijs in te kopen maar wat belangrijker is ook voor de toekomst ligt er tussen het foppe fonds en de leveranciers van rolstoelen een stevig fundament we hopen dan ook dat dit niet bij een eenmalige actie blijft maar dat hier een basis voor de toekomst ligt zodat nog meer mensen met een lichamelijke beperking kunnen sporten als betrokken zorgverzekeraar zijn we er trots op daar een rol bij te kunnen spelen
4086614 ik heb altijd gevonden dat iedereen een kans moet krijgen zo menswaardig mogelijk te leven maar sommige kinderen worden spijtig genoeg belemmerd in hun ontwikkelingen door omstandigheden volgens mij is daar altijd iets aan te doen

4086619 estamos tratando de establecer cuales fueron los ultimos movimientos de los tres y qu cosas en com n pod an llegar a tener porque s lo sabemos que estaban emprendiendo un nuevo negocio
4086620 sabemos que no es un tema de venganza estoy seguro que no es por un tema comercial que no es por una deuda entendemos que hay algo que uni a los tres y no sabemos qu es
4086621 i am very pleased with our q2 2008 financial results
4086622 we are experiencing substantial growth in the number of affinity groups and other business partners through which we are selling both our carexpress health discount programs and our carexpress plus membership programs we have successfully completed the planned transition of our primary source of sales from marketing companies to affinity groups and are now beginning to reap the rewards of our hard work it is very gratifying to know that so many large membership organizations located across the country are expressing such a tremendous interest in our programs
4086623 i am also pleased with our financial results for q2 2008
4086624 our revenue increased almost 10 between q1 2008 and q2 2008 and our gross profit from operations increased 83 between q1 2008 and q2 2008 the substantial increase in our gross profit was a direct result of the cost savings that we achieved from our decision to shift our primary source of sales from marketing companies to affinity groups these costs savings also reflected themselves in our bottom line which improved substantially between q1 2008 and q2 2008 our net loss per share deceased 50 from 0 02 to 0 01 as the company achieved its smallest net loss from operations in its history
4086625 we recently announced relationships with two groups the polish national alliance and a 5 000 member union that will represent the greatest driving forces behind our revenue growth during the second half of 2008
4086626 purchases of our carexpress membership programs by members of affinity groups located throughout the country will be the primary driver for revenue positive cash flow and profitability going forward our q2 2008 net loss of 381 002 was the smallest loss in our companys history and this achievement is even more impressive when you take into consideration that 221 794 of the net loss was for non cash expenses we are very excited about what the remainder of 2008 has in store for national health partners
4086627 bryanna and katherine thank you so much i was so worried after my dad died because i didnt know if i would be able to go to school anymore i really wanted to keep learning but i didnt know if i could but because of you i am able to keep getting an education and working towards my future goals at university you saved my life
4086628 how would this scholarship help your family and your life
4086629 remember me the way i was and love me the way i am
4086630 i wanted to ask about the new software package from averon
4086631 three sols from the augarian army requested it last week said theyd be back in here tomorrow get the picture techy
4086632 the key debate for those who teach a level students and undergraduates is whether the pressure on teachers and lecturers to spoon feed a level students through exams means students fail to develop the desire to continue learning and the skills to learn independently
4086633 we urge the government to completely rethink the current targets regime as well as the curriculum and the current post 16 exams to make schooling more relevant so students leave school with the skills they need and a hunger to learn
4086634 i look at the stadium here and i think i would love to be here
4086635 they built the stadium themselves they had no government or local council help the club took it on themselves borrowed the money and built it and their club made a profit last year i dont know if you can do that in dublin or cork or drogheda
4086636 they have 100 000 people in the city here they get average gates of 10 000 12 000 for the big games they get 17 000 they get 12 per cent of the citys population at their home games we cant get 12 per cent of people from ballyfermot
4086637 so how do you market it and sell it you do it by getting good stadiums elfsborgs stadium is good theres car parking its comfortable
4086638 there has been a lot of negativity around the league in the last while and some of its true you cant hide everything the dressing rooms at dalymount park now are the same as when i played there in the 90s it hasnt moved on
4086639 i think we have a chance of scoring i really do our away form has been better all season we must take confidence from the drogheda situation the way drogheda went to dynamo kiev and got a draw dynamo kiev must be a better side than these elfsborg so whether you get luck or you do really well you have a chance
4086640 im sure the pitch will be an issue as elfsborg are used to it the speed of it they know their pitch well
4086641 they are a decent side they have only conceded one goal at home and five goals in 23 games overall
4086642 it will be difficult elfsborg work very hard to get their defensive shape very quickly odense who beat us 5 0 in the uefa cup last year are a better team than elfsborg
4086643 they are a decent team and they will come at us from the tip off in one of their matches against hibs in the intertoto cup they went at them from the tip off it was like a charge in a rugby match they just pumped it into the box
4086644 but we know thats coming the players are prepared for it its just a matter of whether they can withstand it early on and try to exploit the areas where we can get at them it wont be a slow game they will go for the jugular
4086645 john murphy hasnt got full match fitness but we will probably end up starting him if he plays there will be a worry over his fitness but we dont have much else
4086646 as children age direct caretaking and influence diminish and children are often seen by their parents as peers with whom they are have continuing relationships
4086647 although our results suggest these patterns of change and continuity differ by parent and child gender our analyses suggest important similarities among mothers and fathers within the same family
4086648 the analysis suggests that mothers and fathers in the same families in our study rarely reported divergent experiences with their young adult sons and daughters
4086649 overwhelmingly the examination of mothers and fathers responses revealed similarities in their experiences as parents to their young adult children
4086650 we are very pleased that our cash generation has enabled us to increase shareholder returns through the dividend payout the corporation has raised its dividend each year since paying its first dividend in 1994 in addition to the dividend payout the corporation has made continued investment in internal growth opportunities and value added business development opportunities to enhance long term shareholder return
4086651 in theory minimum wages threaten employment in the low income sector yet there is hardly any practical evidence to confirm such a phenomenon
4086652 companies can often balance out the increase in labour costs with increased productivity
4086653 the conventional contrast between low wages and high employment in the u s versus higher wages and low employment in europe is not nearly as clear as expected
4086654 every country will profit from the growth of the global economy
4086655 workers in that sector are part of service industries that are not competing internationally
4086656 were expecting a fascinating discussion that will provide us with a wealth of new insights
4086657 science lives from dialogue the conferences provide young scientists from all over the world the opportunity to deepen their knowledge of relevant issues in their fields of expertise with the respective experts

4086660 today no one has locked up the really good ideas to stay competitive the technology industry has to have internal and external innovation paths
4086661 industry academia collaboration is an open innovation example that can provide competitive advantage to companies that know how to leverage the enormous creative potential of university researchers
4086662 deepening hp labs strategic collaboration with those in academia government and the commercial sector ensures hps research endeavors result in high impact research that meets the scientific and business objectives of hp and its partners
4086663 the professors deep technical expertise hp labs researchers domain and industry knowledge and governments abilities to fund innovative research will come together to address the worlds most complex it challenges
4086664 the symbol change increases visibility for shareholders and supports the companys marketing plan focused on branding dollars4gold com nationally

4086666 no me gusta jugar al patad n y por eso hemos fichado talento
4086667 el que venga a ver el elche el a o que viene no va a salir defraudado porque no me gusta jugar al patad n y por eso hemos fichado a gente con talento los jugadores que manejamos para que vengan a reforzar a la delantera son fant sticos
4086668 este a o haremos muchos goles porque tenemos gente con mucha llegada por las bandas llevamos muchos tiempo sin ver jugadores as de r pidos en los extremos son jugadores a la vieja usanza
4086669 es un jugador vivo letal agresivo y tiene mucha t cnica es un matador dentro del rea he hablado con l y le he dicho que el elche va a ser un trampol n para que el a o que viene pueda volver al betis por la puerta grande pero para eso tiene que jugar 30 partidos como m nimo y marcar muchos goles
4086670 no podemos asegurar nada porque el f tbol es un juego s pienso que el entusiasmo y las ganas de cada uno de los jugadores dan capacidad al sevilla para disputar la victoria en cada partido
4086671 es importante que haya buena sinton a entre todos porque hay una temporada muy larga y en baches o momentos menos acertados la uni n y el compromiso evitan malos momentos
4086672 intentaremos ganar el carranza pero hay que jugarlo primero ante un rival que consideramos directo en nuestro objetivo y vamos a c diz con la intenci n de seguir progresando en la pretemporada ganarlo ser a bonito y atractivo para el club

4086680 neighborhoods should be kept in the drivers seat of upcoming neighborhood plan updates
4086681 the republican brand isnt very popular these days so they want to do away with branding

4086684 were opposed to a jail being in any area of seattle where its illegal according to land use codes the only legal location is downtown
4086685 to cooperate and negotiate in good faith with the county to expand the regional justice center in kent if not there it should go in one of the east or north side communities that are potentially partnering with seattle
4086686 the jail is going to be one of the most challenging issues were going to have to deal with and the only reason were dealing with it is because king county is in a financial hole we have told the potential partners we wont join with them in building a semi regional jail unless they put sites on the table we know none of the current sites are great sites its a tough decision and were going to take a lot of time before we come to a decision
4086687 carols surgery was successful we are not out of the woods yet but signs look very positive
4086688 also wenn meine kinder bei mir sind dann stehe ich auf und mache pfannkuchen f r sie
4086689 ohne aber mit w rstchen danach gehen wir meist an die frische luft und machen einen spaziergang danach mache ich ganz gerne etwas sport mit ihnen wie zum beispiel schwimmen der mittagsschlaf ist etwa von 13 bis 15 uhr eingeplant und dann lese ich ihnen meist etwas vor
4086690 eine ausgabe der oder auch irgendwas wo autos drin vorkommen
4086691 spiele spielen wir eigentlich nicht wir lesen gerne in b chern oder malen und basteln und sie sind viel drau en mit ihren kleinen autos
4086692 sie springen beide eigentlich nur ins wasser ok jj tut es nur fast preston h pft schon hinein und jj denkt dass er es auch kann aber dann springt er auf mich zu und sagt die ganze zeit mommy mommy mommy
4086693 preston schon er mag sein shirt und seine schuhe er sagt mir immer was er anziehen m chte
4086694 ich m chte eine ganz traditionelle party veranstalten eine f r sie gemeinsam ich habe ein paar freunde die auch kinder haben und die werde ich einladen wir werden wohl etwa 15 bis 20 leute sein es wird z b selbst gemachte eiscreme geben wahrscheinlich wird mein dad das bernehmen wir werden auch eine h pfburg aufstellen
4086695 wenn sie es tun m chten und das talent dazu haben werde ich sie unterst tzen aber das interesse daf r sollen sie selbst entdecken
4086696 nein das w rde ich besser nicht aber ich w rde sie dennoch bedingungslos lieben wenn sie im showbuiz arbeiten wollten ich m chte nur dass sie eine normale kindheit haben so gut es unter diesen umst nden eben geht
4086697 ich liebe reis und brath hnchen das kochen wir gemeinsam au erdem lieben die kids meine spagetti ich glaube aus irgendeinem grund m gen sie meine spagetti lieber als das was sie bei ihrem dad bekommen
4086698 ich glaube es ist meine so e ich mache sie mit liebe und aus frischen zutaten
4086699 ich kann mein geheimnis nicht verraten ich sage nur soviel dass ich daf r fast eine stunde brauche
4086700 eigentlich berhaupt nicht ich bin viel zu besch ftigt und wenn die kinder hier sind m chte ich dass wir an die frische luft gehen oder ich lese ihnen vor
4086701 nein ich schaue einfach kein tv ab und zu holen wir uns ein paar filme
4086702 ja schon als kleines m dchen ich wurde von meiner mutter so erzogen dass man das haus st ndig sauber halten muss
4086703 richtig richtig gut ich ging z b w hrend meiner zeit auf der high school durch eine phase in der sie nicht so gut war aber jetzt bin ich an einem punkt angelangt wo ich sie wieder viel mehr sch tze
4086704 das war etwas ganz besonderes und zugleich total seltsam weil sie immer das baby der familie war und jetzt bekam das baby ein baby das war der wahnsinn ich war etwas geschockt aber es war dann sehr cool und sie war gl cklich als sie ins krankenhaus kam dachten wir alle dass es den ganzen tag dauern w rde aber dann ging alles ganz schnell und das baby flutschte f rmlich raus und jetzt sind wir alle gl cklich
4086705 sie wird zum geburtstag der kinder hierher kommen sie werden dann zum ersten mal ihre cousine sehen ich bin mir sicher dass die jungs wie gro e br der zu maddie sein werden
4086706 noch nie soviel ich schreibe jeden tag genau hier am klavier in diesem zimmer
4086707 wegen der harten arbeit die reingesteckt wird w rde ich sagen
4086708 absolut der imagefaktor ist ja auch schon etwas lter die dazugeh rigen videos werden ganz anders sein
4086709 das w rde ich gerne insofern ich den geeigneten film finde
4086710 an und f r sich schon wir versuchen es zwischen meinen terminplan und die kinder einzuf gen
4086711 wenn ich das richtige team dabei um mich h tte absolut wir halten ausschau danach es k nnte sogar etwas werden zuerst wahrscheinlich damenkleidung sp ter kindermode
4086712 ich m chte noch viele geniale alben machen und auch ein paar gro artige filmrollen annehmen
4086713 ich bin gesund gl cklich und freue mich auf die zukunft
4086714 wenn sie das wollten w rde ich sie nat rlich trotzdem bedingungslos lieben ich m chte allerdings dass sie wenigstens eine normale kindheit haben so gut es unter diesen umst nden geht
4086715 ich war schon ein wenig geschockt sie ist immer das baby der familie gewesen und pl tzlich bekam das baby selbst ein baby es war der wahnsinnn
4086716 ich bin mir sicher dass die jungs f r maddie wie gro e br der sein werden
4086717 gott hat die macht etwas schlimmes zuzulassen und es dann in gutes umzukehren wenn das alles nicht passiert w re w re es f r mich niemals m glich gewesen mich meiner tochter wieder anzun hern und die beziehung aufzubauen die ich jetzt zu diesen zwei kleinen jungs habe
4086718 vou marcar dois gols contra os brasileiros um n o o suficiente
4086719 acho que o brasil joga mais tecnicamente n s jogamos mais fisicamente somos mais fortes acho que isso pode ser importante
4086720 n o existe medo vamos jogar para cima do brasil n o vamos nos defender evolu mos muito tecnicamente nos ltimos anos e confiamos no nosso potencial poss vel derrotar o brasil
4086721 dass ihr handeln uns beeinflussen wird als welt b rger kunde mitarbeiter patient als mensch
4086722 ter ido mais longe nessa olimp ada resultado do trabalho que a comiss o t cnica da confedera o desenvolveu comigo e com as outras atletas
4086723 fico triste por n o ter executado o melhor de mim nessa ltima luta
4086724 esse resultado n o foi suficiente para poder brindar o trabalho que eu fiz junto com a confedera o
4086725 uma pena aproveito e pe o desculpa para toda a comiss o t cnica da confedera o que acreditou em mim at hoje
4086726 eu n o estou nem pensando na pr xima agora
4086727 enquanto eu tiver motiva o e enquanto as atletas do brasil tiverem dando oportunidade de eu estar na sele o com certeza vou continuar
4086728 mi sono svegliata tu non ti sveglierai continuo a chiedermi perch non posso accettarlo non era una finzione successo davvero che te ne sei andato
4086729 io non ti dimentichero mai non smettero mai di ringraziarti per le cose che hai fatto per me
4086730 ele passou um momento muito particular mas quando a torcida canta seu nome ele se esquece de tudo o que aconteceu sempre disse que precisamos dele ele importante para o time e demonstrou isso
4086731 o fato de s o paulo assumir uma pol tica do clima pode ser um exemplo para outras capitais do pa s

4086734 i think over the next few days the biggest thing is going to be trying to get as much rest as i can if i can do that ill be fine
4086735 for us to break the record by so far is amazing i really look forward to sitting back and cheering for the aussies
4086736 i did my best and ran out of room at the end
4086737 im a little bit tired and i have a full day to recover
4086738 i cant believe it after the relay i could have sunk but i told myself that after all these years of hard work i cant let myself go down my legs were shaking at the start i was really tense just like the other seven guys
4086739 to bounce back from that relay takes a lot of guts and he showed that today
4086740 full credit to him he swam a better race and the better man won on the day
4086741 the most important thing is being able to separate the two events and just move on ive trained for it im used to it the biggest part for me in the psychological part
4086742 its a new generation and its now time to step aside they did a great job im from the previous generation
4086743 i was so calm that i think i could have seen each face in this venue
4086744 so to go out there and accomplish a medal is really exciting it doesnt top the relay medal but its something ive been pushing for for four years
4086745 faltou empenho independentemente da equipe que vai jogar os jogadores precisam ter determina o o atleta precisa sempre dar o m ximo o comportamento da equipe foi muito ruim
4086746 existe uma proposta concreta pelo jogador ent o precisamos estar preparados para encontrar um substituto
4086747 sempre que realizamos uma atividade pol tica inserida na nossa campanha eleitoral surgem indiv duos ligados ao partido no poder com aparelhos de som ensurdecedor impedindo a nossa atividade fato que corresponde a uma atitude de intoler ncia e falta de cultura democr tica
4086748 ter o sido os aparelhos de som de alta pot ncia do mpla a afastar as pessoas
4086749 estamos a dar continuidade ao nosso programa de contato com o povo
4086750 al m do contato porta a porta e outras atividades em c rculos mais restritos
4086751 a imprensa tamb m n o tem ajudado muito no trabalho do partido privilegiando o partido da situa o que surge sempre com destaque perante as demais for as pol ticas
4086752 para n s o balan o positivo mas no final da semana vamos parar para definirmos outros objetivos da campanha incidiremos as nossas a es nas reas de influ ncia dos maiores partidos
4086753 it is with deep regret that the stafford motor speedway announces that during a practice session of the ama xtrm sanctioned supermoto event being held today rider anthony hart age 21 of henderson nevada succumbed to injuries received while participating in the event
4086754 he never really had any kind of focus until he got involved with supermoto and the last eight months hes been just dedicated himself to riding and racing and training and everyone around him from his family to his friends have never seen him so dedicated with his training and riding
4086755 he really really really enjoyed what he did he stayed in my room last night and we stayed up until four oclock in the morning just talking about life and racing he had a lot of ambition and a lot of goals

4086761 en medio del vaiven el tren corta el espacio sobre sus vias deslizando colores sobre el paisaje sacudiendo poblados y ciudades pero cuando deje de pasar y de sosiego para siempre al esqueleteo de rieles y durmientes estas fotos seran un tesoro hoy por lo pronto son un gento vivo que permite imaginar
4086762 he certainly didnt like the color of his medal during the medal ceremony he took the bronze from around his neck and in disgust dropped it on the mat in protest as he walked away
4086763 im going to take a look at the video i know theres a couple things i can work on throughout semis and finals everyone is going to keep going faster

4086767 but if you dont believe youre going to swim fast and you can do it just dont come out and swim because youre not going to give yourself a chance
4086768 popovs world record stood unchallenged for nine years until 10 swimmers bettered it this year in an event where 22 seconds used to be fast enough for a medal
4086769 oh it got stuck behind a broken down train and has had to go back to paddington well see what happens
4086770 there is no reason that anyone should believe that just because they missed one payment on one credit card that any other credit card company they have has the right to raise their interest rate

4086786 i was surprised just as much as everybody else was
4086787 i talked to luda and he said it was time to sit down do business make grown man moves both of them got albums coming out time to try new things cris did something for t i too that nobody heard yet its about to come out soon its a good move
4086788 its showing that once great minds set their differences aside they can make something happen
4086789 thats two grown men not two grown males grown men
4086790 when we were recording at sound city studios i found it very easy to get drunk and stay there
4086791 i also found it easy to amuse my friends joshua any time hes down i just want to make him happy and nothing delights him more than seeing me on rollerblades one night i got sh faced and long story short when the head of sound city one of the pre eminent recording studios wakes you up at 7 in the morning in their upstairs parking lot and youre wearing nothing but a tank top cutoffs and rollerblades youve got f ing problems
4086792 i was rolling with a certain hollywood figure who may or may not have been aforementioned as a guest singer on this record and this tattoo artist i was rolling with in order to keep her in my life as my friend it meant the end of the potential for another aspect of our relationship so it was more of a disappointment
4086793 thats the worst kind of heartbreak in a way because it was the heartbreak of being an adult
4086794 i get off the phone with this girl and i said out loud f now im a f ing fool
4086795 i dont care what anybody says when youre hanging out with celebrities you never expect to get involved with them emotionally no matter how much you like them
4086796 this album is kind of i hate to sound corny but its kind of a mature look at hollywood
4086797 i fell in love with hollywood the city itself in a randy newman sort of way so i guess the album is about a variety of things di swinging in hollywood and acting tougher than you really might be
4086798 i really believe if you want to keep doing what were doing in this business youve got to grow
4086799 you have to go somewhere you have to be on a curve not on a line
4086800 not that its a good one but i have some sort of reputation and i could f that up doing the wrong thing thats suddenly a consideration thats never been present before thats going to affect everything the trick was learning how to give appropriate time to certain things but what im glad to see is really on this record its the same story two best friends having a sh s and giggles good time making rock and roll

4086803 cork city football club has been engaged in negotiations with potential new investors for the last number of weeks
4086804 it is too early to speculate on the outcome of these discussions which are still ongoing
4086805 the board of cork city football club will meet next week and come to a decision on the future of the club
4086806 some of the figures currently being reported today particularly in relation to the wages of players and staff are inaccurate and grossly inflated
4086807 because of the sensitive nature of the ongoing discussions it would be inappropriate for cork city football club to make any further comment at this time
4086808 the football association of ireland has been in regular contact with the arkaga fund and cork city investment fc ltd the company operating cork city football club in relation to financial difficulties facing the cork city football club
4086809 the fai has contacted the arkaga fund with regards to a written undertaking made by one of its companies to guarantee all liabilities arising from cork city investment fc ltd for a twelve month period from 29th january 2008 through to 29th january 2009
4086810 it is the fais view that the clubs sustainability depends on its investors and directors managing the companys affairs as a sensible business we await news of what the arkaga fund as investors in cork city investment fc ltd intend to do
4086811 if cork city investment fc ltd is in financial difficulty then the onus is on the clubs investors and directors to take all necessary corrective action to ensure its survival the fai has been and will continue to provide professional assistance to assist the club in any way possible at this difficult time
4086812 we just pass the ball to him and let him shoot within his range what i do is defend and rebound thats my role
4086813 now we have a chance to qualify for the quarter finals and we will try to do it for our people
4086814 i was a little afraid before the game after our loss to spain but our start was excellent
4086815 we had good skill and inside we had a big advantage
4086816 if we keep up our spirit we can fight against anyone including germany and greece
4086817 we cannot choose our opponents we need to beat them when we meet them
4086818 its a must win situation for us if were to make it to the quarter finals
4086819 they all shoot extremely well they should have beaten spain
4086820 it will be a tough game with the home crowd but it will be fun
4086821 we know they are a very good team and they have excellent three point shooting
4086822 we will go all out we have confidence to win every game
4086823 the idea would be that we dont stay at this early antlerless season very long
4086824 hopefully people will take advantage of this early hunt and start bringing that population down
4086825 for the most part most of the rifle guys are going to see it as another opportunity and enjoy it
4086826 as long as its not a rainy weekend the muzzleloader guys should have some of the best opportunity theyve had in years
4086827 a good percentage of the archery only guys arent going to be happy with that early antlerless season with a lot of guns going off and the rut possibly starting
4086828 after you download the system update readiness tool it runs a onetime scan for inconsistencies that might prevent future servicing operations this scan typically takes less than 15 minutes to run however the tool might take significantly longer on some computers the windows update progress bar is not updated during the scan and progress seems to stop at 60 complete for some time this behavior is expected the scan is still running and you should not cancel the update

4086830 weve really been encouraging people to go back out and check their fields because theres been so much movement
4086831 youve got to worry about whats reproducing in your own field and also whats producing in other fields theres been a lot of migration moving around of aphids this year
4086832 the big question is where are they all coming from
4086833 not everybody sprays their fields at the same time thats impossible
4086834 the earlier they were treated the more likely they needed to be treated a second time this year
4086835 some of these fields that might have been treated at sub threshold levels the farmer might have wiped out all of the beneficial insects too then those aphid populations can take right off again
4086836 with the narrow price of beans we have a more narrow window to get out there and treat
4086837 if you see a treatable population out there get on it right away
4086838 if that happens in the field populations can crash dramatically
4086839 theres a good looking crop out there we just want to get it finished off
4086840 the buffalo bills are doing terrific i think their step to toronto has helped strengthen that and i see the buffalo bills being in western new york for a long time

4086851 no matter the intention it is unacceptable and extremely hurtful for a majority group to freely make jokes about a minority group reinforcing the prejudice and discrimination that people with developmental disabilities have been fighting for generations
4086852 its downright mean and dehumanizing its horrific they dont deserve to be treated that way
4086853 people with cognitive and developmental disabilities are our family members our friends our neighbors and our co workers
4086854 they do not deserve to be ridiculed to get a laugh in a movie

4086878 while the champions league twenty20 is a domestic tournament not affected by icc event rules we have agreed to the icc request as a gesture of goodwill
4086879 we are happy that we were able to find a window during the first week of december for the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20 there was a gap in between the one day internationals and tests against the touring england squad and that will enable both the rajasthan royals and the chennai super kings to regroup and focus on the inaugural edition of the champions league twenty20
4086880 we were pleased with the waca reaction that the new playing dates offer local fans including corporate groups wanting to entertain at the cricket good dates for pre christmas test match enjoyment and we also took feedback from players that the changes could be accommodated without compromising what will be a de facto world test cricket championship bout between australia and south africa during december and january
4086881 the changes can be made without compromising crickets premium format and allow the significant benefits which the new champions league twenty20 will offer grassroots cricket to be delivered
4086882 this will be my last match i wanted to take gold so i consider this olympics a failure

4086890 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
4086891 if they opened it up a bit more i dont think it would hurt them and it would give them a lot better quality assurance
4086892 they just cant control everything and theyre losing valuable input that they could get from lots of people
4086893 its ok to have problems as long as you admit to them and fix them in fact if you admit to them and fix them it turns out to be an effect that creates more intense loyalty than you would expect
4086894 ive seen a number of issues with apple that would stop other vendors in their tracks and people are willing to give apple a break there
4086895 an intoxicating mix of brilliant industrial design transcendent software interfaces and consumable goods that are purely digital
4086896 apple could have stumbled meeting demand or failed on quality it did neither
4086897 when the itunes activation server went down on friday morning apple violated the cardinal rule first do no harm
4086898 fraught with problems including large initial downtime an extended e mail outage including lost messages the inability to contact the service to sync corruption of data time delays in syncing the computer to mobileme and more
4086899 apples mobileme designed for consumers could be potential headache for it managers
4086900 apple has always made great products and they always expect to be phenomenally successful at launch but i think the appetite in the public for this kind of product is probably surprising
4086901 but this one may have some effects thanks to the outsized press coverage that apple launches typically command

4086914 what i know is about tourists and what i know is about bujagali and im proud of it i dont want to lose it
4086915 and within our plans bujagali is one of those sources of power that we badly need
4086916 we have received a limited notice to proceed and we think we shall do ground breaking sometime in august
4086917 bujagali is simply going to be recycling the same water that is flowing out of these two dams at the moment and generating more power than these two dams combined
4086918 this lake is very important for the people of uganda and the region in kenya tanzania and rwanda and if the levels continue to go down as they are now 30 million people will be affected
4086919 and especially now that the region including uganda is being hit by climate change and global warming we are saying there is not enough water to produce the 250 megawatts
4086920 if they decide to construct the dam forcefully many people will die
4086921 those ones who will be working on the dam will die people will get so many problems some will even become mad
4086922 anyway they are just fighting the development otherwise they have failed because the thing has already passed the construction is starting it is late for them now they cannot succeed
4086923 interactieve marketing zal in de verenigde staten dit jaar in totaal 8 2 miljard dollar investeren

4086925 tegen 2012 zal het aandeel van de retailsector nog slechts 31 procent vertegenwoordigen van alle investeringen

4086927 a man with 10 wives would collapse and die but my own power is given by allah that is why i have been able to control 86 of them
4086928 i dont go looking for them they come to me i will consider the fact that god has asked me to do it and i will just marry them
4086929 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
4086930 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery
4086931 as soon as i met him the headache was gone
4086932 god told me it was time to be his wife praise be to god i am his wife now
4086933 i said i couldnt marry an older man but he said it was directly an order from god
4086934 i am now the happiest woman on earth when you marry a man with 86 wives you know he knows how to look after them

4086944 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4086945 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4086947 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4086948 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4086949 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4086950 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4086951 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4086952 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4086953 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
4086954 we looked at things like doctors certification and body mass index and decided that for us it wasnt an appropriate recommendation

4086956 babyplays recognizes that many parents want their children to experience the learning opportunity and skill development that comes through playing with a variety of toys however we also recognize that it is simply unnecessary to buy everything often times a parent will purchase a toy for their child only to find that within a few weeks or less the child is bored with that toy some parents respond to that boredom by purchasing yet more toys soon to find out that they have a room full of toys that are no longer of interest to their child
4086957 we will end up with millions of small farmers all over the world being driven off their land into unsustainable unmanageable degraded and dysfunctional conurbations of unmentionable awfulness

4086960 an industry group promoting a balanced view on gm crops in the uk
4086961 what is absolutely clear however is that gm is not the only solution there is no magic bullet no quick fix but it can help by improving productivity improving food quality and reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture a recent peer reviewed report on the subject by pg economics demonstrated that production of soybeans corn and cotton in areas planted with gm crops were respectively 20 7 and 15 higher than would have been the case had this technology not been used by farmers furthermore less fuel use and additional soil carbon storage from reduced ploughing facilitated by the use of gm crops was equivalent to removing over 6 million cars from the road for one year not quite the environmental disaster some claim

4086969 why are all christians such closed minded morons their attitude towards atheism is marked by perpetuating generalized misconceptions about honest seekers of truth like me often in the form of pitifully sterile insults they should celebrate those whose opinions differ from their own like we do stupid christians
4086970 completely unlike us christians never demand any more evidence for the validity of their belief than bandwagon appeals to common knowledge everybody knows this is true how could anybody even entertain conclusions drawn about an opposing point of view from such ridiculous ignorance hypocrites
4086971 and what about the bible if there is a god reason dictates that the bible should have compelling dynamic theological and ethical innovations unlikely to be conceived by human beings alone it should also offer strong circumstantial support for divine inspiration of course it does not i know this because i heard somebody quote a verse from it once
4086972 the bible has been proven many times through scholarly critical analysis to be nothing more than a biased collection of fairy tales written for the sole purpose of subjecting the superstitious masses under a code of moral liberty and civil enlightenment this conspiracy is what allows monsters like mother teresa to rule as the despicable despots they are breaking the spirits of proactive altruists everywhere
4086973 why is there any degree of disorder and injustice in the world its not like a perfectly black and white world would make the existence of god obvious thus removing our crucial need to develop faith in god and would reduce us to mindless automatons forced into conformity
4086974 the complex worldview that christianity posits suggests that humanity is an intricate tapestry of interdependence working towards a fundamentally greater collective good
4086975 by their fruits you will know them so has anyone ever abandoned a materially abundant lifestyle or altered behavior inconsistent with their beliefs because of religious conviction nobody that i know of this is because religion is only a selfish delusion of convenience not a vigorous and vital dimension of life whose empirical validity empowers adherents to make vastly positive personal change their wanton mental self indulgence is starkly revealed when placed in contrast with those of us who so stoically bear the spartan torch of atheism
4086976 i read this in the correspondence of a european philosopher and scientist to his brother in 1895 if there were in existence some supreme being why has he then withheld from his own children that most natural of blessings automated wheeled transportation for as any fool can see such a marvel absolutely be commensurate with the existence of god if not for this insurmountable flaw however i would gladly become a christian this perfectly logical query was never satisfactorily addressed and he died a happy atheist in 1948
4086977 clearly belief in god amounts to no more than wishful thinking simply put while those of us who accept atheism only do so after the most stringent open minded research into every possibility and then often reluctantly those who embrace any faith based belief system always do so blindly the more they explain their opinion the more they reveal their fundamental ignorance

4086992 die verdoppelung des aus und neubauetats f r die bundesfernstra en ist mit blick auf den gewaltigen investitionsbedarf zwingend geboten die zweckbindung der einnahmen aus der lkw maut f r die erhaltung der bundesfernstra en ist ein wichtiger schritt auf dem weg zu einem eigenst ndigen finanzierungskreislauf stra e
4086993 da es nun amtlich ist dass sich selbst die h chsten gerichte dieses landes nicht dar ber einigen k nnen wer f r streitigkeiten aus rabattvertr gen zust ndig ist muss der gesetzgeber endlich handeln und f r die dringend notwendige rechtsklarheit und rechtssicherheit sorgen
4086994 dagegen wird in sozialgerichtsverfahren nur die die einhaltung der materiellen grundz ge des vergaberechts berpr ft dadurch kann es zu unterschiedlichen rechtlichen bewertungen des gleichen sach verhaltes kommen
4086995 da nicht auszuschlie en ist dass es auch um diese ausschreibung rechtlichte auseinandersetzungen gibt muss der gesetzgeber schnellstm glich und eindeutig den rechtsweg festlegen kassen und industrie brauchen verl ssliche spielregeln
4086996 der gesetzgeber ist am zuge und muss jetzt endlich handeln sonst dauert die rechtsunsicherheit fort und wird erneut die gerichte besch ftigen denn dann m sste eine entscheidung des gemeinsamen senats der obersten gerichtsh fe des bundes abgewartet werden diesen erneuten zeitverlust darf sich der gesetzgeber nicht leisten

4087015 to pose with a wink to our participation in beijing
4087016 we thought it was something appropriate and that it would always be interpreted as somewhat loving
4087017 nevertheless some of the european media did not see it this way
4087018 it is unfortunate that this type of imagery would rear its head during something that is supposed to be a time of world unity
4087019 as asian pacific americans support u s olympic athletes some of whom are asian american it is disturbing to oca that spains basketball team would introduce such divisive imagery into the olympics
4087020 if they havent realized their mistake yet they probably will hear about it when the nba season comes back around
4087021 it was a gesture of affection and identification with the chinese people
4087022 ultimately there is a very good relationship between the chinese and spanish governments and there is no kind of conflict at all between the two peoples
4087023 from here i would like to declare that we have a huge respect for the east and their people
4087024 anyone who would like to interpret this differently is absolutely confused
4087025 in the end we can never be given knowledge by others we can only be stimulated we must develop our own knowledge
4087026 mok obsoja vsakr ne poskuse oviranja novinarjev ki opravljajo svoje delo v skladu s pravili in zakoni

4087031 na kitajskem ne preganjamo niti ne zapiramo nikogar zaradi dolo enih izjav samo tisti ki kr ijo zakone bodo kaznovani v skladu z zakonom
4087032 it is disgusting that mindless thieves are stooping this low
4087033 the drain cover thefts cost taxpayers millions of pounds while exposing drivers and pedestrians to injury or death
4087034 thousands of people have seen their community facilities stolen or damaged by thieves looking for a quick gain
4087035 the loss in value due to foreign exchange for the cyclone nargis international humanitarian aid during the last three months has been about us1 56 million 1 79 million
4087036 we are not getting the full value of dollars donated for emergency relief and donors are extremely worried and keen to see that this issue is resolved
4087037 the grand success of bindra proves that if the three important things that are family support state support and zeal to achieve for the country combine together lead to sure success
4087038 he controlled what they ate what they did he controlled pretty much everything
4087039 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve
4087040 its amazing they were not allowed outside they were simply not allowed to go near the door it all goes back to the control thing
4087041 what map where is this map what do i need a map for
4087042 following your heart is not about maps or directions or going off without thought dear camel following your heart is going where you know its right to go but you have to stop and listen and hear which way is right to go sometimes others will tell you which way is right to go and you need to listen carefully to their wisdom sometimes you know which way is right to go but you also need to listen carefully to your inner wisdom and believe it too so now dear camel look at the shadow of the sun and tell me what you sense about it
4087043 now camel what would a sensible animal do in the noon day sun when they are lost in a desert of sand
4087044 theyd stop for a bit to see which direction the sun travelled
4087045 i have endured that stigma for 15 years its fair to say it has ruined my life yet until now i have never received the slightest apology from the authorities for my ordeal i admit i got a bit emotional it means so much to me
4087046 a lot of wild figures had been bandied about but what i wanted more than money was for people to realise they got it wrong i thought the establishment would just make a token payment but this is like winning the lottery what pleases me even more than the money is that this is effectively a public apology
4087047 naturally colin is relieved and it will go some way to compensating him for the vilification that he has received at the hands of the public and media for the last 16 years
4087048 it will allow him to try and rebuild his life and to have some sort of normal existence but of course what he really wanted was an apology from the metropolitan police and i think he has accepted that that is something he will never get
4087049 i am quite satisfied that this amounts to misconduct in the investigation and prosecution of this case and i categorise it egregious
4087050 john macdougall gave more than 30 years of distinguished public service to fife as a councillor leader of the fife council convener of fife council and then mp for central fife he will be remembered as a true servant of the people
4087051 a very popular diligent local mp he served fife with great distinction in all the roles he played over three decades he has been a good personal friend of mine and i visited him on monday
4087052 we may have been on opposite sides in the commons but john carried the respect of people right across the chamber and was passionate for the issues he believed in and the welfare of his constituents which he cared about deeply he will be much missed
4087053 johns courageous fight against illness in recent times meant that parliament was denied his shrewd interventions on so many issues
4087054 by 2004 he makes the olympics by 2008 hell set world records by 2012 the olympics will be in new york and
4087055 grew unevenly it was his ears then he had very long arms then he would catch up somewhere else
4087056 unfortunately due to the fact that more than 24 hours have elapsed since he disappeared the police and coastguard have decided that there is nothing further that can be done at this stage
4087057 following the dive his father was first to surface and it appears that the boy was seen to surface soon after he was described by family as being seen slightly tilted backwards as though his jacket was inflated and was buoyant in no apparent signs of distress
4087058 having surfaced there appears to have been a problem trying to start the small boat and the father subsequently called for help from a passing charter boat who came to assist it is at this point that all parties lost sight of the boy
4087059 i was taking customers on a diving trip when i saw the small craft and a man waving his arms
4087060 there is a huge amount of money in football and its only fair that everyone working for a premier league club should reap the benefits
4087061 paying the living wage is not only morally right but makes good business sense too
4087062 george clooney is clearly an outstanding film maker and ive got no doubt hes going to do a fantastic job with this
4087063 i think swift has taken a lot of people by surprise
4087064 he had been a minor lawyer defending wayward service personnel on things like child molestation charges
4087065 suddenly hes appointed by the pentagon to defend an enemy combatant and he ends up suing george w bush its difficult not to be impressed by his sense of duty by the idea that justice transcends the allegiances of war im sure thats part of the appeal to george clooney
4087066 had this extraordinary relationship suddenly a man in a military uniform walks into his room one day and says hi im charlie swift im your lawyer you can trust me hamdan would go on hunger strike after hunger strike and here was this man in a uniform literally trying to feed him and stop him from going mad several times hamdan tried to sack the man who wanted to save him but swift refused to budge
4087067 the findings are important because of the role drink plays in for example unsafe sex
4087068 this story about jolie taking over is completely false this started with an inaccurate report months ago that said cruise was taking the role
4087069 they courted him for almost a year for this movie he considered it but passed
4087070 hes been offered many roles in the past few months were sure to see news about the next project soon
4087071 i think we all knew the restructuring plan was going to take a lot of time to put together
4087072 whats shocking to me is how long the court of appeals is taking
4087073 just save your data with us and we will take care of it

4087117 a friend of mine was doing up an old triumph it was 12 to 15 years old at the time
4087118 i said we ought to get something really old pre war i found a 1920s model in the breakers yard so i bought it for seven pounds and 10 shillings and took it home
4087119 it was so old it didnt have clutch you had to run and jump with it then one bike led to another
4087120 it is important to stress that whilst we do not routinely fund this drug at this time we always consider carefully any application from a patients doctor to fund a drugs use in individual cases where it is believed there may be exceptional circumstances
4087121 it is also important to stress that a patient has the right of appeal should they be unhappy with the outcome of an review panel decision
4087122 the stress of it just coming to terms with this terrible disease and at the same time knowing that robert is worried because he doesnt want to leave me penniless its just so terrible

4087163 at first everything was fine but then we virtually scored their equaliser for them and it was a big mental blow it ruined our game
4087164 after the interval we changed our tactical plan but conceded more and fell apart completely
4087165 today we felt the importance of the occasion and played like a real team
4087166 i apologise to the fans for the shame they suffered today lets face it we have missed out on the chance to qualify for the group stage
4087167 a 2 0 scoreline could be dangerous and is certainly not enough to make us feel confident about our place in the group stage
4087168 we had plenty of opportunities to make it 3 0 which would have made things more comfortable as we will have a very tough match in zagreb
4087169 he was not actively responding to me and he was just sitting on the sofa refusing to talk he kept ignoring me and fell asleep so i covered him in a quilt

4087178 we have a lot of vehicles all trying to get into the port of felixstowe this morning its like trying to squeeze too many into too small a space at one time
4087179 its a real logjam and we are trying to sort it out as quickly as possible
4087180 hopefully if we can get some of the workers through the traffic to the dock they can help resolve it
4087181 weve written to let women know of this issue because they have a right to know that the diary has gone missing
4087182 we have assured them that this in no way compromises any of their clinical care this is a diary not health records
4087183 to set some context more than 2 000 women give birth at the infirmary annually there is no need for anyone who has not been contacted by us to take any action whatsoever

4087189 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
4087190 we believe this was caused by mass spam e mails mentioning the just say no deal network of blogs which in turn caused our system to classify the blog addresses mentioned in the e mails as spam
4087191 we have restored posting rights to the affected blogs and it is very important to us that blogger remain a tool for political debate and free expression
4087192 the last wave was this past week and now it got very quiet
4087193 malicious intentions at all its just that spammers can literally overrun a service if youre not careful so their defenses have become overzealous
4087194 we always have human review before turning off an active blog
4087195 people invest so much time into their blogs to treat it with anything less than the utmost respect is criminal
4087196 if anyone feels offended by it we totally apologize for it
4087197 we felt it was something appropriate and that it would be interpreted as an affectionate gesture
4087198 all of the spanish people are close to the chinese people mentally
4087199 to me it was little clownish for our part to be doing that
4087200 it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
4087201 that womans body should seriously be put in a museum somewhere it is almost superhuman

4087215 even after losing world champion lightweight frankie gavin to weight problems shortly before the beijing games began the british team has been a significant presence in the tournament
4087216 the teams been so successful that we couldnt really ask for anything else
4087217 ive been getting good luck messages all the time and that puts pressure on you and because the team has been so successful that puts pressure on you too
4087218 the british fighters are an exceptionally entertaining lot as well
4087219 i think i might have paid him a bit too much respect
4087220 that enabled our boxers to have a full time life in boxing
4087221 then we went out and we boxed around the world we didnt win a lot but we didnt go on easy tours so our fighters would actually realize what its like at the top of the world stage now theyre coming through and boxing to the potential that we expect
4087222 im talking about progression with our team and weve got our big prize obviously in 2012 in london thats what our aim is we brought a very young team relatively to beijing and thats the process to lead up to 2012
4087223 i think it was presented as you need to sign on to this
4087224 my guess is it was presented as this is the best i can get

4087226 while investigating the b amp es in the 4800 block of grand view flats road the officers in their attempt to secure the residence discovered a marijuana grow operation the residence was secured and a search warrant was obtained

4087228 officers boarded the bus and located the woman matching the description given she was asleep at the back of the bus at the time the suspect was removed from the bus a search of her was conducted and a 9 mm handgun was recovered hidden under her clothing
4087229 at no time while the police were dealing with the suspect were any passengers in any danger two other passengers travelling with the suspect were questioned and allowed to continue on their way
4087230 the motorcycle collided with an oncoming car both occupants of the motorcycle were ejected and suffered serious injuries the driver suffered extensive leg injuries and the 40 year old female passenger suffered neck and back injuries
4087231 the city said that if the jacks did not sign the lease agreement according to their terms they wouldnt provide services to a 15 acre development property adjacent to the property in question
4087232 i am very pleased that these negotiations have resulted in an agreement that is beneficial to all the parties involved
4087233 i particularly want to thank the jack family and the okanagan indian band for their willingness to come to the table and continue talks with the city as i know that all parties were committed to reaching a positive agreement
4087234 so far there is currently no convincing evidence from animal or human studies that the energy from cell phones is enough to cause serious health effects such as cancer epileptic seizures or sleep disorders
4087235 the new guidelines were issued by the american academy of pediatrics and the push to aggressively screen and medicate for high cholesterol in children is certain to create controversy amid a continuing debate about the use of prescription drugs in children as well as the best approaches to ward off heart disease in adults
4087236 the new design signals a more upscale direction for one of vancouvers most established brands
4087237 the new milestones is sensuous and hip while still being warm and welcoming
4087238 the awards committee considered this plan an excellent way to celebrate cultural history and a playful form of way finding while helping residents and visitors to experience the area to its fullest
4087239 we are very excited to partner with nona this year for our third annual moonlight serenade gala their work is making such a difference in the lives of families throughout the okanagan and we want to contribute to their efforts
4087240 this event has been such a success for the past two years and we have no doubt the community will work with us again to support this cause with the same high level of enthusiasm
4087241 everything is premised around waterfront in the okanagan private moorage is a rarity moorage is at a high premium in the area and can be extremely prohibitive having a private place for your boat is a unique privilege that the sheerwater lifestyle affords
4087242 his style of dealing with employees is probably something people in my position arent crazy about
4087243 but if you look at his history he tends to grow companies he is involved with we are hopeful in that regard
4087244 is a real sign of confidence in the brand in our strategic direction
4087245 one thing thats the same is that we are executing against a strategic plan that has been in place for a number of years
4087246 but this is not likely to offset the losses in the first half of the year
4087247 good earth has cafes open throughout alberta with a strategic road map to expand across all of western canada
4087248 we are extremely excited by the opening of our first bc location in kelowna on pandosy south the new cafe will allow us to serve our great coffee and great food to new customers as well as to visiting albertans in the area we have strong awareness in alberta and our cafes are easy to operate
4087249 i think the kelowna area is the perfect place to open a good earth cafe
4087250 more and more people are familiar with the company both local and visiting albertans and i know they will love the good earth concept and service we provide
4087251 always use the selected program to open this kind of file
4087252 we will support any decisions taken by the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia and not only do we support it but we will guarantee them both in the caucasus and throughout the world
4087253 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4087254 i said from the very beginning that if any such facts prove true we will react in the most serious way the peaceful population should be protected we are investigating all these reports and will not allow any such actions
4087255 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to carry out procedures of handing over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
4087256 all buildings are in normal shape the town is supplied with water and electricity
4087257 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbours that what it thinks about us policy

4087265 thats why we took him and used our own method that of the string to get him to agree to the allegations against him
4087266 after a recent meeting between wad and the kings daughters regarding the status of other known women who are still making business on the streets it was such a disgusting shame to have been informed that high ranking leaders who hold very senior positions in society are still engaging in the sexual exploitation of commercial sex workers in the dark alleys and corners of windhoek and its suburbs
4087267 wad was further informed that these honourable clients are now picking up the women from their homes in the presence of their young daughters who could become copy cats of their mothers
4087268 these clients have even now lowered their payment for services rendered which amounts to further exploitation
4087269 given the fact that government has continuously spoken out in the past against female exploitation and respect of the most vulnerable members of society
4087270 im not willing to say until im on the ground
4087271 various landmarks in the united states including new york city
4087272 chemical substances in gel and liquid form that were sealed in bottles and glass jars
4087273 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
4087274 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
4087275 we have been under siege for the last two years
4087276 the only thing left is for them to invade and kill us
4087277 if the cease fire is just a front for extremists in gaza to rearm and regroup of course we have the right to act
4087278 any arms buildup is a direct violation of the calm that was achieved
4087279 they control the gaza strip with quite an iron fist if you dont mind me saying and none of this activity with the other groups would be happening unless hamas was complicit and allowing it to happen
4087280 excessive and unwarranted use of force against the people of indian occupied kashmir
4087281 resulting in loss of life and property of the kashmiri people
4087282 he controlled what they ate what they did he controlled pretty much everything
4087283 i asked did you go to help and they looked at me like it was the strangest question dad pretty much did whatever he wanted to do
4087284 the victims of this type of abuse theyre made to believe theyre not worthy of anything that this is what they deserve
4087285 its amazing they were not allowed outside they were simply not allowed to go near the door it all goes back to the control thing
4087286 i think its just hitting her what she is going through
4087287 we have to fight back the challenges of terrorism and extremism
4087288 the war against terrorism and extremism is the war of our own survival with the peoples cooperation we will fight this war and ensure the governments writ at all costs
4087289 for another two days russian troops will stay in the region to hand over control functions to georgian law enforcement bodies after which they will leave
4087290 all night they said they would leave and now they have changed their mind georgian forces have stopped going to gori to avoid clashes with the russians
4087291 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4087292 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
4087293 theres been some talk that the city is destroyed that there is looting
4087294 in the past few there were some facts of looting on the territory of the republic
4087295 yesterday our law enforcement bodies shot dead two looters caught red handed today we will handle the issue even tougher
4087296 if we want to put our economy on the right track and fight terrorism then we need political stability unless we bring political stability i think we cant fight them properly
4087297 political stability in my view can only be brought through a reconciliation approach as opposed to confrontation
4087298 the era of repression is over forever dictatorship has become a tale of the past
4087299 for political reconciliation general musharraf has to quit reconciliation is not possible without it
4087300 the war against extremism and terrorism is a war for our own survival
4087301 it brought me comfort and i thought about it a lot
4087302 he was the master of the word and wisdom the symbol who expressed our national feeling our human constitution our declaration of independence
4087303 we loved him he was a poet and true palestinian patriot
4087304 he lived the whole palestinian life from 1948 until now
4087305 the world must open its eyes to the plight of us tibetans rather than focusing on the beijing olympics
4087306 i will continue to protest unless china guarantees human rights in tibet
4087307 we have arrested more than 500 as they were protesting in a restricted zone
4087308 after all the effort that we put in to get somebody a fair trial and then to say no matter what we did it didnt matter i dont see that as a positive step

4087318 if you find yourself in agreement with the green party then vote for the green party
4087319 those who delivered us into this mess can not be trusted to get us out of it
4087320 if you have a green party i want to join
4087321 da stellt sich mir noch eine letzte frage wem hilft das schlussendlich
4087322 i know god was watching me over all these years
4087323 we are expecting 10 15 knots from the north tomorrow although it is expected to be shifting which may make it difficult to set a good course
4087324 we have our own food and chef here to try and prevent stomach problems and we try to take all precautions with a full sterilisation programme but unless you are not going to touch anything there is always a risk
4087325 we have a lot of hard work ahead of us
4087326 we did finish last in the nfc east we have to make sure we buckle ourselves down like we have the last couple weeks here and finish the rest of camp and preseason the right way it hasnt been easy and it wont be easy once we get into the grind its tough to climb back up that ladder
4087327 we are very fortunate to have all three of them
4087328 right now we are just in the process of getting a support staff set up for him in philadelphia
4087329 we have taken and made some direction there or at least have it going in the right direction there
4087330 he was playing so well at the end of the season that i think he just picked up from there
4087331 obviously you try to keep getting better but he was just playing at such a high level there i dont see where its a huge jump from that
4087332 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc
4087333 were going to be much more intelligent about harvesting other market opportunities for spore than we were with the sims which as big as it was in the game space pretty much remains in the game space
4087334 longer term i think the brand of spore potentially has a wider net to cast than the sims did
4087335 the computer could observe each player and capture a lot of metrics which could be used to change the game so that it becomes personalized for him his game becomes a reflection of who he is internally
4087336 computer gaming would be like having your own spielberg and his whole job in life would be to craft a personal entertainment experience just for you
4087337 releasing rock band 2 as a standalone disc on september 14th and releasing the special edition on october 19th strikes me as pretty messed up
4087338 eva is desperately trying to get pregnant with tony parker
4087339 after they phone their doctor she promised me i will be the next call
4087340 it looks like the high price has done its job in destroying demand
4087341 i screamed make the headache go away make the headache go away but it never went away
4087342 i m in my titties and everyone thinks i m in my seventies i have to stoop when i walk so i won t fall over they took my youth away with those x rays
4087343 they brought them in lines firsttheir heads were shaved and smeared in burning gel then a ball was put between their legs and the children were ordered not to drop it so they wouldn t move the children weren t protected over the rest of their bodies there were no lead vests for them i was told i was doing good by helping to improve ringworm if i knew what dangers the children were facing i would never have cooperated never

4087351 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing
4087352 one can assume that the front six tentacles have the function of arms and that the back two take over the function of legs
4087353 people have always assumed that octopuses coordinate their gripping behaviour through visual data that seems to be true when one eye is weak another side of arms is favoured
4087354 they have taken our passports this is a reflection of their insincerity they want to talk to us yet they behave like hooligans
4087355 all that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing

4087357 sir richmond and miss grammont went out into the moonlit gloaming crossed the bridge and followed the road beside the river towards the old abbey church that lantern of the west said sir richmond its only through love that god can reach over from one human being to another all real love is a divine thing
4087358 aqu hay unas normas que cumplir un mismo baremo justo para todos el que quiera cualquier tipo de publicidad que la pague que tramite la pertinente licencia
4087359 el west end londinense es todo una atracci n a nivel mundial y el destino de 3 5 millones de turistas por cada semana no hay cabida para este tipo de publicidad cutre y barata
4087360 entra dentro las expectativas de los turistas disfrutar del murmullo y traj n de gentes en la zona de oxford street y covent garden pero desde luego lo que no no desean es tener que abrirse paso entre los portadores y de este tipo de publicidad que abarrotan las calles o ver c mo quedan desfiguradas con su presencia el bonito entorno protegido de esta zona de la capital
4087361 it was a unanimous decision meaning she was leading on all the three judges score cards at the end of the scheduled four rounds
4087362 i think the win will open more avenues for her and other zimbabwean boxers
4087363 i am particularly happy that she won a belt that had been pledged by one of the banks in the drc for that particular bout
4087364 i have worked with monalisa for a very long time and have seen her going for a training stint in zambia with mwamba
4087365 results of that training are now bearing fruit as shown by the win in the drc
4087366 at the moment i have not talked to the boxer but i think she needs more of these international fights before she tries a world title fight
4087367 she is a good boxer with a unique style and determination but rather faces distractions here and there
4087368 however with the right support mentally and financially i am certain she will bring a recognised international belt home
4087369 that would also create ground for us to return to the negotiating table
4087370 a te k hai reso la mia bella da morire
4087371 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4087372 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4087373 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4087374 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4087375 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4087376 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4087377 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4087378 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4087379 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4087380 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4087381 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4087382 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4087383 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
4087384 there are no formal reasons to stop these accession talks
4087385 the statements that our accession should be delayed because of events in georgia sound strange
4087386 it contradicts basic logic common sense and promises that were given by the governments of western countries to russia
4087387 sorry for a rude expression but every time they are just fooling us around
4087388 after the july crisis russias accession could have provided support for the organization which is experiencing serious systemic problems
4087389 in this situation i do not think that this resumption of talks with georgia is possible therefore we will look at other ways of solving the problem
4087390 all sides are set to lose due to a delay of russias accession who will lose most is difficult to say
4087391 dont you worry about the distance im right there if you get lonely

4087393 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

4087396 avoid using null on string based fields such as charfield and
4087397 ive been in the game a long while so it was always going to come around that it would change a little
4087398 im not too fussed im probably doing the other 19 managers a favour at the moment
4087399 i dont read too much into it its all part and parcel of being a premier league manager there are a lot of ups and downs
4087400 results determine a lot of things so im not too concerned
4087401 i get a bit fed up with some of the premeditated stuff i think we have to be judged on what we do and judged on where we are at and how we attack things
4087402 avoid the crowds circuit city stores are closed on thanksgiving day on november 23 the day after thanksgiving we ask that you pick up your online purchase after 12 01 p m due to the high volume of traffic in our stores dont worry we have set aside the item s you ordered your order will be waiting for you at the customer service counter when youre ready to pick it up
4087403 bij de huidige prijsniveaus deze afboekingen of gerealiseerde verliezen op aandelen in de komende kwartalen naar verwachting aanzienlijk zullen toenemen
4087404 gezien de aanhoudende turbulentie in de mondiale financiele markten met sterk dalende aandelenmarkten beperkte toegang tot liquiditeit en stijgende rente
4087405 de gerealiseerde verliezen op de aandelenportefeuille zullen aanhouden de financieringskosten zullen stijgen onze vastgoedfinanciering kan te maken krijgen met tegenvallers in deze onzekere tijden het einde van de financiele crisis is nog niet in zicht

4087433 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4087434 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4087435 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4087436 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4087437 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4087455 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
4087456 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
4087457 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
4087458 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
4087459 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
4087460 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
4087461 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

4087531 we are bombarded in the news with afghanistan so to be taken by the hand into that country and to meet the people through the joy of reading a novel is a really remarkable thing chimamanda ngozi adichies half of a yellow sun does that too you feel youve been absolutely changed that your understanding of the world has been significantly enhanced and not through reading a dry history book theres a huge appetite for that and i think khaled is the strongest at providing it

4087545 it hasnt been easy but overall it shows that with good planning good people and the right attitude success can be achieved in a different discipline
4087546 if we approach things in a certain way it optimises peoples chances of success so far its just reconfirmed that what we do on the track can be done in other areas maybe its given me even greater conviction to think that were only scratching the surface you can point at these results and say this is what we can do
4087547 were more confident now in being able to plan to win big events rather than merely dreaming you can say there is a realistic chance and you can set about it id like to give credit to our coaches team psychiatrist steve peters gets a lot of credit and so do the riders but the coaches are doing the day in day out stuff and that makes the difference

4087564 if you ask me if theres an electricity crunch in kenya id say there is and there isnt
4087565 we are just about meeting our current electricity demand there are no power cuts no load shedding as such the gap between demand and supply is negligible
4087566 but in terms of financing and covering the cost of electricity generation it is not only kenya but also tanzania and uganda that are facing a crunch
4087567 we have no coal so far no gas and no oil the rift valley is rich in geo thermal energy and in time a bigger chunk of the countrys power will come from this source
4087568 its adverse impact on agriculture is well known but fortunately kenyas geothermal plants will be located in semi desert areas of the valley where there is no farming land to be affected
4087569 we dont fully know the potential of our geothermal sources it could be anywhere between 2000 to 7000 megawatts but it is the way forward for kenya
4087570 kenya will have to start thinking out of the box and tap unconventional sources of energy to speed up its economic growth
4087571 the urban rural disparity is glaring the country may be meeting its industrial and urban energy demands but that covers only 15 20 percent of the population in the rural areas people still consume charcoal and wood which makes up about 80 percent of all energy used in the country
4087572 at about 1100 mw the current supply cannot industrialize kenya nor drive it to achieve its development goals fast enough
4087573 it is usually growth in the economy which drives the demand for electricity and energy and not the other way around as is generally believed
4087574 electricity is only one ingredient in the cost of production the other ingredients are capital markets for the goods produced and an enabling environment raw materials and technology and lastly the energy input
4087575 above all the absolutely essential ingredient of economic production is the people and their working culture the real force behind industrial and economic growth is the people we need our own people to run and manage industry ourselves
4087576 the cost of transmission and distribution to kenyas rural areas is also prohibitive villages here are not compact residential areas houses and people are scattered on farms of varying sizes and there is no village system
4087577 though well have to keep looking to donor agencies like the world bank for financing the problem will not go away unless kenya becomes self reliant promotes a culture of local investment and develops and exploits its own resources
4087578 hemos estado trabajando durante esta pretemporada con buenas actuaciones como el martes en fr ncfort para prepararnos para una temporada a la que aspiramos a ganar los 4 torneos oficiales que disputaremos
4087579 valencia es un gran rival de ninguna manera esta supercopa es una piedra en el camino previo a la liga sino que es el primer torneo oficial de la temporada
4087580 ganar la supercopa ser a un buen principio de temporada para comenzar la liga con fuerza y vamos a intentar ganarla como la liga la champions y la copa del rey
4087581 convertir los que sean necesarios todos los delanteros lo que quieren es marcar muchos goles la pasada campa a consegu ocho y si esta temporada son m s mejor
4087582 por suerte el real madrid tiene cuatro delanteros que vemos a luchar por un puesto o por dos vamos a ir con ley es una competencia sana
4087583 hay cuatro grandes jugadores eso me pone contento y me hace pensar en trabajar cada d a m s

4087622 an industry group promoting a balanced view on gm crops in the uk
4087623 what is absolutely clear however is that gm is not the only solution there is no magic bullet no quick fix but it can help by improving productivity improving food quality and reducing the environmental footprint of agriculture a recent peer reviewed report on the subject by pg economics demonstrated that production of soybeans corn and cotton in areas planted with gm crops were respectively 20 7 and 15 higher than would have been the case had this technology not been used by farmers furthermore less fuel use and additional soil carbon storage from reduced ploughing facilitated by the use of gm crops was equivalent to removing over 6 million cars from the road for one year not quite the environmental disaster some claim

4087638 from our perspective we have a bias towards those banking names that have been less affected by the crisis since they represent the best combination of offence and defence
4087639 in other words if things get worse they should outperform if things get better they should be in a position to accelerate earnings growth more rapidly
4087640 we have seen investors moving into names that are perceived to be of higher quality with less exposure to some of the troubled areas of the markets the strategy of simply buying last years worst performer has lost some of its lustre
4087641 will show quite favourably relatively to the canadian banks where we forecast aggregate 2008 earnings to fall short mainly due to weaker capital markets activity and deteriorating credit quality
4087642 we continue to view brookfields shares as a core holding for many investors and a potentially interesting alternative to traditional financial stocks such as banks
4087643 were seeing rotation into the utilities and out of large cap stocks that are seen as higher risk
4087644 based on high quality long life assets and low risk regulated pipeline business models
4087645 negative assessment of both medium term credit risks and capital market pressures facing domestic banks over the next 12 18 months
4087646 its the first time a sponsor in highly constrained markets has combined the two in a single deal
4087647 has managed to combine some banking with some bonds in order to address the constraint of spreads in both areas
4087648 it was great to do well at st pete and we knew it was going to be challenging and it certainly has been
4087649 weve worked hard as a team and i think that we saw we were getting closer and i think we are its just it takes quite a lot of time and effort to get to the top
4087650 being that we came in so late in the year that the merger was announced so late it didnt give us any time to really prepare so the first opportunity we are going to have is obviously this upcoming off season we are extremely looking forward to that its been obviously busy not only for us but everybody and to keep this thing going has been quite the challenge
4087651 similar to shares issued by corporations paying a fraction of corporate earnings in dividends the trill would pay a fraction of the earnings of canada
4087652 trills are an asset that cannot be replicated with existing assets and would allow investors new portfolio diversification strategies that preserve high returns and lower volatility
4087653 such a security would be attractive to private and public pension funds as it would provide access to a broader range of income earning potential in canada
4087654 however we will be reviewing the specific proposals and analysis put forward in this paper
4087655 the cost of issuing trills would be low possibly less than some current government securities
4087656 with the economic slowdown now spreading to regions that had been assumed to be immune such as the euro zone u s assets are starting to look relatively attractive to institutional investors
4087657 the net balance of asset allocators overweight u s equities now stands at its highest level in more than six years supported by a widely held belief that the u s dollar is undervalued
4087658 sweet rust free 1 of 1 factory built pinto race truck twin turbo 4 cyl bumper dragging beast
4087659 ford picked me over bob glidden to drive cause he couldnt handle this monster

4087661 peace i leave with you my peace i give to you not as the world gives do i give to you let not your hearts be troubled neither let them be afraid
4087662 its just a stretch so you let it settle down for two or three days without doing any running the thing theyre so encouraged with him is thats where all his strength is in his legs and lower body
4087663 we still have a lot to work on and pick up
4087664 but it makes us feel good to know that the offense is working and guys are actually learning now instead of memorizing the offense were learning defenses and were able to make plays the razorbacks posted gains of more than 10 yards on five of those first eight plays
4087665 i guess its one of the good scrimmages ive had
4087666 its not all about the sacks i had its about trying to go out there and give more effort on each and every snap every time i get out there
4087667 my shoulder is a little tender and i dont have all the strength back in it but i was able to get some plays in
4087668 i was a little tentative at first but got warmed up and it felt pretty good
4087669 it was a full speed collision from a guy running down the field from 60 yards away
4087670 it was a little scary because stuff went numb and you started thinking uhoh whats happening
4087671 but i went to the sideline and got with the trainers and they know what theyre doing
4087672 it was really good to have him back and hes excited to be back
4087673 we need to bring him along to see if he can help us this season
4087674 plus the older guys are getting a lot of reps out here and starting to get a little worn down so its good to have a fresh guy in there
4087675 but he curtis says hes definitely going to beat that
4087676 he did some good things in the scrimmage but we are still not as consistent as we need to be
4087677 anytime i get one deep ball thrown on me its very disappointing
4087678 we talk about it all the time deep balls will get you beat
4087679 you have to have young men that can find the football
4087680 you have to have the kind of guys that are mentally tough when they get beat
4087681 they can forget about that play and go back and play the next play because theres not a defensive back thats played any level of football that hasnt been beat deep
4087682 the first element pertains to getting the defensive call right applying the call is the second part and making a quick assessment of what happened concludes the process
4087683 if our eyes are all over the place were never going to have a chance to play the ball
4087684 we have to read the defense and know the schemes this year
4087685 a sudden and drastic reduction in the availability of credit
4087686 a small scale environmentally friendly settlement designed for sustainable living
4087687 a wife or girlfriend of a professional sportsman especially one of group accompanying a travelling team
4087688 the temporary failure of an item of clothing to do its job in covering a part of the body that it would be advisable to keep covered
4087689 id love to be able to hold the south african flag up high there it would be fantastic to come away with a medal south africa is struggling a bit at these games
4087690 these times are ridiculously fast the world of swimming has changed drastically i think it will only get faster itll take a 21 2 or 21 3 to win here
4087691 tomorrow is going to be another day and then saturday will be a real dogfight until the end
4087692 alain and eamon will be a bit tired from this morning i expect them to be a bit more lively tomorrow and saturday
4087693 i decided to change my training this year i had ten years of the same thing and i decided to do some things differently
4087694 if it pays off fantastic this is how you learn the aussies and the french are obviously doing something right and hopefully i can take some experience from this
4087695 id love to walk away with a medal but in all reality nothing is written in stone
4087696 i told him i wasnt either id never been out of arkansas
4087697 virginia has a long tradition of outdoor recreation mark supported amending the virginia constitution to preserve hunting and fishing rights he supports the second amendment and as governor hell preserve virginias public parks and protect the rights of sportsmen
4087698 why i want mark warner to run for president i fish for largemouth and striped bass i love nhra drag racing and have taken my own car down the track a number of times i believe everyone has a right to own a gun i drive a dodge 1500 hemi pickup with which i tow my boat to the lake and i served in the navy for 9 years if you knew nothing more about me than this many of my democratic friends would consider this a bio of a republican
4087699 calling someone stupid because they live in a red state is counterproductive and just plain wrong we must listen to the folks first then provide real answers as to why they should be voting for democrats
4087700 hes very talented and has a lot of good football ahead of him
4087701 i told him to make some visits and make sure he knew where he wanted to go
4087702 he had a lot of good schools after him and he just wanted to get this out of the way
4087703 he father was at arkansas over 30 years ago so im sure that helped
4087704 alvin is a good kid bailey reports a 4 9 time in the pro shuttle drill along with a 400 pound bench press a 590 squat and a 24 inch vertical jump
4087705 this is a chance for us to solidify our multimedia rights revenue
4087706 i think earlier when we talked to the media about some of the ticket price increases i mentioned that thats not the only place were going to go to generate some revenue that we need to support our programs and support our student athletes
4087707 this is one of them i felt like we had an opportunity to increase our revenue stream in a new media age
4087708 katv has done just an absolutely incredible job with the broadcast rights but there were a lot of rights that were left behind such as signage football and basketball stadiums publications internet web rights
4087709 now all of these things will be combined into one package
4087710 weve got places like alabama auburn and the university of washington and ucla where we run nine and 10 hour game days on the radio side of the business
4087711 in a place like this where the school owns the state we think theres an opportunity
4087712 quite honestly the formula for them is that they wont reach those numbers in the early years
4087713 their goal would be to develop this business over the course of that 10 year period where theyre making their money in the out years of the contract
4087714 our agreement with isp not only helps protect us from uncertain financial times but also guarantees revenue at a significantly higher level than what we have generated in the past
4087715 as our budget continues to reflect the increasing costs associated with operating a 19 sport program the increased revenue generated from this partnership will help us secure the essential funding to support our more than 450 student athletes and provide them the resources to succeed in the southeastern conference and nationally
4087716 isp is truly excited to establish this new relationship with the university of arkansas one of the great athletic programs in the country
4087717 we also are excited about being able to work with katv and building on the 40 year tradition katv has established in bringing the passion of razorback athletics to the state of arkansas
4087718 we are pleased that through our new agreement with isp katv will remain at the forefront of razorback coverage for many years to come
4087719 we have enjoyed our four decade partnership with the university of arkansas and are looking forward to maintaining that relationship moving forward via our partnership with isp as the continuing home of the razorbacks
4087720 from the beginning of our discussions with katv and isp i was excited about what the partnership would mean for razorback athletics
4087721 i have worked with a number of other multi media rightsholders but in my opinion isp is the best and is clearly the leader in college sports
4087722 any time you get out here and see results see big plays what could be if you execute every play and think about what we could do this year its really exciting
4087723 we have got to get better everywhere we have got to get 11 guys who are going to do their job
4087724 we executed better on offense and the defense learned how to run to the ball and did some good tackling well learn a lot from that video
4087725 i was just doing what i do best running straight up the field and using my speed
4087726 i just had to make sure i caught the ball
4087727 he threw the ball well and hes starting to distribute it
4087728 i thought we got a lot of good things accomplished got to our checks today with not so much hesitation at the line of scrimmage
4087729 we just felt good today and made some good completions good throws london and those guys made some great catches and turned little catches into big yards for us
4087730 any time i get one deep ball caught on me its disappointing
4087731 we talk about it all the time deep balls will get you beat we want to tackle the catch in front of us and we dont want to give you the deep ball we let some people get behind us and it shouldnt happen no question the first defense was the majority of that
4087732 we took the inflatable monkey and sheep through the entire kama sutra last night
4087733 damn sorry i missed it is it on you tube
4087734 yes and this one will be too if you sit down
4087735 well i dont know will two people fit under a rock
4087736 both you go to yours and ill go to mine
4087737 hey come on were both here at this bar for the same reason
4087738 yeah but if i saw you naked id probably die laughing
4087739 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
4087740 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
4087741 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
4087742 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
4087743 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
4087744 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
4087745 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
4087746 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
4087747 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves

4087761 the lower manhattan initiative is expected to be in place by 2010
4087762 it is one tool of ensuring that if there is somebody on a terrorist watch list or someone driving erratically or if a pattern develops that raises suspicions it gives them an opportunity to investigate further and if need be track down the drivers or the passengers

4087768 there had been pressure and speculations for weeks as four month ago two american aircraft were in the region for three hours although such incidents generate assumptions they couldnt be always linked with military actions
4087769 we share good rapport with the defence forces here as we are engaging with many common activities and the visit of crown prince and deputy commander of bahrain defence force shaikh salman bin hamad al khalifa to the american military base this monday was the best example
4087770 the international coalition led by the us plays a key role in maintaining stability and security along the maritime borders and international waters
4087771 the visit came to reinforce ties between the two countries as the crown prince showed interest to move relations to a higher level when he called for the return of the families of the us military staff that left for america for security reasons

4087782 it gives him a better operating space because now he can actually report substantial progress and it came at a critical point for the pressure that he was under both domestically and internationally
4087783 whatever progress and achievements made during this week may amount to nothing if a deal is not achieved soon

4087785 to the extent that the approach by president mbeki led to mugabe and zanu pf to get to the negotiation table then the much maligned strategy did pay off
4087786 no other country outside south africa would have been able to get mugabe to sit around a table
4087787 its hard to ascribe directly the deterioration in zimbabwe to south african non action but a more critical and vocal stance might have given the mugabe regime pause and perhaps assist to arrest the deterioration at an earlier stage
4087788 by taking this soft approach we have perhaps in many respects allowed this to continue much longer than it ever should have

4087815 hard working families are struggling to keep up with their mortgage payments as they also cope with the rising costs of fuel and food
4087816 we have to take action to ease the pain of a crisis thats putting people out on the streets devastating our neighborhoods and endangering children
4087817 as i walk through the neighborhoods of house district 97 every night i see streets lined with boarded up homes once well maintained yards full of trash and weeds and the burned out remains of vacant properties these abandoned houses attract gangs criminals and illegal dumping we must do more to stabilize and rebuild neighborhoods that continue to be devastated by this epidemic
4087818 i believe my proposal will help prevent future losses and provide immediate assistance to those who need help now
4087819 it is unacceptable to stand by and watch as our neighbors lose their homes
4087820 high gas prices rising healthcare costs and record job losses have pushed hoosiers to the brink making it increasingly difficult to keep up with their mortgage payments entire sections of our communities are being boarded up and left for auction at sheriffs sales we need to do better for our homeowners
4087821 struggling homeowners who seek to refinance should not be punished for trying to make ends meet
4087822 if we put an end to prepayment penalties on subprime loans individuals trying to make their loans more payable will be more likely to keep their homes
4087823 by requiring lenders to include taxes and insurance potential homeowners can avoid being seduced by deceptively low payments
4087824 additionally it is important to require lenders to review borrowers to ensure they will be able to repay their loans
4087825 we should examine the impact that the housing rescue and foreclosure prevention act will have on the mortgage crisis
4087826 after reviewing its effectiveness the state can then fill in any remaining gaps
4087827 while home foreclosures have hit the eastside particularly hard all of indiana would benefit by addressing this problem
4087828 our state needs to step up its efforts to reduce the numbers of these foreclosures if elected i will aggressively seek to pass these proposals to shield homeowners from foreclosure and protect our communities from decreasing home values
4087829 one of the biggest concerns on the minds of everyone is foreclosure
4087830 people left in effected neighborhoods are seeing the values of their homes fall due to these vacancies something must be done
4087831 we are hearing stories of workers who are cold and hungry some arrive to find they will be crammed into houses sleeping many per room each having an exorbitant amount deducted from their pay for rent and power worse some arrive to find no roof over their heads

4087838 how to weave organizational principles into a more effective management system that respects the differences between strategy and operations yet integrates them in a powerful way
4087839 we dont advocate abandoning an intense focus on operations and their improvement

4087841 what we see as do many around the world is a global economy that is difficult

4087844 investors may read this negatively and will want to better understand if the company is being overly cautious or the outlook has slowed

4087960 the land which now comes to the market has already being designated and zoned by the government as future development land planning permission is anticipated on being achieved by 2010 so any investor now purchasing either quarter or half acre plots should anticipate returns of between 100 150 with an exit strategy forecast for the end of 2010 such are the potential levels of return on this investment that i doubt many other property or land investments come even close
4087961 playing against richie is something i always look forward to

4087967 deet has been shown to be an extremely safe and effective repellent
4087968 natural is a word that is sometimes used to promote safe products unfortunately the wording can be misleading for the uninformed individual natural products are usually essential oils distilled from plants these oils can be toxic and irritating in high concentrations natural repellents are not necessarily safe repellents
4087969 there is no scientific evidence that eating garlic vitamins onions or any other food will make a person repellent to mosquitoes
4087970 it is also unlikely that b 1 skin patches will work either
4087971 there is no evidence that wearing devices that emit sound will repel mosquitoes
4087972 bug zappers do not control mosquitoes and can reduce the populations of beneficial insects

4087995 in talks about making cars cleaner and more fuel efficient with engineers here ive asked whether a small turbine turning at a constant rate wouldnt be an ideal way to power the generator of an electric motor driven car alas the noise high rpm and heat are still expensive problems and turbines small enough to serve such a purpose are prohibitively expensive compared to existing alternatives such as small diesels
4087996 perhaps the biggest drawback is in fuel economy even though the engine itself is relatively efficient it operates at a high rpm even while at idle
4087997 dont anybody mention the word turbine here we have no idea what caused this car to blow up spilled fuel maybe it has nothing to do with the turbine powered car visiting in town

4088006 ive truly relished working with my longtime partner tom cruise to revitalize united artists and i am proud of all that weve accomplished in the past two years reinvigorating the brand and developing such a strong slate of films
4088007 but i always tell my sons follow your passion and ive got to follow that advice myself as much as ive enjoyed my time as an executive i have longed to return to my true love which is making movies so thats what ive decided to do

4088021 we need a government that transfers power to the elected representatives of the people to carry out the peoples mandate for change
4088022 he grabbed me on my throat hit me in my head
4088023 i started thinking of the last time he did that he suffocated me so i grabbed a knife and i stabbed him he was hitting me on my head cussing me telling me he was going to kill me
4088024 although she had engaged in some self injury to her arm no she did not meet those criteria
4088025 i was not able to contact the police and breach confidentiality
4088026 i can only do that when theres evidence that she intends serious injury to self or others
4088027 asked me did i know how to drive because he didnt want me to witness him killing her

4088104 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
4088105 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
4088106 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
4088107 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
4088108 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system
4088109 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
4088110 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
4088111 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
4088112 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
4088113 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
4088114 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
4088115 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
4088116 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
4088117 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
4088118 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
4088119 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
4088120 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
4088121 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
4088122 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
4088123 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
4088124 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
4088125 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
4088126 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
4088127 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
4088128 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
4088129 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
4088130 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
4088131 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
4088132 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
4088133 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
4088134 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
4088135 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
4088136 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
4088137 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
4088138 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
4088139 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
4088140 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
4088141 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
4088142 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
4088143 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
4088144 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
4088145 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
4088146 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
4088147 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
4088148 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
4088149 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
4088150 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation
4088151 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
4088152 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
4088153 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients

4088156 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children

4088165 i mean there were a lot of creepy crawlies the worst are the centipedes some people on the crew got bit but luckily nobody in the cast got bit the centipedes indigenous to the hawaiian soil apparently if they bite you give the same amount of pain as a bullet shot you have to go to the hospital its not fatal just incredibly painful
4088166 this man is so beautiful hes deep he talks from his spirit and he knows he is surrounded by morons hes going to usher and show them the way i thought that the whole idea was wildly controversial and that maybe i shouldnt take my act on the road

4088168 before that i had no idea what i was doing i just knew that i was going to be in special effects make up i was either going to be really sorry i did this movie or relatively happy that i participated in this

4088189 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
4088190 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
4088191 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor
4088192 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
4088193 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
4088194 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
4088195 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
4088196 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
4088197 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
4088198 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
4088199 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
4088200 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
4088201 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
4088202 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
4088203 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
4088204 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
4088205 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
4088206 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
4088207 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches
4088208 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
4088209 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
4088210 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
4088211 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
4088212 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
4088213 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
4088214 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
4088215 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
4088216 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
4088217 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
4088218 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
4088219 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
4088220 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
4088221 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
4088222 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
4088223 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
4088224 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
4088225 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
4088226 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
4088227 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
4088228 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
4088229 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
4088230 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
4088231 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
4088232 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
4088233 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
4088234 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
4088235 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
4088236 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
4088237 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
4088238 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
4088239 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
4088240 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
4088241 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
4088242 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
4088243 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
4088244 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
4088245 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
4088246 i have been meaning to ask you for a long time
4088247 where have you been going for the past month you have been running to the forest every night has anything been troubling you brother
4088248 but you would very much like to tell me i can see it in your face you know that i would keep your secret say it lakshmana
4088249 you must not tell anyone not even rama no especially not rama
4088250 for the past month i have been meeting someone in the forest
4088251 she is beauty in its truest form disfigured and scarred though her face may be the fires of agni himself could not compare to her passion she is the soul and spirit of love the embodiment of the freedom i have been seeking for so long
4088252 for years shatrughna i have been the one always overlooked the dog of rama and his wife i hold nothing against my brother you must understand but i do not wish to be bound to this life for long i want to be free of these duties i want to be known not as the brother of the king but as myself as lakshmana
4088253 surpanakha is the key shatrughna she speaks of liberty and of free thinking things that i had never even dreamed every word that comes from that lovely mouth is a treasure to me every smile every laugh more precious than gold
4088254 your enthusiasm is infectious my twin i do not approve of your choice but it is apparent to me that you are well and truly in love i cannot keep you from the path you have chosen in a sense lakshmana i am proud of you for trying to forge your own destiny i see that you are impatient to return to the forest very well go my brother i will keep your secret
4088255 you spend every night in the forest this is not unusual however this past month you have been returning to the palace i must admit that i was shocked my sister when you first walked through the palace gates without asking for gold or jewelry
4088256 but it is true you spend all your days and nights in the forest rarely returning to the palace i know not what you do while you are there i believe it would be better for us both if i remained ignorant why the change of heart
4088257 but vibishana i do not know how much longer i can keep this from you already you have noticed come quickly i shall tell you now no one must hear us
4088258 now sister will you tell me what you have been doing why did you lie to me
4088259 brother i was only attempting to protect my secret i did not wish to insult you in any way vibishana i have a secret i must tell you for siblings cannot keep their true selves from each other for long
4088260 what is it tell me i pray you that i am not kept in the dark any longer
4088261 brother do you remember the two princes of ayodhya who fought our brother and killed him
4088262 of course how could i forget them rama and lakshmana
4088263 these past nights i have been meeting the younger one in the forest lakshmana
4088264 ah but he is beautiful and the stories he tells those wonderful stories of his brothers and their lives in the palace there is nothing quite like it i recall those times in our childhood when life was perfect his stories make me long for those days when kuvera and ravana were allies and kumbakarna our protector against their mischievous tricks
4088265 this is wonderful i have not been able to correspond with my friends since the day of ramas coronation perhaps now you can give me news of their condition from what you have told me i gather they are well and happy i bid you tell lakshmana that i wish to renew my friendship with them if possible now go i have been keeping you from your friend for much too long
4088266 sister is it possible perhaps that you have fallen for this lakshmana
4088267 i do not love him as a woman loves her husband you know what i think about love brother love is only pleasure and i will take any form of love i can get from lakshmana be it the satisfaction of the flesh or the joys of simply speaking with a friend i could never love him in the way you might believe i do

4088271 i felt at times last season i deserved to play and i didnt and i think when i did play i did a good job
4088272 hopefully things will change for me and i will get more playing time its for me to prove that i deserve that so i will be working hard every day to show that
4088273 it affects us because its different from what weve been used to but i am really enjoying it
4088274 im taking on new challenges like a lot of us are there are always changes when a new manager comes in and its for us to work hard and do what he wants and put that on the pitch and thats what we will be trying to do
4088275 there have been changes and we have lost some players but we have brought in good quality players it will be an interesting season for us but we have got to be looking to break into europe
4088276 we are really looking forward to getting the premier league started i think weve had enough of pre season games and pre season training and nows the time to get the season going
4088277 things have gone really well we have had a good pre season i think the guys are in good shape
4088278 now shes a star so it was all worth it
4088279 mr potter has now been missing for more than two weeks and as time goes by we are becoming increasingly fearful regarding his well being it is possible he has travelled out of county durham and we would urge anyone who has any knowledge of his whereabouts to contact us immediately as far as we are aware he does not have the medication he needs with him and we have significant concerns for his welfare
4088280 sams family is jewish lindsay has learned a lot about judaism from sam and admires its beliefs
4088281 two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was alcoholics anonymous she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
4088282 lindsay is great but shes also 22 years old i think people forget that with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
4088283 even the airport security guy in canada asked me so is it true

4088287 across a broad spectrum of service delivery needs and budgetary challenges counties continue to develop improved service delivery options made possible by technology
4088288 if you want to do something routine there are several options
4088289 it also allows us to focus on people who have more complex questions need more time and want to deal with someone face to face
4088290 its a unique way of using it as a gateway back to us
4088291 for their aggressiveness in stretching the boundaries of the services they provide
4088292 the less people have to go to the county administration building and city hall the more time and resources they save by doing it from their home
4088293 government web sites used to be a static information source now they are more dynamic in the last few years governments have been using their web sites to rethink how they do business
4088294 who has a story about how they got here this morning
4088295 there was a lot more early stage talent and ideas than there were vehicles to get them going
4088296 we said theres really an opportunity to create a destination for cutting edge talent and ideas in this region
4088297 will the technology work and will the market emerge thats the quintessential question
4088298 is it going to work and is it going to matter
4088299 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
4088300 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
4088301 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
4088302 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4088303 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4088304 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know

4088307 im trying to get directions to somewhere to get to know you better
4088308 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
4088309 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
4088310 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
4088311 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
4088312 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
4088313 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
4088314 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
4088315 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
4088316 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
4088317 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
4088318 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
4088319 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
4088320 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
4088321 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
4088322 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
4088323 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
4088324 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
4088325 what we a found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
4088326 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy

4088330 companies are seeing the opportunity to use green to capture customers
4088331 were not going to read about a 3g iphone made from hemp
4088332 and although companies are touting innovations in making their devices more green third party groups still will say this isnt green at all

4088336 the special hearing date will allow the board to conclude the case that day and render its decision promptly
4088337 i think its time to air all these issues before the zoning board and let them make a decision
4088338 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
4088339 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
4088340 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
4088341 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
4088342 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
4088343 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
4088344 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
4088345 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
4088346 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
4088347 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
4088348 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
4088349 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
4088350 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
4088351 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
4088352 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
4088353 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
4088354 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
4088355 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
4088356 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
4088357 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
4088358 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
4088359 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
4088360 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
4088361 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
4088362 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
4088363 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
4088364 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
4088365 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
4088366 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
4088367 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
4088368 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
4088369 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
4088370 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
4088371 our study sheds new light on how that process works
4088372 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
4088373 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
4088374 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
4088375 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
4088376 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
4088377 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
4088378 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
4088379 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
4088380 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
4088381 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
4088382 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
4088383 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
4088384 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
4088385 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
4088386 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
4088387 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
4088388 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
4088389 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
4088390 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
4088391 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
4088392 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
4088393 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
4088394 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
4088395 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
4088396 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
4088397 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
4088398 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
4088399 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
4088400 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
4088401 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
4088402 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
4088403 finala va avea loc m ine de la ora 5 16 ora rom niei

4088409 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
4088410 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
4088411 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
4088412 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
4088413 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
4088414 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
4088415 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
4088416 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
4088417 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
4088418 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
4088419 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
4088420 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
4088421 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
4088422 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
4088423 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
4088424 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
4088425 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude

4088429 that means that the music industry in germany has no chance to find out the real address behind an ip address at the moment
4088430 the guidelines say that no investigation should be done if the damage is lower than 3000 euros approx 4 500
4088431 the guideline says that the damage of trading one song is 1 euro 1 50 that means that you could have 2999 files on your computer and the prosecutors will not investigate

4088440 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
4088441 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
4088442 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
4088443 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
4088444 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
4088445 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
4088446 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
4088447 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
4088448 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
4088449 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
4088450 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
4088451 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
4088452 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
4088453 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
4088454 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
4088455 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
4088456 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
4088457 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
4088458 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
4088459 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
4088460 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases
4088461 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
4088462 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
4088463 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
4088464 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
4088465 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
4088466 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
4088467 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
4088468 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
4088469 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
4088470 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
4088471 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
4088472 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
4088473 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
4088474 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
4088475 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
4088476 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
4088477 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
4088478 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
4088479 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
4088480 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
4088481 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
4088482 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
4088483 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
4088484 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
4088485 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
4088486 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
4088487 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
4088488 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
4088489 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
4088490 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
4088491 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
4088492 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
4088493 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
4088494 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
4088495 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
4088496 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
4088497 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
4088498 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
4088499 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
4088500 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
4088501 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
4088502 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
4088503 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
4088504 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
4088505 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
4088506 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
4088507 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
4088508 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
4088509 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
4088510 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
4088511 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
4088512 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
4088513 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
4088514 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
4088515 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
4088516 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
4088517 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
4088518 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
4088519 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
4088520 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
4088521 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
4088522 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
4088523 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
4088524 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
4088525 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
4088526 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
4088527 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
4088528 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
4088529 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine

4088534 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
4088535 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard

4088543 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service
4088544 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
4088545 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
4088546 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here

4088831 for decades al gore has challenged the skeptics in washington on climate change and awakened the conscience of a nation to the urgency of this threat i strongly agree with vice president gore that we cannot drill our way to energy independence but must fast track investments in renewable sources of energy like solar power wind power and advanced biofuels and those are the investments i will make as president its a strategy that will create millions of new jobs that pay well and cannot be outsourced and one that will leave our children a world that is cleaner and safer

4088833 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
4088834 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise

4088859 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
4088860 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

4088863 there is strong disagreement with many of the legal analytical economic science and policy interpretations
4088864 is a deeply flawed and unsuitable vehicle for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
4088865 will not only harm the us economy but will fail to provide an effective response to the global challenge of climate change as the president observed in april decisions with such far reaching impact should not be left to unelected regulators and judges
4088866 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
4088867 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
4088868 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
4088869 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
4088870 we want to jump on this bandwagon we have to
4088871 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
4088872 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
4088873 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
4088874 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
4088875 ministers have proven time and time again that they are not to be trusted with sensitive data but they seem intent on pressing ahead with this snoopers charter

4088886 the first is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength
4088887 you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
4088888 an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say to you do not resist an evildoer but if anyone strikes you on the right cheek turn the other also
4088889 with man this is impossible but with god all things are possible

4088903 responsible individuals throughout the industrialized world are trying to come to grips with the harm being done to the global environment
4088904 its absurd to think that women who want to get pregnant using complex technical procedures should get special treatment while those who want to get pregnant the old fashioned way lose their jobs just for trying it isnt right
4088905 if its okay for some women to invoke a law that allows them to try and get knocked up on company time then its certainly appropriate for all the rest and what about guys maybe a nooner isnt enough time for them to get lathered up and do their spouses they way they need doing its not only about the machinery you know procreation is complex and organic methods should be respected as much as high tech maybe more
4088906 the courts require businesses to provide special accommodations for the handicapped and opportunity for those who need assistance so that they can lead as normal a life as possible the court ruling is a reasonable one that allows women with difficulty becoming pregnant greater opportunity to become so
4088907 people who are not fertility challenged dont need to take work hours off for sex they can screw around on their own time but women who have difficulty getting pregnant need afternoons off for complicated sexual activity the court needs to provide them this opportunity and should also step in and allow illegal aliens freedom to roam america without hindrance and the u s should pay illegals to have sex if they want kids but are too busy trying to duck the immigration authorities this country needs to be more compassionate
4088908 there were a number of us there who saw them including taxi drivers and police community support officers the couple went on having sex for about 20 minutes
4088909 while the details of the incidents are still emerging we want to make it clear that unity takes this matter very seriously the two individuals concerned have been suspended pending a full investigation
4088910 we expect unity staff to share the same values and code of conduct as council colleagues and so are very concerned about these allegations
4088911 while government officials have been having sexual liaisons of all kinds in every place and with almost everyone they come in contact with i get nervous when they start mandating by law certain portions of the business day for sexual activity especially when its focused on women who fit a select type of criteria
4088912 bill was mandating time for sex in his office all the time and it became a legal and physical mess you let the courts and government officials start legislating what time of day americans should be having sex and what women should be having it and im telling you itll get out of hand bill already hopes to influence new legislation by promoting an amendment to the big bang theory this is trouble im telling you

4088968 we must lower gas prices and a chicken in every pot for every voting american
4088969 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
4088970 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
4088971 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
4088972 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
4088973 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
4088974 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
4088975 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
4088976 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4088977 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4088978 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4088979 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4088980 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4088981 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4088982 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4088983 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4088984 echo barack obamas call for a new economy with new energy

4088988 de facto slogan has become real men dont think things through
4088989 every day that the campaign is about race is a good day for john mccain
4088990 he doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
4088991 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4088992 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4088993 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4088994 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4088995 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4088996 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4088997 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
4088998 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers

4089010 thousands of people have seen their community facilities stolen or damaged by thieves looking for a quick gain
4089011 we consider this video though it names no one to be a photographic list of an anti semitic nature and therefore liable to criminal prosecution
4089012 the world must open its eyes to the plight of us tibetans rather than focusing on the beijing olympics
4089013 i will continue to protest unless china guarantees human rights in tibet

4089017 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4089018 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4089019 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4089020 look john kerry has been vetted he ran for president i think he would be a strong choice hed be a good choice especially in the context of foreign policy
4089021 a weaker economy soaring gas prices growing dependence on foreign oil and a worsening climate crisis
4089022 theres a bold new solution for all of these challenges
4089023 join the more than one million people who are already demanding we switch on a brighter future
4089024 the olympics are a time for all americans to reflect on our nations achievements and what we as a people can do together
4089025 choosing the right path and re powering our nation is something we can do and something that will benefit us all
4089026 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4089027 i also agree that the worlds problems arent caused by global warming
4089028 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
4089029 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
4089030 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
4089031 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
4089032 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
4089033 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
4089034 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
4089035 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
4089036 a career legacy politician who fell hook line and sinker for the administrations case for a disastrous war and dragged much of our party with him would undermine both
4089037 we only do 60 cities that leaves me 300 days a year to do something else
4089038 whatever i wrote last year is what i recorded this year
4089039 if the world needs savin and the polar caps are melting shouldnt we all check in and see if were destroying this sucker
4089040 its amazing that i can sell 35 million albums and have 50 million spins as a writer and one three minute song carries more weight than all of that combined
4089041 first of all you cant go make everyone understand what you do
4089042 now two years after that song comes out we go into iraq now all of a sudden im responsible for the iraq war i cant go tell everybody to listen to the words and tell them i have nothing to do with the iraq war my philosophy on that is i think we need to take care of afghanistan and get osama bin laden but im not going to apologize for being patriotic and wherever the troops go ill go there and play
4089043 i dont think anyone should listen to what stupid celebrities say if someone endorsing someone is going to change the way you vote then youre not taking advantage of your american right here everybody needs to educate themselves and vote the best they can
4089044 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making

4089046 there is widespread support in the population for our fight to protect our environment which we saw during the signature collecting campaign
4089047 its the equivalent of 4 200 football parks together they would form a line from bern to paris
4089048 more than a quarter of the designated territory for building purposes is not developed but nevertheless more land is put aside by the communes
4089049 it is similar to a regulation on the use of forests in switzerland clearings are only allowed if the same surface is re forested elsewhere
4089050 at present the communes are in competition with each other and give financial incentives to attract investors this is detrimental to the environment
4089051 sparsely populated regions featuring extensive estates of detached housing unstructured industrial and business zones shopping centres and leisure areas with enormous car parks
4089052 countryside losing its rural character without having gained urban qualities
4089053 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4089054 higher superstition the academic left and its quarrels with science

4089056 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4089057 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4089058 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4089059 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4089060 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4089061 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4089062 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4089063 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4089064 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4089065 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4089066 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4089067 this is being done in a friendly and straightforward way
4089068 it is also all about what we can do to reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gases
4089069 these are all small things and they all add up
4089070 when you connect the dots it turns out that the real solutions to the climate crisis are the very same measures needed to renew our economy and escape the trap of ever rising energy prices
4089071 because the sun doesnt shine and the wind doesnt blow all the time
4089072 the country is not going to be able to go cold turkey
4089073 we have a hundred years of infrastructure with trillions of dollars of investment that is not simply going to be made obsolete
4089074 around two dozen convicts affiliated with various political and criminal armed outfits in southern nepal have fled
4089075 weve caught five of them the rest of the fugitives are still at large and we have intensified our search
4089076 our dangerous over reliance on carbon based fuels is at the core of all three of these challenges the economic environmental and national security crises
4089077 the answer is simple to power our country with 100 clean energy in ten years all we need is your help
4089078 without the slightest doubt the technology for a hydrogen economy exists or can be developed in reasonable time
4089079 the problem of maximizing power from sunlight has been known for at least 30 years and is primarily one of physical limitations not engineering technology
4089080 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
4089081 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
4089082 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
4089083 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
4089084 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
4089085 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
4089086 id love to have breakfast with you just the three of us without cameras and lights and tell you why i feel so strongly about this
4089087 utopians in the american vein who both believed in power but bridges wanted to see it redistributed abram wanted to see it concentrated
4089088 he gore has been working on this global warming business for decades the country and world caught up to him
4089089 would you offer him a job in an obama administration
4089090 clinton dispatched the military overseas forty four times during his eight years the u s military had been deployed outside of america only eight times in the previous forty five years
4089091 clinton acting through nato also orchestrated a bombing campaign against serbia from march until june 1999
4089092 he did so without the consent of congress the house of representatives actually voted against authorizing clintons bombing war against the serbs no president in american history has ever waged war in the face of direct congressional opposition
4089093 its the first big unequivocal test about what this possible president really thinks
4089094 youve got to be sure that you get the right person the person has got to be of presidential stature has got to be someone you can be comfortable with work with and help you as president compatibility is very crucial
4089095 the chemistry between us had been correct but not warm
4089096 you dont want it to be a reason for people to question your judgment
4089097 seven words that can change the world reveals the astonishing simple truths that have the power to forever transform our world for the better while freeing our minds from the enslavement of limiting beliefs this is not a text for the simple minded it is a guiding philosophy for the mindful intelligent few who are wise enough to seek out and recognize the higher simplicities of truly purposeful living
4089098 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4089099 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4089100 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
4089101 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
4089102 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
4089103 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
4089104 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
4089105 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4089106 john and i will tell you there were interesting races four years ago and eight years ago but in many ways this is one of the most interesting races in all of american history we have a chance to lift our country to a new way of thinking this can be a transformative election but make no mistake its close closer than it should be
4089107 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
4089108 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
4089109 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
4089110 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
4089111 just so you all know we did set a record
4089112 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
4089113 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
4089114 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
4089115 the voter registration officials simply take the word of the registrant with no follow up
4089116 some states that require some backup documentation merely ask for a utility bill or a drivers license neither of which prove citizenship in other words legal or illegal aliens can easily register to vote in local and national elections
4089117 while the news media perpetuated the assertion that bush and the gop stole the election it could very well have been illegal aliens voting in florida that made the outcome so close
4089118 bush may have beaten gore by more votes if illegals were excluded since immigrants tend to vote for democrats or gore could have won decisively had there been prior screening before people were allowed into the voting booths
4089119 there was absolutely no mention in the mainstream media regarding suspected voter fraud by illegal or legal aliens it was much easier for the agenda driven newspeople to accuse republicans of stealing the election
4089120 florida is not unique thousands of non citizens are registered to vote in some states and tens if not hundreds of thousands in total may be present on the voter rolls nationwide these numbers are significant local elections are often decided by only a handful of votes and even national elections have likely been within the margin of the number of non citizens illegally registered to vote
4089121 there is no reliable method to determine the number of non citizens registered or actually voting because most laws to ensure that only citizens vote are ignored are inadequate or are systematically undermined by government officials those who ignore the implications of non citizen registration and voting either are willfully blind to the problem or may actually favor this form of illegal voting
4089122 americans would be shocked to discover that hundreds of thousands of general election voters are illegal aliens green card immigrants and criminals whove murdered raped and robbed us citizens and guess which political party benefits the most from their votes the one thats pushing for amnesty and a bag full of free goodies
4089123 to keep non citizens from diluting citizens votes immigration and election officials must cooperate far more effectively than they have to date and state and federal officials must increase their efforts to enforce the laws against non citizen voting that are already on the books
4089124 while the liberal media and the liberal establishment ignore what is a huge scandal american voters are having their rights violated when an illegal aliens or felon or other person prohibited by law to vote their votes cancels out those of american citizens
4089125 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
4089126 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
4089127 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4089128 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4089129 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4089130 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4089131 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4089132 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4089133 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4089134 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4089135 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4089136 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4089137 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4089138 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4089139 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4089140 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4089141 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4089142 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4089143 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4089144 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4089145 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4089146 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4089147 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4089148 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4089149 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4089150 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4089151 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4089152 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4089153 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4089154 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4089155 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4089156 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4089157 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4089158 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4089159 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4089160 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4089161 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4089162 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4089163 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4089164 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4089165 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4089166 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4089167 this boat is going to be the toyota prius of the houseboat business
4089168 it is the most eco friendly houseboat anywhere in the country

4089172 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
4089173 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
4089174 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
4089175 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
4089176 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
4089177 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
4089178 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
4089179 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
4089180 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4089181 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4089182 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4089183 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech

4089193 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year

4089197 a test taker having taken many many many standardized exams when its too specific you have to be wary
4089198 after i had seen three or four quizzes i kind of knew how the questions were going to be so i would write quiz questions down and then write the answer i wanted to give so i would memorize the questions and answers i wanted to give therefore i could be as fast as possible because i already knew the answer i wanted to give nine times out of 10 i would come up with the quiz questions
4089199 i read really really fast like i said i could anticipate the questions so when they would give the questions i already knew what the answers were going to be in my head there it goes on top of that im quick with my hands good hands lead to coordination it always helps

4089209 on setting up diplomatic relations between the two countries at the level of ambassadors
4089210 one of the steps that has long been required is the establishment of a proper embassy for syria in lebanon and vice versa
4089211 now if the syrians will go ahead and demarcate the border between lebanon and syria and respect lebanons sovereignty in other ways then this will have proved to be a very good step
4089212 to reactivate the work of the joint committee to demarcate the lebanese syrian borders within a mechanism and a set of priorities
4089213 it is not possible to mark the borders in shebaa farms as long as there is still israeli occupation the occupation must end

4089229 im sorry if anybody thought or took it the wrong way and thought that it was offensive
4089230 this was clearly inappropriate but we understand the spanish team intended no offense and has apologized

4089243 taking part in training in buildings they have not been in before will also give the dogs a new challenge
4089244 one can forget about any talk about georgias territorial integrity because i believe it is impossible to persuade south ossetia and abkhazia to agree with the logic that they can be forced back into the georgian state
4089245 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
4089246 on the way to edinburgh i stopped off in london to cremate my mother in law

4089248 local politicians become adept at holding out their hands palm upwards the skills thus valued are how to fill in forms and how to spin a convincing tale of woe and continuing need

4089258 todays competition was very hard i had to to face three south koreans all the best in the world
4089259 but i was ready to challenge them each of them the gold is just a reward and encouragement for chinese involved in the sport of archery
4089260 the honor is not just for me but for all those related to the sport many years efforts from our team resulted in the gold medal
4089261 to my victory i think thats for the sake of the cheers from my home crowd
4089262 my confidence and composure also played an important role for that
4089263 silver is good i value my silver but it would be a lie if i say no regret of course im regretful i need to get better prepared for next time
4089264 of course its the winner always has the say i do regret of the result i think i can break those archers before me but not this time its a good experience for me and for other south korean archers in the future
4089265 its ok not to win in this way the newcomers will get less pressurized our archers in south korea will compete in better mental conditions and get better results
4089266 in the past four years ive been preparing for this now its over but bronze fell short of my expectation for 2012 olympics in london i need to win more than bronze medal if i am going there
4089267 our team at roost takes great care to roll out new markets and were confident that these new market listings will live up to the best in class user experience that home seekers count on
4089268 even though the new england market may have been hibernating of late there is a lot of desirable inventory available by using roost we know users will be better armed to make smart decisions in their home buying quest
4089269 roost is a fantastic service for home buyers home sellers and agents in new england

4089279 as part of social security reform i believe that private savings accounts are a part of it along the lines of what president bush proposed
4089280 mccain has been especially supportive of his onetime rival appearing with bush at three events over the past two days in trying to prod democrats into negotiations to include private accounts in a plan to revamp social security
4089281 private savings accounts work they have been proven to work not only in but all over the world and we ought to really strongly support it
4089282 privatizing social security be a priority for you going forward
4089283 without privatization i dont see how you can possibly over time make sure that young americans are able to receive social security benefits

4089291 i am president of the volleyball federation and i know its better to stay here

4089341 director general pascal lamy in his remarks on the second day of the global partnership for development conference in new delhi on 13 august 2008 said that the doha round should not collapse over the issue of the special safeguard mechanism in agriculture for developing countries a fine balance is required and the search for this fine balance requires that our negotiating resources continue at work he added
4089342 safeguards are defined as contingency restrictions on imports taken temporarily to deal with special circumstances such as a surge in imports
4089343 they are not a new concept safeguards that applied to all products were included in the general agreement on tariffs and trade gatt and there is a safeguards agreement in the uruguay round agreement that created the wto
4089344 the doha round would create a third type the special safeguard mechanism ssm but only for developing countries not eligible to use the ssg because they did not switch from quotas to tariffs under the uruguay agreement like the ssg it could be triggered if the import surge or price decline is big enough without any need to test injury negotiate compensation or have previously converted to a tariff it could not be used if another safeguard was used on the product most of this had already been hashed out
4089345 the point of contention was using the ssm to increase tariffs above the bound tariffs commitments made in the uruguay round or for new members like china above the rates committed to when joining the wto this is where basic philosophy entered the debate
4089346 attempts at a compromise were based on allowing tariffs to go above the pre doha round commitments but constraining them by establishing additional criteria these included a minimum increase in imports ranging from 15 to 40 limits on how high the tariff could rise above the current bound maximum to 15 of the post doha bound rate or 15 percentage points whichever is higher as in the 10 july draft and how many products could exceed the pre doha tariff levels in a year such as 2 5 of products consensus could not be reach on these numbers
4089347 the downside risk to growth expectations in the current fiscal year is primarily from a further deterioration in global conditions in such areas as oil prices or capital markets the report said
4089348 domestically aside from the plethora of challenges already on the table there is also some danger on the food price inflation front
4089349 a tight monetary stance is necessary and coordinated policy actions can bring inflation down to between 8 and 9 this fiscal year the report said
4089350 indias inflation rate for the week ended july 26 rose to 12 01 from a year earlier slightly above 11 98 the previous week
4089351 u s agriculture secretary ed schafer said on tuesday the united states should end the ethanol import tariff but not abruptly because the u s ethanol industry has become reliant on it
4089352 congress extended a 54 cent per gallon tariff on ethanol imports until 2010 against the wishes of president bush the tariff has limited u s ethanol imports from countries with extensive biofuel programs such as brazil which produces 27 5 billion liters of ethanol annually
4089353 schafer said he still supports abolishing the tariff but the u s ethanol industry would need time to adjust if the current policy changed
4089354 federal law requires 9 billion gallons of ethanol to be blended with gasoline in 2008 increasing to 15 billion in 2015 and then 36 billion gallons in 2022 the mandate limits corn based ethanol to 12 billion gallons annually with all additional ethanol coming from other feedstocks
4089355 schafer said u s farmers would be able to produce enough corn to meet the mandates requirements because of rising corn yields
4089356 private u s ethanol company poet on wednesday said it will begin making a small amount of next generation ethanol later this year using crop waste a feedstock that could yield the alternative motor fuel without inflating food prices
4089357 poet the countrys top ethanol producer has started building a cellulosic ethanol pilot plant in scotland south dakota that will be added to an existing plant that makes traditional ethanol from corn ceo jeff broin told an ethanol conference on wednesday
4089358 the plant will have the capacity to make only a tiny bit of the fuel about 20 000 gallons per year but that number could grow if the plant helps the company learn how to spread the process to some or all of its 23 other ethanol distilleries
4089359 companies are racing to make cellulosic ethanol to help boost production of domestic fuel that could be lower in greenhouse emissions
4089360 cellulosic ethanol can be made from breaking down the tough woody bits of plants into sugars which are then fermented into fuel the process takes more steps than traditional ethanol so at the moment it is more expensive and the fuel is not made commercially
4089361 ethanol producers on wednesday railed against what they described as a smear campaign by opponents who have branded the industry responsible for rising food prices
4089362 today we face strong opposition and their weapon primarily is the press bob scott president of the american coalition for ethanol told hundreds of producers gathered in omaha for the groups trade show
4089363 but the ethanol industry has been hurt over the past year by criticism that linked the corn based fuel to rising food prices food companies cattle organizations and others have suggested that ethanol production was the main reason for higher corn prices
4089364 scott said the facts support the ethanol industrys view that the recent spike in energy prices is the biggest factor in food price increases
4089365 to help the ethanol industry fight its critics the coalition plans to launch a new social networking web site so ethanol producers can share information and the trade group will also offer a package of proposed laws that ethanol producers can try to get enacted in their home states
4089366 he criticized the oil and grocery industries for spreading misinformation that corn based ethanol has boosted grocery costs and wastes energy and water
4089367 we have the fuel for the revolution and its not just the ethanol that we produce and that we market he said its in the power the faith and the spirit of the people in this room
4089368 about 1 200 people farmers renewable energy experts and people working in the ethanol industry are attending the american coalition for ethanol conference at qwest center omaha the event includes a trade fair featuring about 200 businesses that serve the ethanol industry
4089369 it was standing room only for sessions focusing on cellulosic ethanol a fuel created by breaking down the fibers of grass corncobs or other biological materials
4089370 the recent plunge in corn and soybean prices and the cost of fuel to transport products to stores will not bring relief to soaring u s food prices this year agriculture secretary ed schafer told reuters on tuesday
4089371 food prices are forecast to rise by 5 percent this year the largest annual increase since 1990 in its first estimate for 2009 the u s agriculture department said prices would rise by 4 5 percent led by higher costs of red meat and poultry
4089372 a broad range of commodities posted record high prices this year
4089373 despite the declines schafer said he did not anticipate prices going down from usdas forecast for 2008
4089374 in its first estimate of the fall harvest a corn crop of 12 288 billion bushels the second largest on record soybeans at 2 973 billion bushels the no 4 crop wheat at 2 462 billion bushels and cotton at 13 77 million bales weighing 480 lbs 218 kg the smallest in a decade
4089375 i think it helps it takes some of the pressure off food prices said private consultant keith collins
4089376 ephraim leibtag usdas food price expert said the forecasts will just reinforce a downturn in crop prices
4089377 if these food commodities and energy costs continue to decline that should take some of the pressure off of retail food prices said leibtag
4089378 large u s corn and soybean plantings will be needed in 2009 to rebuild soybean stockpiles and satisfy rising demand for corn by livestock feeders foodmakers and the ethanol industry
4089379 there will be a repeat in one sense of what we faced this spring said chief usda economist joe glauber to usdas radio service
4089380 u s cotton production is expected to drop to 13 8 million bales the lowest level since 1989
4089381 since farmers brought in 23 9 million bales in 2005 the countrys total cotton production has fallen steadily only three states alabama oklahoma and virginia are expected to see increases in production this year based on aug 1 conditions the report says production in south carolina is expected to be unchanged
4089382 current soybean prices are off dramatically from their peak last month
4089383 there are multiple contributors to the price decline mild summer weather has reduced the risk premium that is normally built into soybean prices at this time of year another source of market calming is the apparent settlement of a months long dispute over argentine export taxes that should let the countrys exports return to normal also market forces external to the supply and demand for crops are influencing recent price changes one is the highly volatile petroleum market in august 2007 the spot price for crude petroleum at domestic producers west texas intermediate was 72 36 per barrel the july 2008 average price was up to 133 37 with daily values peaking as high as 145 by early august however the oil price was sliding below 120 per barrel the recent decline has helped spark an appreciation of the u s dollar in foreign exchange markets to its highest level this year that has also eased the inflationary pressure on u s agricultural prices in addition congressional hearings on the regulation of futures market trading practices some of which are deemed a source of excess price volatility may have influenced current positions of investment funds
4089384 senators tom harkin and chuck grassley of iowa are leading 23 of their senate colleagues in an effort to ensure a provision in the farm bill is implemented to congress intent
4089385 the letter comes after complaints about the u s department of agricultures interpretation of a provision that would eliminate producers from receiving direct counter cyclical or acre payments if the farm is 10 acres or less
4089386 congress acted and streamlined usdas process in administering payments to small farms said harkin chairman of the senate committee on agriculture nutrition and forestry
4089387 the new farm law bars producers from receiving direct countercyclical or average crop revenue election payments if their farm consists of 10 or fewer base acres however the report accompanying the bill says the mangers intend for the department to
4089388 grassley harkin and the other senators wrote in their letter to schafer that it was congresss intent that small farmers be allowed to combine their acres if they had not done it in the past
4089389 but usda spokesman keith williams said today the secretary notes that had congress intended to require that they would have put it into law and they didnt
4089390 williams added if congress wants to change the law and require us to consolidate the farms then we will do it

4089398 this is just another thinly veiled attempt by an outside attack machine to smear congressman knollenberg and his record
4089399 were still making a decision whether itll be both tv and radio wed like to do both
4089400 throughout his career in washington he has opposed modest animal welfare reforms including efforts to halt horse slaughter for foreign consumption stop the processing of animals who are too sick or injured to walk to slaughter and pose a greater threat of spreading mad cow disease stop wealthy american trophy hunters from shooting threatened polar bears in the arctic stop the trophy shooting of bears over piles of grease and jelly doughnuts on national forests and other federal lands stop the use of steel jawed leghold traps and wire neck snares on national wildlife refuges inhumane and unsporting practices opposed by responsible hunters and protect dolphins from drowning in tuna nets
4089401 although he claims to be a fiscal conservative knollenberg voted to use tax dollars to promote the trophy hunting of elephants in africa and to give a 2 million annual subsidy to the luxury mink coat industry he voted twice to spend millions of dollars to kill predators with cruel traps and poisons as a government subsidy for private ranchers and he sought to de fund the u s department of agricultures enforcement of the federal law to combat animal fighting the same law that was later used to break up michael vicks dogfighting ring

4089413 we are still learning about the kinds of regulations and standards that are required
4089414 if we can meet the eu standards we can sell our food products to anywhere in the world
4089415 we still cannot export to the eu market because they require that the cambodian government fulfils certain inspection requirements to comply with their standards
4089416 as long as cambodias system for fisheries production and processing is not recognised no exports can take place
4089417 the problem is therefore not one of a particular product failing to meet specific standards but one of the system as a whole failing to meet the system requirements
4089418 the delay in taking action will only give the thais an opportunity to stay longer on cambodian lands

4089431 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4089432 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
4089433 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
4089434 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4089435 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4089436 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4089437 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4089438 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4089439 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4089440 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4089441 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4089442 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4089443 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4089444 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4089445 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4089446 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4089447 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4089448 who are open to doing something on the production side
4089449 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4089450 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4089451 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4089452 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4089453 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4089454 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4089455 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4089456 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4089457 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4089458 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4089459 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4089460 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4089461 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4089462 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4089463 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4089464 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4089465 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4089466 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
4089467 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
4089468 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
4089469 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
4089470 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4089471 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4089472 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4089473 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4089474 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4089475 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4089476 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4089477 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4089478 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4089479 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4089480 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4089481 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4089482 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4089483 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4089484 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4089485 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4089486 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4089487 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4089488 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4089489 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4089490 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4089491 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4089492 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4089493 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4089494 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4089495 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4089496 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4089497 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
4089498 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
4089499 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4089500 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4089501 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4089502 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
4089503 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
4089504 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
4089505 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
4089506 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
4089507 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
4089508 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4089509 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4089510 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4089511 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4089512 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4089513 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4089514 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4089515 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country

4089603 whilst operators understandably dont want to be perceived as trying to unfairly glean excess revenues from unwitting subscribers while abroad taking a one size fits all approach blocking their usage while abroad will result in them losing very significant revenues at a time when you would expect them to be looking to maximise their 3g network investments

4089844 we believe apple will sell 1 78 million units at its u s retail stores and 0 90 million phones at u s at amp t locations
4089845 our estimate assumes each of the 2 200 at amp t stores will sell an average of 5 phones per day from the july 11th launch through the end of the september quarter
4089846 we believe that our revision may be conservative and that apple will meet our estimates
4089847 the august 22nd launch in additional countries should provide another catalyst to sales
4089848 a decision on a piece of hardware like that would potentially be deployed conservatively to 200 000 people you know its a big decision especially when you have an existing fleet out there but its definitely something we are considering from a hsbc group perspective we always explore the potential application of new technologies and this is no different

4089867 you are supposed to be in china covering the games
4089868 the chinese government lied through its teeth about human rights arent the ioc ashamed
4089869 we are proud of the fact that these games are progressing with spectacular sport in spectacular venues
4089870 suppose i go to the israelites and say to them the god of your fathers has sent me to you and they ask me what is his name because they thought the name of god was so sacred they wouldnt even say it outloud or write it fully now thats respect plus also moses didnt really want to go so he was stalling moses continues then what shall i tell them
4089871 i am who i am this is what you are to say to the israelites i am has sent me to you
4089872 to be to become to come to pass to be done to happen to be finished
4089873 i advocate federalism as a way to gain lasting peace in mindanao
4089874 this concentration of such enormous powers in manila has created only one center of finance and development in the country resulting in a highly centralized system of government
4089875 is the absence or utter lack of consultation of stakeholders including christian leaders indigenous peoples in mindanao and peace advocates themselves
4089876 contravenes the very essence of any peace process which is participative of the stakeholders
4089877 the offer reflects a significant premium and a strong value for unitholders as well as providing an excellent liquidity opportunity that the board of trustees fully and enthusiastically supports
4089878 we are proud of the team that has been built over the last 14 years and are excited to be leading them into the next phase of the companys growth and development supported by a great set of financial partners
4089879 whilst flushing a toilet may not be a nuisance plainly it may be so if it is done repeatedly and at anti social hours

4089883 i feel sorry for liu yan my heart is full of regrets
4089884 im deeply sorry liu yan is a heroine she sacrificed a lot for the olympics for me for the opening ceremony
4089885 i regret many things many details of this performance many things i could have done better
4089886 for example there are performers who were injured i blame myself for that it might well have been avoided if i had given more detailed instructions
4089887 they were here to do business not to attack the olympics
4089888 the worlds opinion was increasingly becoming skeptical about organized terrorism so the government is trying to prove that it is a real threat

4089897 i have to figure out how to set the stage
4089898 its changed the dynamics of getting confirmed sightings on wildlife for biologists

4089900 the clubs sustainability depends on its investors and directors managing the companys affairs as a sensible business
4089901 we await news of what the arkaga fund as investors in cork city investment fc ltd intend to do
4089902 first of all weve been waiting for this game for the last two years
4089903 im pretty sure im sick and tired and they are sick and tired of hearing about greece but we just got to approach it as another game another team thats in our way for the gold medal
4089904 i remember that we missed a ton of free throws 14 of their 34
4089905 and the pick and roll game we couldnt adjust to the pick and roll game by the time we adjusted the game was over
4089906 i was stunned if you can see the footage from that game i didnt want to get off the court after the game
4089907 her dad was understandably shocked when she called from vegas and told him she was getting married he had all the questions about max that any father would
4089908 but peaches was defiant reassured him he was a really nice lad who went to harvard and was not into drugs she basically said she was doing it anyway and that she hoped she could have his support
4089909 bob realised she was going to get hitched anyway he said on this one youre on your own youve made your bed and now you lie in it
4089910 bob told her that shes 19 now that she lives away from home and is old enough to learn from the decisions she makes
4089911 he told her there would be massive flak from the newspapers but she just said it would be good for her career peaches said she knew what she was doing that marriage was a step towards stability
4089912 she didnt miss out the chance to remind him that her and her mum had a rock and roll wedding in vegas
4089913 the bottom line is that bob said he would be there to pick up the pieces if it all went wrong but all that has made peaches even more determined to make the marriage work
4089914 i see him all the time at least once a week
4089915 we still have feelings for each other i still love him and i think he loves me
4089916 we were both really attracted to each other he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
4089917 you never knew if they were broken up or not because it changed from day to day
4089918 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years they were a really tight couple but i think it was hard for kelli having jamie lynn in the picture
4089919 like a dagger going through my heart it hurt so bad
4089920 he thought she was just saying she was pregnant to get him back because at that point they were broken up once again he told me it wasnt true and not to worry
4089921 at no point did he say kelli shes pregnant we cant do this anymore its not right we would hang out and hook up
4089922 i dont know where jamie lynn thought he was he probably said he was just going out with the guys but really he was coming to be with me
4089923 he had to deal with the baby coming and it had to stop but even after we stopped we would still kiss occasionally
4089924 i think that he is trapped when i see jamie lynn doing interviews and talking about how happy she is with casey it seems so fake shes trying to paint a pretty picture but its messy art
4089925 i want the best for him i would never trap him into a life with me i would want casey to be with me for the right reasons because he wanted to
4089926 these past weeks have shown us clearly that senator collins is not concerned with the tone of third party ads so long as they attack tom allen we are now seeing another round of television ads in a campaign that distorts tom allens record while portraying maines working men and women as members of organized crime
4089927 on the issue this ad has brought up sen collins does not support the employee free choice act and she believes that all workers are entitled to a secret ballot on this ad she finds it ironic that a public servant elected by a private ballot would vote to deny union employees the same right
4089928 it is understandable that people in maine who have missed out on the nations economic boom might want to artificially increase their incomes through collective bargaining the problem is that unless those jobs are creating added value there is no extra money to go around if the card check bill were to become law and increased the number and clout of unions it would drive up the cost of living for all of us while providing no measurable benefit
4089929 majority sign up is much faster than the government run balloting process and leaves less time for employers to harass and intimidate workers so they will back off from joining a union
4089930 this is something thats done in unions all across the country
4089931 the reality is that if you look at the voting records and questionnaires weve received from the candidates the issues that our members tell us they care about like health insurance benefits and wages democrats have been much more supportive
4089932 it was one of the ways the budget was balanced
4089933 theres been enough interest in it each year that it has been maintained
4089934 i think the employer should not be asking what youre doing on your free time whether theyre sunning themselves in hawaii or going to be working for a political candidate in a union setting we would find it very offensive
4089935 weve saved him some money by having somebody not work
4089936 during this tough economic time a yearly pay reduction of 250 to 500 for an unplanned unauthorized payroll deduction could spell disaster for many families
4089937 when hired as an employee of the las virgenes unified school district no employee was instructed it was mandatory to pay an agency fee to lvca
4089938 the issue has nothing to do with the administration or the board
4089939 im not going to back down i can tell you that
4089940 after receiving cash from various sources della porta allegedly deposited less cash than the union received and pocketed the balance
4089941 we didnt know what was wrong and we called our accountants
4089942 they said its a very skilled person who can do that
4089943 but im very glad that the department of labor has finally concluded its investigation and has decided to take action against her
4089944 this ruling is a positive first step towards clearing our companys good name
4089945 through this lawsuit we hope to once and for all put an end to the ugly and malicious lies that the ufcw has spread about our company and our members employees through its slick negative campaigning
4089946 the ufcw has said that it intends to either extort bashas into surrendering to its campaign or destroy bashas as a viable business
4089947 in pursuit of that scheme the ufcw and its operatives have repeatedly delivered false and defamatory statements about bashas treatment of its members the health and cleanliness of its grocery stores and bashas regard for and treatment of hispanic customers and employees this ruling allows bashas the right to protect itself from the ufcws extortion
4089948 this is what bashas has been saying all along that hungry for respect is nothing more than an empty store front for the ufcw
4089949 its all about franken and it needs to be all about coleman
4089950 rush limbaugh is a big fat idiot and other observations
4089951 lies and the lying liars who tell them a fair and balanced look at the right
4089952 it kills me that things i said and wrote sent a message that they cant count on me to be a champion for women for all minnesotans im sorry for that because thats not who i am
4089953 i wrote a lot of jokes some of them werent funny some of them werent appropriate some of them were downright offensive i understand that
4089954 not paying taxes going without insurance for his employees foul mouthed attacks on anyone he disagrees with tasteless sexist jokes writing all that juicy porn
4089955 its the total package we kind of call it the new york city problem
4089956 the root of it is that hes been out of touch with minnesota for so long that he didnt understand that we dont talk like that here
4089957 were putting every resource into helping him beat norm coleman and take back paul wellstones seat in november
4089958 norm coleman has been working on behalf of minnesotans for 30 years hes led a minnesota life
4089959 is someone who parachuted in from out of state to run for office
4089960 he just really believed there was a red line between that past and running for office
4089961 consorzio di 8 piccoli wine produttori di langa e roero
4089962 here we are in 2008 and its early august and were already seeing problems
4089963 im very concerned that were going to see more problems throughout 2008
4089964 they wanted to go out and get 20 cards in an hour and just be done with it
4089965 this is the very reason i have fought for photo id in order to receive a ballot
4089966 we have added more names on the voter rolls and we still have no idea if the person that is handed the ballot is truly that person
4089967 unfortunately the gop will use any excuse to call for the use of voter id
4089968 if it rains too hard theyll say its because people arent required to show their drivers licenses when they vote
4089969 someone tried to game the system and those people were caught
4089970 part of our mission was to hire out of that community
4089971 so you tend to get people who are a little less educated
4089972 while acorn may have reported it themselves i dont think theres any question that they felt like eventually they were going to be caught so maybe it would be better to report it now and throw themselves at the mercy of the authorities
4089973 the reality is the democrats i think believe they benefit more from people who potentially wouldnt be eligible to vote being under less scrutiny
4089974 we look at the rules as they are whether we like them or not we wish there was a photo id requirement there isnt we wish that there were other reforms to the system that we dont have
4089975 with the systems of checks and balances in place including our statewide voter registration anyone who tries to do something like that will get caught
4089976 we have a great level of participation in wisconsin because of election day registration and many states are following our lead
4089977 we believe in voter enfranchisement we think its a good thing
4089978 and the reason i say that isnt because ive got a whole bunch of proof to throw in your lap today the reason i say it is the historical trends here in presidential races in the last three cycles
4089979 if you have a total swing of 4 000 or 5 000 votes that could make a difference in a statewide election
4089980 i would challenge anyone making that claim to show me actual cases in which people actually did vote fraudulently
4089981 thats like saying we should outlaw driving because someone might speed
4089982 the most frequently reported side effects in persons receiving hepatitis b vaccine are pain at the injection site 3 29 and temperature of gt
4089983 on the basis of vsd data the estimated incidence of anaphylaxis among children and adolescents who received hepatitis b vaccine is one case per 1
4089984 each year rotavirus causes approximately 111 million episodes of gastroenteritis requiring only home care 25 million clinic visits 2 million hospitalizations and 352 000 592 000 deaths 4
4089985 this vaccine will prevent 74 percent of all rotavirus cases about 98 percent of severe cases and about 96 percent of hospitalizations due to rotavirus
4089986 children are slightly 1 to 3 percent more likely to have mild temporary diarrhea or vomiting within 7 days after getting a dose of rotavirus vaccine than children who have not gotten the vaccine
4089987 the rate of pertussis peaked in the 1930s with 265 269 cases and 7518 deaths reported in the united states
4089988 a greater than 92 decline in cases and a 99 or greater decline in deaths due to diseases prevented by vaccines recommended before 1980 were shown for diphtheria mumps pertussis and tetanus endemic transmission of poliovirus and measles and rubella viruses has been eliminated in the united states smallpox has been eradicated worldwide declines were 80 or greater for cases and deaths of most vaccine preventable diseases targeted since 1980 including hepatitis a acute hepatitis b hib and varicella declines in cases and deaths of invasive s pneumoniae were 34 and 25 respectively
4089989 students who have scholarships in universities abroad are likewise trapped in gaza denied the opportunity to build a future
4089990 we probably wont be commenting on it until it goes forward
4089991 once we all sat down we all came to the conclusion that we couldnt reach an agreement pretty quick
4089992 they havent even asked for our suggestions all they have done is attack our workers
4089993 welcome to our meeting with history and modernity better diversity management through partnership
4089994 there is a growing body of knowledge out there that these devices are safe when used properly
4089995 we dont speak often enough about the number of lives that have been saved the number of people that are up and walking around today that might not have been had it not been for a taser
4089996 he has dvds that contain 130 studies that have found the devices to be safe
4089997 i think that when canadians look at the choices for use of force do they want to go back to batons and nightsticks or do they want to go to the future
