2700000 fue una carrera muy emotiva sab a que iba a ser muy dura en toda su extensi n
2700001 iba muy pareja en los 200 no estaba muy c modo con que estuvi ramos tan cerca tan entrada la carrera as que estir un poco m s mis brazadas en el pecho y en ese punto el libre ya es una bajada pura adrenalina
2700002 me sent a un poco cansado por la presi n espero mejorar poco a poco e ir avanzando hasta llegar a la medalla de oro
2700003 todos los boxeadores vienen a los juegos muy bien preparados por eso lo importante es pensar en hacer mi pelea sin obsesionarme con el rival
2700004 la tradici n del boxeo cubano que siempre ocupa la cima en los juegos ol mpicos
2700005 grecia tiene un buen equipo pero nosotros tuvimos una mejor presentaci n estoy contento por haber ganado ya que en un torneo como los ol mpicos siempre es importante arrancar ganando
2700006 estamos arriba jugamos un buen partido y eso fue lo m s relevante grecia tiene un gran equipo e hicieron un buen trabajo pero nosotros nos quedamos con el triunfo en esta oportunidad
2700007 ellos tiraron de 24 11 desde la l nea de tiros libres y eso inclin la balanza a nuestro favor es verdad que de haber logrado un mejor porcentaje no les daba los puntos que necesitaban pero sin duda alguna que hubiera cambiado el ritmo del juego considerablemente
2700008 creo que fue superior a mi rival que no hizo nada de boxeo se limit a agarrarme y no dejar que pele ramos
2700009 no perd el combate simplemente mi rival se dedic a agarrarme todo el tiempo

2700014 the regime in hanoi politically degenerate even by totalitarian standards refused to provide or even assist in providing a satisfactory accounting of american mias
2700015 while we all assume the very best about our servicemen who were held it captivity
2700016 there is a historical precedence of soviet chinese and north korean exploitation of american prisoners of war the success of the communist program in korea may well have been duplicated to a degree in vietnam
2700017 none of the returned u s prisoners of war released by vietnam were ever interrogated by the soviets
2700018 was that hug for bui tin a vietnamese official responsible for the torture of some american prisoners of war a message please dont give them my records
2700019 flying right over the heart of hanoi in a dive at about 4 500 feet when a russian missile the size of a telephone pole came up the sky was full of them and blew the right wing off my skyhawk dive bomber it went into an inverted almost straight down spin
2700020 i pulled the ejection handle and was knocked unconscious by the force of of the ejection the air speed was about 500 knots
2700021 o k ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital
2700022 there were hardly any amputees among the prisoners who came back because the north vietnamese just would not give medical treatment to someone who was badly injured they werent going to waste their time
2700023 mccain has failed to mention in public what he has confided to another u
2700024 a george patton who drove a corvette a randolph hearst who flew an f 16 a john wayne in aviator glasses and air force dress blues
2700025 when john mccain arrived in here in washington as a freshman republican congressman in 1983 one of the issues very much on his mind was how the united states should deal with vietnam he was he said dismayed by the reagan administrations flat refusal to afford any kind of diplomatic recognition to hanoi something he thought could help clear up a number of issues including the fate of those servicemen still missing in action mr mccain now the junior senator from arizona is leading a legislative effort to force the administration to open a lower level american post in vietnam which could be preliminary to more formal relations
2700026 the people who have done these things are not zealots in a good cause they are criminals and some of the most craven most cynical and most despicable human beings to ever run a scam
2700027 are the vietnamese now directing the affairs of the senate select committee

2700040 i would fail in my duty if i need not comment on the manner in which deposition has been made by witness appearing for the government senior home ministry officials
2700041 it is equally sorry state of affairs when a senior officer of the central government appears before the tribunal to submit that he is not aware with regard to matters which are put to him
2700042 it is certainly no excuse to say that you were not posted in the department responsible for the decision making appearing as a witness for the union government it becomes the duty and the responsibility of such officer to be fully aware of the matter with regard to which he is going to depose
2700043 it is shocking to know that for a minor re arrangement of some words for a few words at the end of the notification the notification of 2008 is almost a verbatim reproduction of the notification which was issued in 2006
2700044 with deep pain i would say that this is the most callous disregard of the statutory duty
2700045 even a single witness or a single case may be sufficient to support the claim of the government that an association is indulging in activities which is covered within the definition under the act
2700046 the requirement to furnish complete grounds is statutory and cannot be supplied by the background note such background note cannot be utilised to furnish the deficiencies in the notification which really has to satisfy the statutory prescription by itself
2700047 i make it clear that nothing herein contained is an expression of opinion on the merits of the reference with regard to the allegation made by the authority
2700048 beim schutz unserer kinder vor missbrauch oder gewalt kann und darf es keine kompromisse geben das bz hat sich hier immer daf r eingesetzt dass opferschutz vor t terschutz kommt

2700053 adolfs father alois hitler was the illegitimate son of maria anna schicklgruber it was generally supposed that the father of alois hitler schicklgruber was johann georg hiedler there are some people who seriously doubt that johann georg hiedler was the father of alois an austrian document was prepared that proved maria anna schicklgruber was living in vienna at the time she conceived at that time she was employed as a servant in the home of baron rothschild as soon as the family discovered her pregnancy she was sent back home where alois was born
2700054 caused such havoc as no file in the world ever caused before
2700055 the second bundle in the blue file contained the documents collected by dolfuss the small statured but big hearted austrian chancellor must have known by such a personal file he might be able to check hitler his task was not difficult as ruler of austria he could easily find out about the personal data and family of adolf hitler who had been born on austrian soil through the original birth certificates police registration cards protocols etc all contained in the original file the austrian chancellor succeeded in piecing together the disjointed parts of the puzzle creating a more or less logical entity a little servant girl hitlers grandmother came to vienna and became a domestic servant mostly working for rather rich families but she was unlucky having been seduced she was about to bear a child she went home to her village for her confinement where was the little maid serving in vienna this was not a very difficult problem very early vienna had instituted the system of compulsory police registration both servants and the employers were exposed to heavy fines if they neglected this duty chancellor dolfuss managed to discover the registration card the little innocent maid had been a servant at the rothschild mansion and hitlers unknown grandfather must be probably looked for in this magnificent house the dolfuss file stopped at this statement
2700056 it appears to me that hitler knew about his connection long before his chancellorship like his father before him when the going got rough the hitlers went to vienna hitlers father left his home village at an early age to seek his fortune in vienna when hitler was orphaned after his mother died in december of 1907 he left for vienna not long after the funeral there he seemed to drop out of sight for ten months what happened during this ten month stay in vienna is a complete mystery on which history sheds no light it makes sense now that it has become established that hitler was a rothschild that he and his cousins were getting acquainted and his potential for future family endeavours was being sized up
2700057 by the 1840s he had developed a somewhat reckless enthusiasm for young girls
2700058 he had a lecherous passion for very young girls his adventures with whom had to be hushed up by the police
2700059 religion mind control cult was funded by the rothschilds and he was a friend of theirs just like the founders of the mormons who were also rothschild funded through kuhn loeb and co

2700215 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said

2700228 in qingdao heeft de stroom veel effect op de baan we weten al redelijk precies hoe die zal zijn tijdens de spelen en met een overwegend zuidoostelijke wind in de richting van de stroming betekent dit dat het kruisrak procentueel langer duurt dan op een normale baan zonder stroom hoe lichter de condities worden hoe groter het procentuele verschil tussen kruis en spinnakerrak zal zijn

2700419 ti svegli e hai appena realizzato qualcosa ma non riesci a coglierne il significato
2700420 i spoke with kaka yesterday saturday we know that the clubs are talking about the transfer although they have not reached a conclusion yet
2700421 i think an august transfer is still a possibility though kaka will only talk about that when they do a deal
2700422 he is waiting for a deal and then he will start to negotiate with
2700423 iraqis are combating terrorism with one hand and building a democratic state with the other and this is not an easy job
2700424 we have carried messages to all the countries we visited that iraq is in need of reconstruction in all fields including railways oil electricity bridges and housing
2700425 we havent had any recent contact with real madrid has there been any attempt to heal the rift yeah that will be right
2700426 they put a bid in i dont know if it was fax or letter or whatever just one it was sometime in the summer
2700427 but the final decision was taken at the end of the season when the first nonsense appeared and cristiano referred to his future being decided in the next few days
2700428 it was decided there and then he was staying there was never any change in our stance
2700429 i think we will just let the thing settle down now it will take its course
2700430 i like competing and i wanted to stay in and finish the game but sometimes your emotions get the best of you and you might do something irrational out there he thought i did thats part of the game its all patched up now though were buddies
2700431 i missed a month without being here with the team
2700432 and i wanted to try to prove myself again that i can pitch in the big leagues and i wanted to stay out there as long as i could he made the decision and thats his decision
2700433 he just wanted to stay in the game and i like that theres nothing wrong with that in fact if he didnt want to stay in the game id probably be mad
2700434 ill tell you something his confidence got back thats why i took him out of the game i wasnt going to let him lose the game he was leaving on a high note and theres four left handed hitters standing there i wasnt going to give him a chance to get hit he already pitched a good game and did a good job
2700435 were all alone turn off the phone now that youre right off that patron let that freak out
2700436 show me your spot and shawty ill show you mine ill start at your heart and go deeper inside
2700437 im kissing on your stomach feeling on your booty i wanna have a party all over your body
2700438 our work ethic is definitely good we come to the ballpark with the idea that our guys like to play
2700439 when we dont score runs it means were not hitting with guys in scoring position
2700440 every day is a wanting to win deal putting 100 percent in everything about it theres no slack period or things like that but if you put forth the effort and you dont score runs i dont know i dont have the answer for that
2700441 we get to 3 2 and we chase a ball instead of taking ball four we dont execute or we have trouble executing i dont know what to do about it you can say well youve got to do something about it well what everything about it is attitude baseball is an attitude thing youve got to bring it every day
2700442 the reason is because i think ruiz throws better and he blocks balls better coste is very good defensively hes not a bad defensive catcher but i like ruiz on lidge better
2700443 getting them back was like making a big deal without losing anybody
2700444 in the past id have said a lot of guys would be gone but with them signing hanley to a long term deal it shows theyre willing to make an effort but i dont know who else theyd do that with nothing is for certain nobody knows who if anybody will be gone
2700445 right now weve put ourselves in a position to win the division and we cant worry about anything else
2700446 i got a strikeout on it a number of outs on it its probably not in the scouting report for them over there
2700447 so maybe what we see and what comes out is sometimes two different stories
2700448 im just going to move on ive already done that
2700449 he asked how short i said id get back to him
2700450 what happens when an honest undercover fbi agent infiltrates a biker gang and is forced to become a rogue agent because of an informant in the fbi
2700451 the state should promote vessel construction and companies should not wait in queues for such constructions
2700452 there are 40 private shipyards in turkey that build and maintain vessels
2700453 the ark europe company that we have established in the tuzla free zone will make it easier for us to provide service to our sub agencies owing to this action of ours which will relieve us from the obligation to purchase goods from inside turkey we will be able to purchase many goods from foreign countries and on much more appropriate conditions
2700454 during recent times we were tracking the companies making maritime shipment from russia the only problem of these companies was their inability to find mutual freights we have made some studies on this subject we are providing mutual freight to companies which make business with us owing to this support of ours we are providing their signing sign long term contracts with us
2700455 there are already foreign firms that are interested in our companies but unless we amass 5000 vessels and 20 year year long contracts we are not planning to take any partners
2700456 this situation also affects ship chandleries if the potential of the harbors is handled effectively this will also have reflections on the ship chandleries
2700457 tijdens lange en moeilijke regeringsondehandelingen in het jaar 2007 braken er relletjes uit in antwerpen deze vonken sprongen over naar andere delen in het land en al gauw stond heel het land in vuur en vlam
2700458 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2700459 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2700460 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2700461 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2700462 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2700463 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2700464 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2700465 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2700466 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2700467 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2700468 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2700469 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2700470 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2700471 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2700472 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2700473 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2700474 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2700475 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2700476 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2700477 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2700478 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2700479 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2700480 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2700481 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2700482 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2700483 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2700484 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2700485 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2700486 vendredi 8 ao t la dame surnom de lopposante ndlr a rencontr son avocat u kyi win de 13h00 15h00 propos de sa d tention
2700487 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2700488 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2700489 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2700490 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2700491 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2700492 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2700493 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2700494 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2700495 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2700496 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2700497 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2700498 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2700499 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2700500 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2700501 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2700502 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2700503 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2700504 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2700505 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

2700516 this bout is the best for me because its a fairly tough draw with the world championship bronze medallist kilicci a cuban carlos banteaux correa and i think the 2007 world championship silver medallist thailands manus boonjumnong too ive got a long road ahead
2700517 i think that was a very mature performance by the youngest member of our team hes not even 19 yet hes got a good brain and hes tremendously quick
2700518 the guy hit me with so many right hooks in the last three fights but he didnt touch me this time i could see it in his eyes after two rounds he was surprised that i was still there
2700519 i couldnt lose to him anymore four times would have been bad i figured out that when he kate has finished attacking he just stands there and thats when i can attack
2700520 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2700521 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2700522 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2700523 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2700524 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2700525 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2700526 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2700527 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2700528 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2700529 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2700530 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2700531 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2700532 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2700533 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2700534 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2700535 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2700536 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2700537 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2700538 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2700539 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2700540 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2700541 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2700542 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2700543 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2700544 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2700545 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care

2700548 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

2700553 lisola ne era infestata quando la colonia dei siciliani venne a popolarli
2700554 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2700555 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2700556 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2700557 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2700558 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2700559 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2700560 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2700561 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2700562 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2700563 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2700564 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2700565 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008 said daniel mudd fannie maes president and chief executive

2700572 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2700573 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2700574 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2700575 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2700576 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2700577 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2700578 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2700579 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2700580 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2700581 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2700582 obviously where interest rates are is a matter for the reserve bank and it acts independently and we dont speculate on what the reserve bank might do about interest rates acting prime minister julia gillard told abc television
2700583 but if interest rates were to fall then we expect banks to pass that on to mortgage holders
2700584 if you think your bank is giving you a bad deal then shop around and get a better deal she said
2700585 if the reserve bank of australia wants to reduce mortgage interest rates rather than simply prevent further increases in mortgage rates then it needs to act decisively and reduce the cash rate by 50 basis points in september macquarie bank senior economist brian redican said
2700586 of course it could be argued that if the rba did cut interest rates by 25 basis points in september but mortgage rates only fell modestly then the rba could always follow this up with another 25 basis point cut in october mr redican said
2700587 i think it is a little dramatic to say there wont be any non bank lenders mr bowen told channel 10
2700588 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2700589 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2700590 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2700591 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2700592 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2700593 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2700594 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2700595 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2700596 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2700597 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2700598 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base

2700601 ahluwalia may be one of the only composers of contemporary ghazals in canada and perhaps the western hemisphere because there is such a vast repertoire of this music today there are very few ghazal composers even in india
2700602 i think he could do some serious damage this spring
2700603 he is feeling well and came off the track last week pig rooting and squealing
2700604 the leg scanned up good but i decided to put him out to be safe
2700605 i think the suspensory was a bit soft last time and i didnt really like the look of it but i like the look of it now it is excellent
2700606 he is a really furnished gelding now who has not had much racing
2700607 i am thinking caulfield cup and possibly melbourne cup with him but he can just gradually progress
2700608 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2700609 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2700610 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2700611 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2700612 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2700613 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2700614 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2700615 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2700616 who are open to doing something on the production side
2700617 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2700618 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2700619 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2700620 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2700621 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2700622 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2700623 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2700624 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2700625 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2700626 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2700627 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2700628 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2700629 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2700630 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2700631 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2700632 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2700633 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2700634 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2700635 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2700636 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2700637 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2700638 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2700639 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2700640 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2700641 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2700642 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2700643 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2700644 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2700645 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2700646 you gas up the marker put on the gloves strap on the mask and walk onto the field

2700736 i wish kessler international was in there to tell you the truth i had a lot better feeling about their forensic promises than im getting from mark robinson and plante moran
2700737 it still galls me the way blair tried to explain to the judge that insane letter from dave peralta about why kessler didnt qualify as an independent auditor
2700738 burned in my mind audits arent fictional stories or news articles with slanted opinions numbers are numbers pure and simple an auditor is only going to find what is already there why isnt arbortext concerned that plante moran will find those same numbers

2700754 fine by me im pretty much speechless anyway what did blair say
2700755 he was speechless too he kind of slunk off the phone at the end jensen didnt leave him or bernheim any room to say anything as soon as blair finished his opening spiel jensen focused the rest of the call on me it was unbelievable
2700756 i guess blair has a shit faced phone call to make to dave peralta probably assured him he had everything under control
2700757 dick its dave peralta what the hells going on i thought we had a deal
2700758 what can i say the judge had an attack of sanity

2701135 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales

2701141 other booster clubs in kentucky and from other states have called because they have similar procedures
2701142 our organizations have had these fund raisers for years and theres never been a problem so the district is surprised at the irs position
2701143 the bryan station baseball booster association can no longer compensate band members for working bingo
2701144 therefore we can no longer participate in bingo as a dependable monthly fund raiser
2701145 so it looks like the keeper of the taxes irs has brought on the death of bingo
2701146 is a significant issue in the tax exempt organization arena
2701147 if a child cant afford it all they have to do is tell the director and its taken care of
2701148 the irs has not given any guidance to the booster clubs
2701149 we are just a bunch of parents trying to raise money because the school district doesnt fund a musical education for our children
2701150 and even though it was out of ignorance the right thing to do was to pay it
2701151 they were selling cookies candles flowers and fruit and then to penalize them it was causing major stress with the parents
2701152 actually it was very large the explosion we are two miles away here and we could feel it

2701165 bah aku tentulah aku mau pulang buat apa panas panas begini berlama lama di kampus
2701166 dan dan tahulah aku sekarang kenapa tak masuk kuliah kau tadi itu juga yang membuatmu marah marah padaku kan
2701167 eh apa apaan lo aku bicara soal statistik bukan masalah penyakit lupaku dasar bloon

2701171 there was a report that the insurgents were meeting in the village and foreign soldiers surrounded the area

2701177 right now we can see that paying all contributions in one fell swoop will be difficult
2701178 depending on the conditions on how the liquidation went and whether we can get a good price for our assets
2701179 the meetings are still on the broad strokes of the dissolution details like the return of the members contributions have yet to be discussed
2701180 there might be a need for a new law we must remember that the law that created the rsbs is still in effect so a new law might be needed to accommodate the small details
2701181 the financial crisis could be a good reason but if you have real estate assets with questionable or dubious titles how can you ever sell them you are still at the losing end
2701182 had infirmities these are nothing that cant be fixed and most of the problems have already been fixed
2701183 it would be more prudent to wait for better times so that we get a good price for the assets
2701184 we are still able to service our members at the same time we want to liquidate but not at a loss
2701185 for example there is a need to match the soldiers contribution from the governments end
2701186 we are working very systematically and very deliberately things cannot happen at the snap of a finger
2701187 there is a lot to be learned from our experience the prospects are really good for institutionalizing a new military pension system that is viable actuarially so as to extricate the government from the obligations of fully supporting the pension of the soldiers
2701188 i am optimistic that things will be better by then
2701189 being wives of those from class 95 the ruling class so to speak we felt responsible for them in a way a lot of families were so affected
2701190 we always say to each other eugene sonny and the others see you in better times i believe that its not always going to be like this things will change
2701191 i always believe in him and i support him i dont question his decisions
2701192 you really really have to understand his situation i just keep quiet when we have our misunderstandings i dont become confrontational i try to put myself in his shoes
2701193 that was the time that i was really able to have a dreamless sleep
2701194 they understand the situation and we encourage them to ask questions and to be honest and open to us as well
2701195 but the lord is my helper this second in my present outlook
2701196 microsoft moet zijn licentievoorwaarden veranderen om de distributie van windows op mogelijk te maken
2701197 microsoft moet een licentie bieden die software ontwikkelaars in staat stelt om windows te verspreiden als een zak vol bits
2701198 it may not be a perfect organization but we have made a lot of improvements in various fields administrative logistical and operational
2701199 there are scalawags or isolated cases of corruption but its not a massive malpractice that is sanctioned by the organization
2701200 are so ancient that they literally look like relics and they easily malfunction no new pistols have been issued since the 1960s
2701201 when it comes to the replacement of m 16s the philippine army is undergoing rebarreling for the period of 2003 up to date the army has already rebarreled a total of 22 280 m 16 rifles
2701202 the main problem of the air force is it has a huge funding requirement
2701203 the lack of such a policy resulted in the crafting of a highly ambitious and costly afp modernization law which is not even responsive to the actual needs of the afp in accomplishing the tasks given to it
2701204 there must be a life to the reform program because we cannot have a state of perpetual reform we will set our goals within the year as to where it should end and where the functions of the pdr should be undertaken by the major services themselves after the reform we go back already to normal operations inputting those reforms that should have a finite life there should be an end state
2701205 i want to come up with a policy paper so that the imperative need of strengthening the armed forces vis vis our regional position our international engagement not merely in terms right now of controlling the internal security situation but a step ahead after that
2701206 although it is very expensive to modernize it must be done
2701207 we cannot sacrifice forward planning envisioning for the armed forces perhaps in a paradigm when the philippines becomes a regional player a regional power we have to do that now if theres a windfall in the future if we have more resources we will not have the policy guidelines to use these resources efficiently we need to follow a well thought of well crafted map which should be flexible enough to address the dynamism of international realities
2701208 these results are bad news for gordon brown if labour are to have any hope of wooing the electorate then a change at the top may restore their fortunes but it is no magic bullet
2701209 and if labour chose a new leader he or she would have to work very hard to gain the publics confidence it would not come automatically
2701210 the government is serious in dealing with issues that will protect its continuous term in office up to 2010 whatever it does is within that framework it will reform the military if it helps to stave off problems
2701211 as an indicator that things were not really all right even after oakwood
2701212 if you really want to reform the afp and you keep on changing the leadership it gets problematic theres no sense of continuity this also allows corruption because sometimes these officers are just marking time and sometimes because its confusing up there nobody really pays attention down the line unless you do something that is glaring
2701213 the afp is a rigidly hierarchical organization which means that it can only be as good as its commander in chief
2701214 whatever measures being undertaken by the government to remove corruption in the afp might be undone in the months leading to the 2010 elections
2701215 the real test will come in 2010 whoever will be the cs chief of staff yano is okay for the time being from malaca angs perspective but after him whos it going to be thats going to be fun then
2701216 her below zero rating reflects peoples disgust over administrations incompetence misgovernance corruption extra judicial killings disappearances and a presidency without a mandate
2701217 the result is obviously due to the problems confronting the country brought about by the global food and energy crises the president is paying a high price for making the right decisions on very unpopular issues such as the evat
2701218 as a country we are all suffering from the world economic downturn factors beyond our control have seriously assaulted our economy and our way of life
2701219 we can only imagine how devastating the world fuel price crisis would have affected us
2701220 the sound economic and fiscal program of government has provided us with the necessary bouyancy that has so far kept us afloat in these rough seas
2701221 popularity is not what is important at this time much as it is desired it is not what this administration is after
2701222 buckle down to the nitty gritty of seeking ways to help cushion the effect of the world economic situation and just see to the immediate and effective implementation of programs to benefit our people
2701223 it maybe lonely at the top but the president is committed to see us through challenges
2701224 is very unfair for a very dedicated and hardworking president
2701225 now that were facing a crisis not to mention the rising number of unemployment in the country it should be expected that the presidents rating will further take a plunge
2701226 any president who wants to be popular can simply order that gas be retailed at p20 per liter rice at p10 a kilo the minimum wage to increase to p1 000 a day zero taxes on goods and no traffic fines
2701227 but these are not a prescription to popularity rather these will lead us to the road to perdition which brings us to the first lesson in presidency that most often the right decisions are tough and they will not endear you to the people
2701228 which though right are unpopular to the very same people who will benefit from them consumption taxes for example
2701229 so there are decisions she had made which although right are unpopular to the very same people who will benefit from them consumption taxes for example
2701230 pity her the two events beyond her control are being dumped on her lap
2701231 the first was an act of nature typhoon frank which walloped visayas but has whiplashed the president from undeserved criticisms despite her directives before during and after the storm to bring aid and comfort to those who are affected
2701232 theres a big improvement and were looking up in terms of capability development
2701233 change in the way our country is being run with that the day we see good governance being practiced by our national leaders will be the day the magdalo will lose its relevance in society
2701234 what we need is value formation and a system that would come after corrupt people in the afp and the government
2701235 theres a capacity for idealism embedded in each officers heart but there are so many ways of achieving change you can kick the sleeping dogs or you find a way around them but in the case of the magdalo they chose to kick the sleeping dogs its just a question of techniques
2701236 however the issues at oakwood pertained to that period of time right now we face different dynamic issues in terms of difficulties of global economies which directly affect our operations climate change which is really a big concern and finally the ever changing face of global terrorism
2701237 the capability upgrade is more practical and directly addresses the present requirements of the afp
2701238 what bothers me is that the mutineers are being double crossed ill have to speak out about what was agreed
2701239 inside a jail cell you are not witness to the state of the country with your own eyes the rising cost of living in unequal proportion with a failing economic order
2701240 but out of duty and desire i refuse not to see listen and feel
2701241 i believe i have done everything i can to deliver to the people the cold truth that gma for the past eight years in office has failed miserably to govern has caused and will continue to cause so much poverty death and destruction and has prostituted every government institution just to stay in power but while some people chose to talk and other people chose to whine i chose to act i am confident that the filipino people will survive their present ordeal
2701242 a decent nation is one where at minimum conditions are created in which its citizens can best pursue happiness
2701243 just what is happiness happiness is the assessment of the good and bad in our lives it is the emotional balance sheet we keep that allows us to say honestly if we are living a happy life in spite of the bad things that occur now and then
2701244 happiness is comprised of five factors namely faith work marriage charity and freedom
2701245 faith in general people who attend a place of worship almost every week or more are happier and more optimistic than those who rarely or never attend people who pray everyday are much happier than people who never prayed
2701246 work people who are satisfied with their jobs also say they are happy with their lives the bottom line here if we want to be happy we need to work and the fruits of our work are worth sharing with our kids as well
2701247 marriage married people are more likely to say that they are more happy than those who are single widowed or separated marriage isnt just associated with happiness it brings happiness to married couples
2701248 charity money does not buy happiness and that is certainly an accepted truth but evidence is clear that gifts to charitable organizations and other worthy causes bring substantial life satisfaction to the givers
2701249 freedom freedom and happiness are intimately related people who consider themselves free are a lot happier than those who have no freedom
2701250 the main reason is because filipinos are enduring the malfunctions of governance by greedy people at the helm surrounded by their corrupt conspirators whose only goal is to plunder the resources and wealth of the country
2701251 so let this be a reminder to all filipino electorates
2701252 from then on we must hold our leaders accountable for our welfare and happiness and refuse to take it lightly when politicians abridge the values of faith work family charity and freedom
2701253 over and above these considerations is the fact that he has not yet been convicted under our constitution he is entitled to presumption of innocence
2701254 i fully believe that sen trillanes would not try to escape and evade the court case against him before the court
2701255 the argument says that since there are 24 senators if one is eased out that is okay i disagree with that the collective judgement of 24 senators is diminished even if only one seat is made unnecessarily vacant
2701256 they have to get used to the weight of the rifle so that they will not drop the weapon when they toss the rifle and also while performing at the platform they actually have to execute the drills in sync with the rhythm of the music

2701266 we in up believe that by walking out of our classes we are ensuring the long term provision of all our basic needs today we take our classes to the streets
2701267 besides what is one day of walking out of class as compared to a year of hardship under crushing costs of basic needs like education and food
2701268 the iskolar ng bayan wants to show the entire nation that we are not just against the anti student policies on education but also the anti citizen policies of the arroyo administration that have been causing the nation to suffer
2701269 therefore it is the duty of students along with other sectors of society to demand the immediate revision of flawed government policies that caused these unabated increases in prices
2701270 filipinos at this time of difficulties usually close ranks and help collectively especially when we all know that this is triggered by global events like the meteoric rise of fuel prices that we cannot do much about except to mitigate until the economic storm blows over

2701273 issue timely intelligence assessments of political and security developments related to the oil price issue and alert government offices on the same it shall provide advice on matters affecting national security
2701274 why would they roll back when the price of oil in the world market continues to increase that has always been their reason for raising oil prices here its a sham because we know that next week they will again increase their price double
2701275 we do not want blood on our hands we do not want to use us taxpayers money to train their philippine military and police to kill their own people

2701460 having a wall definitely has a bad influence on business
2701461 the wall is not only for the beautification of the surroundings of the city for the olympics
2701462 the main concern is over the protection of the citys environment safety of the field work convenience and safety of passing pedestrians and other factors
2701463 there are individual shops that have not reached agreement to move resulting in delays
2701464 the wall will be replaced by greeneries plants or aesthetic fences
2701465 the government didnt have enough time to get everyone to move
2701466 so the wall went up for the olympics it is just to make a more beautiful environment for the city
2701467 were calling for an end to the chinese governments occupation in tibet
2701468 laura and i were also saddened by the attack on an american family and their chinese tour guide today in beijing
2701469 the united states government has offered to provide any assistance the family needs
2701470 as a team there is nothing more important to us than supporting mrs bachman in her struggle and supporting hugh and elisabeth in their grief we are absolutely devastated by what has occurred for their loss and for everything they are going through hugh has been in touch with the team throughout this tragedy and were extremely proud of the strength he and elisabeth are displaying they know were here for them in every way possible were banding together as a team to lift up the bachmans and mccutcheons we are a family and well get through this together as a family
2701471 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2701472 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2701473 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2701474 we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goose bumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2701475 appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics
2701476 no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2701477 its far too early to suggest that this has anything to do with the olympics
2701478 anxiety about poor spelling and grammar had been a constant theme
2701479 bene sappiate che quella punteggiatura un modo per attirare pi visite ed vietatatissima dagli aggregatori pidocchioso fino in fondo
2701480 ive watched kayaks flip over ive seen people just ram docks our dock almost got taken off the other week i thought the whole thing was just going to snap off
2701481 we rounded the corner of a dune and all of a sudden the beach that had been there yesterday it was gone
2701482 all there was instead was roaring white surf pouring into edgartown harbor
2701483 look at him you could water ski behind that sucker
2701484 its not the quiet peaceful little harbor that it once was
2701485 that and the possibility of sharks is kind of an eye opener at the beach
2701486 lets not irritate the physicians or else theyre going to take their patients to another hospital
2701487 the number one issue in the errors that occur is bad communication
2701488 the scissors didnt cut to his liking he was trying to cut suture material he said they were dull he tossed them across the room one of the nurses had to dodge the scissors
2701489 these incidents happen because the or environment is so high stress
2701490 surgeons hold patients lives in their hands yet theyre dependent on equipment and people who are outside their control this incident was over a year ago and there has not been another incident with this physician
2701491 you have an industry in crisis where people are having to do much more with limited resources that combination can be a potent one
2701492 he wasnt a doctrinaire conservative republican who didnt have compassion for groups of people who didnt have it made
2701493 there was a perception i had from the beginning that he did not relate to or get involved with us
2701494 im a lifetime member of the naacp here in phoenix and ive never seen him come around
2701495 im not particularly proud of my record with african americans mainly because im a senator from a state where the african american population is small
2701496 the episcopal high school class of 1954 was all male and all white
2701497 theres a standard mantra of race neutrality in the military a lot of people say when you wear the uniform its either green or light green not black and white
2701498 everybody told him dont do it because no one cares except the tribes and they are generally democrats and are probably going to be upset with whatever you do
2701499 after he heard that about 10 times he said im going to do it
2701500 he worked the navajo nation its a thing other statewide elected officials failed to do
2701501 on some poor reservations where the hollywood glamour drugs like cocaine do not exist some indian youth resort to using inhalants like gasoline sterno and even household items such as lysol spray
2701502 the town was only 5 000 people and maybe 700 votes but he would come by
2701503 he always struck me as a guy who would reach out
2701504 beginning in the 80s mccain began to see opportunities reaching out to the ministers of the gospel and say what can i do for you
2701505 said c t wright an arizona republican who once served as president of cheyney university of pennsylvania the countrys oldest historically black college
2701506 he helped bridge the gap that we republicans have with the black community and aided me in establishing an effective dialogue which transcends notions of party and race
2701507 at the time there werent a lot of big issues involving the african american community except to say that when the martin luther king issue came up i was on the wrong side of it
2701508 as we are embarking on a national policy of energy conservation i feel the costs are prohibitive
2701509 i dont think he appreciated fully how big of a positive impact it would make and he does now
2701510 when he became a senator he began to represent the state rather than the district and those contacts were few then i didnt see him that much in the community

2701515 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2701516 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2701517 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2701518 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2701519 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2701520 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2701521 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2701522 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2701523 we havent had to sleep on a park bench yet but finally with the help of a visitor to the building who could speak no english we found our apartment and the person waiting to settle us in
2701524 mi smo jedina reprezentacija ovdje od onih s punom kvotom dakle s ekipom i tri igra ice u pojedina nom dijelu u kojoj nema ni jedne kineskinje
2701525 na a elja je ulazak u etvrtfinale dakle osvajanje drugog mjesta u skupini s kinom austrijom koja je bila peta na pro lom svjetskom prvenstvu i dominikanskom republikom koja na poziciji broj 1 ima vrlo neugodnu kinskinju sposobnu dobiti ak i tamaru boro

2701528 the container broke and contents were released in the air
2701529 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of goodwill and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2701530 we have asked united states secretary of state condoleezza rice to mediate with the russians to transmit them our message
2701531 this is definitely necessary for preventing arms shipments to georgia by sea
2701532 a sea blockade of georgia will also help avert an escalation of military activity in abkhazia
2701533 strongly states its commitment to the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of georgia and its internationally recognised borders and urges russia to respect them
2701534 underscores that the military actions against georgia could affect eu russian relations
2701535 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops
2701536 what they are doing is nothing to do with conflict it is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2701537 the bicycles can either be auctioned off or donated to charity
2701538 there is no time limit as to when this auction may happen
2701539 when we are in the water it doesnt matter because the water doesnt really know how old you are when you hit the water
2701540 there are a lot of middle aged women and men who have contacted me or stopped me in the street and they have told me that i am an inspiration to them
2701541 they tell me they are doing things now they never thought they would do
2701542 i was in the ready room i didnt feel so good i got like these cold chills
2701543 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2701544 i was very nervous today as its been very difficult for my people
2701545 it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace
2701546 its probably going to be the most watched game in the history of the world
2701547 its going to send a lot of chills through my body just to be there and be part of it
2701548 issues with the structure and scope of the new government are likely to take centre stage
2701549 there has been a lot of comment regarding our position with regards to gareth barry
2701550 this is not about questioning the managers judgment or the ability of a particular player
2701551 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2701552 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2701553 i tend to not really get nervous when im out on a tennis court but today was a little different
2701554 this is even different than a davis cup davis cup is thrilling exciting definitely a little different but out here was crazy
2701555 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in florida
2701556 its pretty sticky youve got to keep your wristbands on and youve got to keep going to the towel
2701557 when i was changing sides there was plenty of sweat droplets on the court from chris as well

2701568 pope john paul ii has affirmed that the ecological crisis is a moral issue
2701569 god doesnt like a clearcut it makes his heart turn cold
2701570 resources equal to the combined wealth of the poorest 80 percent of the worlds population their leaders and principal shareholders are likely also to have the education and awareness to understand the environmental and humanitarian issues of global conservation
2701571 11 5 million acres an area the size of switzerland
2701572 an investment of about 28 billion is needed to maintain at least a representative sample of the earths ecosystems

2701577 how can machines ever be like us we are special
2701578 the amount of computational power in a personal computer will surpass that in a human brain sometime in the next twenty years
2701579 it is too early and the present too murky to see where all this leads
2701580 they are magnificent game fish and anglers dream about catching one to find one on a beach in britain is unheard of
2701581 debates about who was first for a particular technology rarely serve a useful role in understanding the historical development of technology

2701588 o senhor percebeu que fez um pai sem colo quando ele segurar uma crian a ela vai cair pelo v o das suas pernas
2701589 m es necessitam de colo o pai necessita de ombros fortes para equilibrar um menino na bicicleta ou segurar uma cabe a sonolenta no caminho de casa depois das brincadeiras do circo ou da ida ao parque

2701593 rielle is therefore making no statement now or in the future
2701594 furthermore rielle will not participate in dna testing or any other invasion of her or her daughters privacy now or in the future
2701595 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2701596 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2701597 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private
2701598 i am willing to take a paternity test to prove that the kid is not mine

2701605 it is regrettable that the formation of a single body with the sole remit of patient safety as we proposed is not
2701606 theres a major trust issue here i urge the minister to return with the intent to put her many words on patient safety into action and not remain an idle bystander as she often appears to be
2701607 some of the recommendations may involve additional expenditure but they must not become a victim of government cutbacks
2701608 i particularly welcome the recommendation for mandatory licensing of all public and private healthcare providers it seems bizarre that a licence is required to open a pub but not a hospital
2701609 financial management is important but no one expected that having been illegally charged by the state these elderly people would face a scheme where instead of receiving their rightful refunds they are being made offers to see what they might accept
2701610 the irish government has been consistently saying that they are very concerned about human rights in china and they believe that the best way to raise these matters is through private diplomacy doing it quietly with the chinese government
2701611 while we would absolutely agree that there is a space for private diplomacy the reality is that since china was awarded the games seven years ago promising to improve human rights in the country they simply havent delivered and in many cases human rights situations actually got worse so if thats quiet diplomacy it simply isnt working

2701624 we had made a number of discoveries here years ago but in 2002 i had decided to stop all work we had found 234 mummies which is quite enough the valley of the golden mummies is huge and encompasses around 10 000 mummies it is egypts biggest burial area and was used by egyptians from all classes i believe mummies should remain underground but then i decided to start work again
2701625 we had x ray machines through which we discovered that three of the mummies we studied had died of chronic headache many of the people had injuries on their arms and legs a seven year old boy we found was wearing a golden cobra on his forehead to protect him in the next life the people here had died at a young age and the reason was probably the water which we found to be too rich in iron
2701626 this area was one of the richest in the country they made the greatest date wine which was exported to rome and france it is also the hugest burial area discovered so far which means that it can give us complete information about the lifestyle of the time
2701627 that was a real joke how can a scientist hold an axe and just hack at a tomb on air all scientists know that a lot of processes should precede the opening of a tomb if you just hack away at it you lose important historical evidence i am sad that this is what egyptology has come to
2701628 and this is the hotel that people book last people forget im here because im on the west side of town even that being my case the revenues are up
2701629 generally speaking in colorado the markets are relatively flat to declining slightly particularly in april may and june
2701630 its the economy slowing down oil and gas prices going up and a feeling of economic uncertainty among people
2701631 it does seem like its down over the whole state but it does not shock me that greeley is growing that much
2701632 its just been the trend weve seen since weve been opened i think theres a lot more business there than any of us really anticipated
2701633 people are so loyal to the hilton brand and the hampton inn is the first hilton product into the greeley market
2701634 maybe people who would have normally stayed in loveland because of a hilton product there perhaps theyve come to stay in greeley its due in part to the hilton central reservation system
2701635 as ive talked with lodgers month by month theyve noticed an increase in their business activity
2701636 without a knife blade bottle opener or even a husband
2701637 so when you ask me what i have done with my dress allowance and the housekeeping money i shall know exactly dont you think im a clever girl
2701638 but it is clear that women live in slightly worse circumstances and probably as a result are less healthy and less mentally happy than males
2701639 however they are quieter more honest but less certain than males on some issues while they are less involved in the formal workplace more women are looking for work than men they are also less involved in the formal banking sector but they do have more store cards or retail accounts they do most of the shopping
2701640 there is no need for us to carry out an inspection now
2701641 we received word from the hemraj family spokesman pastor paul saul that there would be no need for an inspection as the creche would not be operating again
2701642 the onus is on the parent to ensure that the daycare centre or creche is registered with the municipality the creches can only be registered with us if they comply with our stringent health and safety requirements once registered our officers conduct regular inspections to ensure that the creches are complying with our health and safety standards
2701643 best temporary measure to extricate the country from its worst situation
2701644 georgia is a sovereign nation and its territorial integrity must be respected
2701645 i for the life of me cant imagine how that could be a proportional response to allegations that georgians had fired upon russian peacekeepers
2701646 the reason were going to the region in such a rush is that were trying to figure out whats going on down there
2701647 if you compare the russian side with the georgian side it appears right away that something is really very wrong with the information we are receiving
2701648 those who have been supplying arms to georgia i believe they should feel part of the blame for the loss of life of civilians including many russian citizens and peacekeepers
2701649 i think those who have been appeasing mr saakashvilis aggressive intentions and who helped create a feeling of impunity among the georgian leadership should think twice
2701650 its great news that a review of vaccine already in the supply chain has resulted in the decision to enlarge the zone
2701651 its now crucial that all farmers get in touch with their vets if they have not already done so to register their vaccine requirements
2701652 do you know that hamas was the first to use the weapon of suicide bombers against civilian targets
2701653 everybody calls me a zionist even though im in favour of non ethnically based states
2701654 opposition to the state of israel as a jewish state and to the zionist movement
2701655 the zionist structure of the state of israel is at the heart of the racism and oppression against the palestinian people and should be dismantled
2701656 the reference to the occupation and colonisation of all arab lands is a barely disguised demand for the disestablishment of the state of israel as is the requirement that palestinian refugees return to their homes and properties

2701819 i was right there and had most of the area raked out when i heard rustling
2701820 so what do i do i scream which i know youre not supposed to do i grabbed the kids and ran inside
2701821 wed been to storyland the day before and she saw all the animals so i think she was a little bit unfazed by the animal watching by the time we saw the bear
2701822 i think if i didnt have the kids i would have been like oh what a cute bear
2701823 but my hands were shaking so badly once we got inside

2701829 all candidates say theyre going to tell the truth and then dont but mccain has made truth telling the central theme of his campaigns
2701830 his bus is called the straight talk express and he promises candor at nearly every event and yet his ads arent truthful theyre not necessarily mean just untrue mccain has also pledged to run a clean campaign and suggesting obama was too media crazed to make time to visit wounded troops on his recent overseas trip even though he visited wounded soldiers in iraq wasnt clean
2701831 barack obamas tire pressure proposal would be comical if it werent so tragic obama either doesnt understand the seriousness of americas energy crisis or he lacks the experience to know how to solve the problem
2701832 either way his focus on tire pressure provides a stark contrast to john mccains comprehensive all of the above plan to reduce fuel costs and lead america to energy independence
2701833 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant

2701839 i went through that once and im not going to do it again if anybody says im a racist im not going to stand for that
2701840 i would rather lose a war to win a political campaign that is patently offensive when his campaign ran an ad suggesting that i had refused to visit wounded troops because i couldnt have tv cameras with me reporters immediately said that was patently false im not going to sit back and let my record be distorted
2701841 offer each party a chance to showcase its best ideas
2701842 will allow people to see sen mccain and myself interact in a way that keeps people more honest because youre standing there face to face
2701843 when you have to stand on a stage with your opponent as ive done in other campaigns you obviously have a tendency to improve the relationship when you have to spend time with somebody i think it changes the equation
2701844 i think the notion that somehow as a consequence of not having joint appearances sen mccain felt obliged to suggest that id rather lose a war to win a campaign doesnt automatically follow i think we each have control over ourselves and our campaigns and we have to take responsibility for that
2701845 we responded with an offer of doing five debates rather than the traditional three which the mccain campaign declined
2701846 is that both the conventions and the debates will offer formats for sen mccain and myself to make our best case to the american people at a time when the american people will be paying attention
2701847 and ultimately the best corrective to overly negative campaigns are the american people who are not interested in a lot of bickering but are interested in whos got the best answers for the country
2701848 despite prior skepticism over effectiveness china claims successful application of weather intervention to ensure a stunning olympic opening ceremony according to
2701849 if you watch the olympics gymnastics this year you may be confused by the new scoring system which will let athletes score 14 17 or even higher the new rules are heavy on math and employ two panels of judges one for technical difficulty which adds points up from a score of zero the other for execution and technique which starts at 10 0 and subtracts for errors the two numbers are then combined for the final score as one judge put it the system rewards difficulty but the mistakes are also more costly the new rules were adopted after south korea protested a scoring at the 2004 olympics

2701899 it gave a tiny bit of disturbance in the last moment to reorganize
2701900 it made me a little more nervous because i did know that we had only four girls competing now and our team was slowly dwindling down

2701928 no one may be disturbed on account of his opinions even religious ones as long as the manifestation of such opinions does not interfere with the established law and order
2701929 in late june the conseil detat frances highest administrative court essentially decided that wearing a
2701930 lead ing a life almost of a recluse cut off from french society leaving the house only to walk with her children or visit relatives
2701931 incompatible with the essential values of the french community notably with the principle of equality of the sexes
2701932 since the civil code requirements for gaining french citizenship have been revised over the last 15 years to require more and more complete assimilation the conseil felt justified in denying ms
2701933 not a religious sign but the visible sign of a totalitarian political project preaching inequality between the sexes which carries within it the total absence of democracy

2701936 i see life as being a movement in you that has a certain certainty but you cant hang on its like a healthy earth youve got to put air in it youve got to ask questions and move it in order not to become stuck in your thinking
2701937 in film we have to get intimate very quickly youre showing your soul you have to get naked sometimes physically but mostly emotionally dancers dont really get involved emotionally that much because it would be too much theyre so close physically all the time the body becomes like a tool
2701938 to put emotion and body together its a weird experience because its a very intimate relationship
2701939 he gave me so much freedom that i needed to be even more creative because there was no set up no lines it was just an improvisation on the moment when you start you think its the directors who are the ones making the decisions but for hou hsiao hsien it doesnt happen like this its shaped by those hes working with or by the sky the cars the birds coming into shot suddenly you see creation in a different way with michael haneke id say its the opposite its intense energy determined by a decision he made on his own in his little house in austria
2701940 painful in the sense that it was too rigid for me i was already an independent atom
2701941 the collaboration is so close with some directors that i feel like even though im not in the editing room im in the middle of it im proposing things
2701942 i wrote the poems because i wanted to write letters to the directors i wanted to leave a trace of what had happened
2701943 searching in the battle of being we attempted to glimpse the other side dance took us in its arms bliss of green nature in the land of oil and vine
2701944 i think in acting its that also what can be said is between the words
2701945 i embrace it because its a sign of outside recognition its not about you personally but allowing it to come through you is a very touching thing it gives you a sort of humility if you take it personally its another story then you need more and more and more and its never enough
2701946 i stopped being the nice little obedient girl when i started as an actress i wanted to please so much i think we all need to be loved when we fail were very very hurt and behave in such a way that nobody is going to love us theres a moment when youre jumping into the trust and you dont know if youll be loved or not youve got to dare to allow for not being loved if you dont dare that youre not an artist
2701947 i dont speak about my private life im very intimate in my way of working and i reveal a lot in me in films so i dont need to reveal my private life because im giving enough i give so much on screen i cant give everything to the public im very good at being the keeper of my privacy
2701948 we help people heal themselves think about themselves get their emotions back into them
2701949 its the connection between your body and your heart youve got to make a connection some people are disconnected or else between their head and their body theres not a heart by subliming life into film we actors condense all the questions that a human being can go through

2701972 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2701973 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2701974 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2701975 the state of massachusetts has asked a federal judge for a temporary restraining order preventing three mit students from giving a presentation on sunday about hacking smartcards used in the boston subway system
2701976 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2701977 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2701978 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2701979 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2701980 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2701981 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
2701982 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
2701983 this is why most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
2701984 the cbi along with most other forecasters has been consistently over optimistic about the economic outlook over the last 12 months
2701985 ive been meaning to write about my new bike a fixed gear for months now im in paris and im enjoying the parisians more relaxed attitude to cycling and wondering why london cycling is so frantic
2701986 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
2701987 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
2701988 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
2701989 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
2701990 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
2701991 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
2701992 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
2701993 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
2701994 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
2701995 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
2701996 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
2701997 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
2701998 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce
2701999 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one

2702019 the spate of fuel fires in hungary were all extinguished quickly and no one was hurt but they did serve to remind us how potentially volatile pit stops are
2702020 from my point of view a bigger drawback of refuelling is that it detracts from the racing by turning the grand prix into a series of low fuel sprints between pit stops
2702021 in the days pre 1994 when you carried your entire race fuel load on board the car there was a much bigger role for the driver in managing the tyres and brakes
2702022 these days in dry conditions you very rarely see anyone win from further back than the second row of the grid because race pace largely mirrors qualifying pace which is not surprising when the conditions are so similar
2702023 so if we need to spice up the racing in my view one of the best ways of doing that would be to ban refuelling
2702024 the lawbreakers drove a taxi to the local public security office industry and business administration and other sites and tossed home made explosives destroying two police vehicles

2702214 recently what i heard is that girija prasad koirala is being made the pm again beware it will be intolerable for nepali people if any bid is made to continue the status quo against the aspirations of nepali people for change through conspiracy of national and international reactionary forces and robbers

2702229 there were several explosions in several places in the county seat of kuqa this morning and we heard them from the hospital
2702230 obviously to hear his voice and get leadership from him meant a tremendous amount to myself and the guys
2702231 hes been the guy who has steered our squad through these last four years as we built up our team he talked about trying to move on to volleyball
2702232 hugh has dedicated so much time and energy and his passion has been good for us he just told us it will be difficult but together were going to be much stronger to hear from him was a tremendous relief on us
2702233 he knows that we need him im sure his interests are conflicted but hell be back when hes ready

2702235 we can have ideological differences among us tibetans but we must stand united in our struggle for freedom from chinese rule
2702236 the olympics games have started in beijing and may go on successfully but we must not stop struggling for our freedom and for the freedom of tibetans suffering inside tibet
2702237 we must not let the selfless and supreme sacrifices made by our own tibetan brothers and sisters in staging recent demonstrations across tibet go in vain
2702238 we must force china to stop the ongoing crisis and brutal repression in tibet

2702240 expressei a grande preocupa o da comunidade internacional em rela o mudan a do governo e perguntei sobre as inten es das autoridades para a volta da ordem constitucional

2702242 eu sou extremamente agressivo mas hoje eu estava um pouco acuado n o sei porqu eu podia ter imposto um pouco mais o meu estilo de luta
2702243 eu esperava que o coreano fosse o mais dif cil tanto que foi uma luta bem dura mas tem dias em que nada funciona acho que hoje n o era o meu dia tenho que pedir desculpas para as pessoas que acreditaram
2702244 muito subjetivo tem vez que o golpe vale ponto tem vez que n o vale pena que n o marcaram mas n o posso culpar a arbitragem pela derrota
2702245 the trial is over but im stuck here in the massive heave of humanity trying to get the free bag of goodies
2702246 i wanted to say something harsh but i dont want to take the risk
2702247 the knower of the unseen reveals not his secrets to anyone
2702248 i feel acceptance among the team and the coach and would be a bad captain if the captains armband was to change me as a person
2702249 now i have got to be even more of a role model and keep control of myself better
2702250 the coach will expect me to speak my mind with him i have no fear arguing with jurgen klinsmann and do not shy from conflict
2702251 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2702252 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2702253 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2702254 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2702255 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2702256 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2702257 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2702258 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2702259 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best

2702265 despite good fundamentals we have been unable to insulate ourselves from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year the latter part of the year also seems difficult and the operational result for the second half of the year might dip into the red
2702266 high fuel prices and a trend towards lower ticket prices have been unsettling developments for airlines the overcapacity in the market has not allowed ticket prices to rise in parallel with costs the coming cost cutting programmes in the sector will be so severe that in countries where airlines collapse there may be demands for flight connections to be maintained for business needs using state funds
2702267 the situation in the sector may remain extremely difficult due to expensive fuel and uncertain development of demand in the second half of the year fuel costs are expected to account for around 28 per cent of finnairs turnover whereas last year the jet fuel bill accounted for a fifth of turnover
2702268 in punctuality we are again among the best of european airlines moreover the amount of baggage delays has also fallen to a third of last summers total

2702278 when i came in the city had a lot of work to be done
2702279 weve had some operators that needed absolutely no guidance took their business very seriously and went after education opportunities
2702280 weve had others who needed a lot of assistance and education and unfortunately a few places have had to close for repairs
2702281 sometimes getting into these old buildings and trying to find out whats going on takes a monumental effort
2702282 what we are finding with some of the older facilities is we have to spend an inordinate amount of time to get them up to code and running
2702283 i dont think her objective is to get anyone into the news its about protecting the public and the business owner so they dont find themselves in a civil suit because someone got ill
2702284 i think anybody doing a good job in the industry appreciates her
2702285 were not in the business to make people sick and were not in the business to operate out of code
2702286 fifty years ago many women who married did so as teenagers
2702287 in a relatively short period of time that has completely changed the really young married teens have almost vanished

2702289 i felt love in my heart like we were supposed to be together
2702290 they didnt even get a chance to know each other

2702294 i would fail in my duty if i need not comment on the manner in which deposition has been made by witness appearing for the government senior home ministry officials
2702295 it is equally sorry state of affairs when a senior officer of the central government appears before the tribunal to submit that he is not aware with regard to matters which are put to him
2702296 it is certainly no excuse to say that you were not posted in the department or were not designate responsible for the decision making appearing as a witness for the union government it becomes the duty and the responsibility of such officer to be fully aware of the matter with regard to which he is going to depose
2702297 it is shocking to know that for a minor re arrangement of some words for a few words at the end of the notification the notification of 2008 is almost a verbatim reproduction of the notification which was issued in 2006
2702298 with deep pain i would say that this is the most callous disregard of the statutory duty
2702299 even a single witness or a single case may be sufficient to support the claim of the government that an association is indulging in activities which is covered within the definition under the act
2702300 i think cheryl is great shes very knowledgeable about music and i think shes going to bring a new side to the show

2702302 i had such a hard time being the new girl last year and i didnt want her to suffer the same
2702303 sharon and i just didnt click she made constant comments about me saying i was just there because of my looks it was upsetting because ive watched and loved all her stuff and always picked her out as a real womans woman but i didnt have that experience with her

2702340 its a great song and video and i was chuffed to play the lead female role especially as i get to act in some dramatic scenes

2702346 the chemistry between us is so strong you can feel it i love dressing up for him
2702347 hes also mad about towering high heels worn with very short skirts the miniest of mini and maybe a tiny little vest top

2702358 at one stage one of our players was standing 20m away from him and i asked why you would actually allow andrew mcleod to stand on a halfback flank by himself at that particular point
2702359 thats what happens when you start worrying about what the scoreboard says rather than just playing sometimes that switches the brain off which is not great in any standard of footy
2702360 we wanted to get the ball in as quick as we possibly could their ability to hold their structure defensively was very good early
2702361 our inability to engage their defenders was very poor and the times we did get it in we were outnumbered
2702362 we still clearly at the moment havent been able to get our game structure going and our style going against the better sides in the competition and probably the sides whove played a bit of finals footy
2702363 what you need to be able to do is either stand up and have your structure stand up or be able to fight out a really dour one on one struggle when conditions were like today
2702364 i dont like where gundam and macross are going nowadays
2702365 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2702366 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2702367 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in florida
2702368 its going to be a grind by the end of the week whoever is left standing is going to have to be someone thats in great shape physically
2702369 these are really tough conditions we play somewhere different every week but this time its really hot really humid and the balls are really slow
2702370 perch si completano a vicenda perch nulla scontato perch lei si persa nei sui occhi di ghiaccio perch basta non fermarsi alle apparenze per trovare quello che hai sempre cercato
2702371 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2702372 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2702373 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2702374 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2702375 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2702376 we were ready to leave the olympic games and we were waiting until very late for this decision
2702377 she told us we should stay in the best interest of the country
2702378 we really felt the loss as one of our own
2702379 maybe thats why it hurts so much it hit so close
2702380 in volleyball if you let up the other team takes advantage
2702381 weve always been talking about team and that goes for the coaches too
2702382 the best we can honor them is to go out and play hard
2702383 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2702384 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale in these conditions our forces conducted redeployment
2702385 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2702386 if the disproportionate and dangerous escalation on the russian side continues that this will have a significant long term impact on u s russian relations
2702387 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this

2702390 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008 said daniel mudd fannie maes president and chief executive
2702391 to help us manage through the most difficult us housing market in more than 70 years
2702392 raise the spectre that we are not out of the woods yet despite some better than expected earnings results although still down significantly from last year in the second quarter he said
2702393 were working on setting up a really annoying system for them to filter
2702394 some of the isps decided to nullroute so we changed ip so it works for them now some other decided to block the domain name so we added
2702395 were quite used to fascist countries not allowing freedom of speech a lot of smaller nations that have dictators decide to block our site since we can help spread information that could be harmful to the dictators
2702396 its quite funny that the country italy is run by the biggest media mogul of them all were his competitors

2702405 it wasnt taxes it was spending we presided over the largest increase in the size of government since the great society and we mortgaged our childrens futures to the great disgrace of the republican party we let earmarking and corrupt spending get to the point where we mortgaged our kids futures
2702406 a nice place but pricey for basic food like burgers and sandwiches does the d cor warrant the extra cost maybe if you have just finished a hard days haggling in ya xiu but why go past a dozen similar places just to eat there

2702411 all of this would be completely unnecessary if the legislature had just done its job
2702412 its far more important to deal with knowns rather than unknowns
2702413 only if floridians want to pay an average of 200 more in taxes should they vote for this
2702414 the only question is how much that standard should be we absolutely need to encourage renewables
2702415 focuses on the wrong thing on process how utilities generate power rather than on performance how much pollution they emit which is what ultimately counts
2702416 in essence renewable standards subsidies and other mandates assume that the government has all the answers rather than letting the market figure out the best way to produce energy at the lowest possible cost
2702417 doesnt have a lot of favor in the economic profession
2702418 creating competition between renewable energy developers by achieving economies of scale in manufacturing and through technological innovation
2702419 the reality is that not all states are fortunate enough to have abundant traditional renewable energy resources such as wind this is especially true in the southeast
2702420 will be required to purchase higher cost renewable energy from other suppliers
2702421 southeastern states have enough potential bioenergy incremental hydro solar wind and landfill gas resources to meet at least 50 percent of their current electric power needs
2702422 we are in full support of the governors climate change initiatives including the creation of a renewable portfolio standard we wholeheartedly believe the right rps policies will lead to significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions as a clean energy company we want an rps that is in the best interest of our customers a florida rps should work toward securing our customers energy future to meet carbon reduction goals non emitting energy sources such as wind solar and nuclear should count toward satisfying any targets new renewable technologies can mean higher cost to the consumer these new policies should be introduced in the marketplace in a manner that maintains reliable electric service and reasonable electric prices
2702423 of course in the places that are predominantly white such as the mountains you see notable jumps in median age
2702424 a lot of it is based on white america versus where the immigrant population is
2702425 you have a long term out migration of young talent
2702426 it is not just solely immigrant geography it is also a brain drain of young talent when you put that in you have a double edged sword there is no young immigrant population coming in and the existing young talent is leaving
2702427 it seems the young people are leaving the rural areas and we are a very rural county
2702428 in the long haul it is going to be a significant problem for those counties that have a high senior population
2702429 with a system of education that puts up the elite good education was never designed for the masses
2702430 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games the olympic games
2702431 patriotism is easy to understand in america it means looking out for yourself by looking out for your country
2702432 students dont look at learning the way i looked at learning
2702433 were in the middle of an upheaval in education students scarcely need to pay attention anymore because everythings always at their fingertips
2702434 with increased access to the internet my studying time has actually gone down
2702435 i have more information so i dont need an entire book i can just cut to the chase and get the meaty facts i need online
2702436 i hardly ever go to the library now because you can get anything you want online
2702437 it was not too long ago that the idea of having something small in your hand that you could talk into was considered nerdy and star treky
2702438 i can actually remember when your computer had approximately 32 kb of space to use
2702439 even making your classroom as futuristic as possible with new technology you still need to use the basics of good teaching
2702440 the hardest part for educators right now is to integrate the internet into part of their curriculum because it is a resource thats already so well used by students
2702441 its leading us as teachers to build problem solving strategies because we dont need our brains to hold information anymore we have computers to do that
2702442 what we need to be teaching kids now is how to apply that information
2702443 its calling upon schools to jump into the 21st century so to speak and provide access to the internet
2702444 i could read a book faster than i could log onto google at school
2702445 its so slow and run down that we need money to support new technology
2702446 im relegated to using technology thats been around since i dont know 1960 an overhead projector
2702447 education is going through a crisis theres a disconnect between the agenda of the students and the agenda of the school if you cant convince people that what youre selling is worth their time and interest then somethings wrong
2702448 by working with access to integrate omap platform based hardware and software we can deliver no compromise web browsing and an enhanced user experience
2702449 following some recent heavy rain i noticed a lot of tiny

2702487 anytime you think you can get close to michael phelps he jumps another level
2702488 that was the difference in the race which its kind of gratifying to see that happen after many years of trying to make it happen he paced it really well he didnt use too much energy on the butterfly he did the backstroke at the right effort level and then when he knew he was going to have to really put it into the breaststroke he did
2702489 it hit me today that that was his best race
2702490 i said to bob i wanted to sing on the medal podium but i just couldnt stop crying
2702491 everything that happened this year the ups and downs weve had this year and ryan is coming on like a freight train i was just happy to get the first one under my belt thinking about all that just made me start getting more and more emotional

2702498 we are not operating in any way which may counter israeli interests we have turned down many requests involving arms sales to georgia and the ones which have been approves have been duly scrutinized so far we have placed no limitations on the sale of protective measures
2702499 they contacted defense industry officials and arms dealers and told them that georgia had relatively large budgets and could be interested in purchasing israeli weapons
2702500 his door was always open to the israelis who came and offered his country arms systems made in israel
2702501 compared to countries in eastern europe the deals in this country were conducted fast mainly due to the defense ministers personal involvement
2702502 it was clear that too many unmistakable israeli systems in the possesion of the georgian army would be like a red cloth in the face of a raging bull as far as russia is concerned
2702503 and that the interception of three of these rpvs in the past three months was an expression of this anger not everyone in israel understood the sensitive nerve israel touched when it supplied such an advanced arms system to a country whose relations with russia are highly tense
2702504 we conducted a small job for them several years ago
2702505 the israeli is the main investor in the georgian economy everyone is there directly or indirectly
2702506 the israelis should be proud of themselves for the israeli training and education received by the georgian soldiers
2702507 we are now in a fight against the great russia
2702508 and our hope is to receive assistance from the white house because georgia cannot survive on its own
2702509 its important that the entire world understands that what is happening in georgia now will affect the entire world order its not just georgias business but the entire worlds business

2702530 we are sorry for the delay but we have dr martin luther king on the plane and to be sure that all of the bags were checked and to be sure that nothing would be wrong with the plane we had to check out everything carefully and weve had the plane protected and guarded all night

2702552 weve had some operators that needed absolutely no guidance took their business very seriously and went after education opportunities
2702553 weve had others who needed a lot of assistance and education and unfortunately a few places have had to close for repairs
2702554 sometimes getting into these old buildings and trying to find out whats going on takes a monumental effort

2702564 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale
2702565 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2702566 all those actions and signals we have seen are not things which would not be conducive to a ceasefire
2702567 and then they must accept the need to sign an agreement on non use of force with south ossetians
2702568 upon receiving the recommendations of the iocs disciplinary commission the executive board has declared miss thanou ineligible to participate in the 2008 beijing olympic games
2702569 to send a firm signal of the iocs moral consideration that this case has brought the olympic movement very much into disrepute
2702570 this is an ioc ruling based on its olympic charter
2702571 there was a whole string of events that took place in this sorry tale they really resulted in what the ioc sees as a scandalous saga
2702572 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2702573 and we are willing to disengage disengage immediately and as soon as they stop to shoot at us were willing to take any steps first steps required for us
2702574 the reality is that the small nation of georgia is being brutally attacked by big neighbour russia mr saakashvili said as the conflict over control of south ossetia widened well beyond the breakaway region
2702575 russian tanks unprovoked came into georgia into a small nation in the middle of the country
2702576 theyre fighting war and theyre bombing us all around the country theyre bombing us from the west from the east and from the north and from the south they are bombing civilian targets he said
2702577 and the point is this should stop immediately the world should unify time for the world to deal unequivocally to deal with this violence speak with one voice to condemn these war crimes
2702578 show restraint and to refrain from any further acts of violence or force
2702579 it was definitely the hottest and longest ceremony i have been in
2702580 it was really all too long for the athletes even i got dehydrated
2702581 at most olympics they have a big live screen where the athletes can watch what is happening inside here they missed out on that
2702582 being elaborate delayed the whole process this was not a comfortable ceremony for the athletes who should after all be the primary focus of the organisers
2702583 the technology support system of the opening ceremony was a challenge as big as a spacecraft launch

2702611 i felt love in my heart like we were supposed to be together
2702612 they didnt even get a chance to know each other

2702624 i think anybody doing a good job in the industry appreciates her
2702625 were not in the business to make people sick and were not in the business to operate out of code
2702626 the baby was in her removable car seat sleeping on the patio and kirra was playing
2702627 i was right there and had most of the area raked out when i heard rustling
2702628 so what do i do i scream which i know youre not supposed to do i grabbed the kids and ran inside
2702629 wed been to storyland the day before and she saw all the animals so i think she was a little bit unfazed by the animal watching by the time we saw the bear
2702630 i think if i didnt have the kids i would have been like oh what a cute bear
2702631 but my hands were shaking so badly once we got inside
2702632 black bears are very opportunistic eaters most of their diet consists of grasses roots berries and insects they will also eat fish and mammals including carrion and easily develop a taste for human foods and garbage
2702633 i heard something brush against the house outside and i thought ok thats bigger than a mouse

2702636 this is a perfect place for families to come and were all about family events
2702637 we cover it with sand to keep all air out and it sits there and cooks for 20 hours
2702638 the reason we come is to reinforce the local aspect and let the consumer understand when they buy cabot cheese theyre helping preserve the rural landscape

2702642 that single investment in the resources of the committed veterans of the united states of america has had a huge impact
2702643 its sometimes fashionable to say the government cant do anything right but i think our government along with help from the american legion got that one right
2702644 we all owe all veterans a great debt of service and gratitude
2702645 we should all be giving to you yet the american legion gives so much to our community and to our country
2702646 thats the kind of country we are that youll find pretty much across the spectrum people who stepped up and served

2702653 its a beautiful town on a beautiful day and the crowds were great
2702654 it was great day it was nice to run in the sun and not the rain
2702655 i definitely had to push because iworsky is good and you knew you had pressure behind you
2702656 i took it out hard because i saw a bunch of high school kids cross country kids
2702657 so i thought theyd take it out hard but they must have been on break or something because i found myself alone behind the police cruiser
2702658 the first part of the race went great i was right where i wanted to be at 5 52 for the first mile and then i just started slowing down i dont know what happened
2702659 it could be because im training for a triathlon next weekend and ive been spending more time on the bike and less time on the road and my legs felt it mastin was getting closer and if it wouldve been another mile he probably wouldve taken me
2702660 it wasnt my fastest time but it was a good time and ill take it
2702661 at the third mile i figured if i can still run go for it and i never looked back
2702662 i dont get too competitive in that respect i just try to run and hold on and do the best i can do
2702663 its a good course with some flat spots that lets you push a little bit
2702664 i think the audience will really enjoy him letting loose like that
2702665 borat cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan
2702666 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
2702667 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
2702668 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
2702669 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
2702670 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
2702671 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
2702672 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique
2702673 current economic indicators for the city show a continued low unemployment rate modest job growth at 2 to 3 5 percent for the past five years stable housing costs a stable real estate market and strong private investment
2702674 you cant understate the importance of the tradeport to the local economy

2702678 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2702679 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2702680 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2702681 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2702682 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2702683 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2702684 wo k nnen sie sich in niedersachsen ber politische themen informieren
2702685 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2702686 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2702735 a lot of people are very tired after living through the first sodomy trial which had a chilling effect on the country even until today people thought it was blatant political manoeuvering
2702736 the new sodomy charges against anwar ibrahim are all a political game because he is now a real threat to the prime minister
2702737 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2702738 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2702739 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country

2702780 i would like to inform you that the total expenses registered since 14 october 1997 amounts to 23 million french francs and this is uniquely for the groups we support these are liberation army of rwanda alir 2 300 men ex far 1 565 men and lastly interahamwe 1 250 men
2702781 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris
2702782 so accusing france today of its complicity in those horrible events would logically lead to accusations or self accusations against every other government even though frances role was more direct than the purely passive one of other countries

2702798 no soy yo quien para hacer pron sticos ha afirmado el alcalde pero s tengo que decir que si depende del esfuerzo que han hecho los deportistas de la preparaci n de sus resultados en las pruebas clasificatorias y en las competiciones previas que se han producido y desde luego del nimo y del esp ritu que yo estoy viendo aqu puedo decir que estar amos en condiciones de tener el mejor resultado que hayamos tenido nunca en unos juegos ol mpicos

2702878 the thing i notice most is people using the computers to job search thats a real biggie for us job searches unemployment applications and job applications on line
2702879 our construction workers come in every day and then we dont see them for a long time
2702880 we even have a special purpose computer strictly for job searches job applications take longer so people can use it for two hours instead of one
2702881 ive been looking for two or three months im looking for anything i can do part time care giving restaurant work i honestly dont know what id do without the library and this is how i found the carrows job i saw they were looking for a server
2702882 theres 12 in lompoc right here lompoc unified school district toyota mervyns windscape village apartments the newspaper really doesnt have a lot in there theres more online and people seem irritated if you just walk in to a business
2702883 i see people here almost every day looking for jobs or filling out job applications or working on their resumes
2702884 weve been so involved in this move that it has slowed people down
2702885 we lost a whole lot of people when they built the parking structure we expect a huge boost aug 23 when the new library opens
2702886 from yazoo city miss to indian prairie ill to ashland ky people are buying fewer books and going more to the library
2702887 id be surprised if this werent true all across the country
2702888 just recently i started to get phone calls asking if we have a certain periodical the most recent was kiplinger journal thats new for me they are more a professional type magazine
2702889 i probably bought 10 books a year since i was 35
2702890 five years ago my discretionary income went down so i started using the library for virtually all my books
2702891 because of the library if i take one out and it costs 35 if i dont like it after two chapters i can just take it back
2702892 weve got a lot of good things going in the city and the city is doing well its time to bow out
2702893 its a good move and the right move for now
2702894 we have received many letters cards and e mails from the public with concerns about the project
2702895 as close as it possibly could be to the gainey vineyard public tasting room and event center the potential impact of noise dust lights and aesthetics would be devastating to our business and the rural character and ambiance which have been so crucial to the success of that business
2702896 the long distance between the helicopter hangar and the helicopter parking area requires emergency services personnel to transport their helicopters by dolly to the far east end ramp
2702897 this hinders emergency services by substantially increasing response time significantly increasing security risk and safety
2702898 when you drive down 246 it will all but obliterate views of the santa ynez mountains and thats what defines our valley
2702899 but there will be some landscaping requirements that will soften
2702900 i believe the county is very satisfied that the ceqa california environmental quality act requirements are met
2702901 i frankly as an individual dont see where else theyre going to go analyze further with an eir
2702902 there are some additional phases contemplated in future years that nobody has applied to build
2702903 ceqa does not require environmental review of a project that has no description
2702904 expansion of the airport has potentially significant impacts to my personal business as well as the lifestyle and character of the santa ynez valley
2702905 this is far too important a project not to be fully scrutinized by the general public
2702906 john macarthur never says that to be born again a person must be willing to turn from sin
2702907 lordship salvation is not the childlike faith of john 3 16 it rightly insists upon repentance but wrongly includes a change of behavior in order to be saved no one questions that there must be a sincere change of mind a turning from oneself to the saviour but lordship advocates attempt to make behavior and fruit essential ingredients of rather than evidence of saving faith
2702908 leave stop committing sin and follow jesus at any cost
2702909 i happen to have been privileged enough to be in on the fact that weve been visited on this planet and the ufo phenomena is real
2702910 its been well covered up by all our governments for the last 60 years or so but slowly its leaked out and some of us have been privileged to have been briefed on some of it ive been in military and intelligence circles who know that beneath the surface of what has been public knowledge yes we have been visited reading the papers recently its been happening quite a bit
2702911 this is really starting to open up i think were headed for real disclosure and some serious organisations are moving in that direction
2702912 nasa does not track ufos nasa is not involved in any sort of cover up about alien life on this planet or anywhere in the universe dr mitchell is a great american but we do not share his opinion on this issue

2702934 i have advised the president to choose a dignified exit and resign to save the country from further polarization
2702935 if he did not quit than its obvious i will vote in favour of his impeachment
2702936 i think there would be a settlement no impeachment in view of resignation
2702937 i think he would resign because its a stigma to be the first president who is impeached

2702963 south ossetia broke away from georgia after a chaotic 18 month war that killed 1 000 of a population of 60 000 between 1990 and 1992
2702964 people here blame the united states for providing military support to georgia and emboldening tbilisi to act against south ossetia and there is no ambivalence about the relationship with moscow russia and ossetia have been military allies since at least the 19th century moscow has traditionally relied on its fellow christian ossetians against the many muslim nations in the caucasus as well as against the independent minded georgians
2702965 att erk nna abchazien och sydossetien vore ett stort misstag i s fall visar vi att v rt st llningstagande om kosovo inte bygger p n gra principer sade den ryska handelskammarens chef f rre premi rministern jevgenij primakov

2702968 the bottom line is this georgia should have stepped back from the brink and should still do so if it has a chance
2702969 but russias deployment of such a large and carefully prepared force not only in south ossetia but in the rest of georgia is totally unacceptable

2702984 how will i get there who is my teacher what do i do at kindergarten
2702985 education experts agree that it is important to help preschoolers imagine what kindergarten will be like by telling school related stories viewing videos or reading books about going to school and rehearsing for kindergarten through pretend play
2702986 this toolkit provides practical tools for parents to help prepare their preschooler for the first day of school
2702987 it shows children getting on the school bus meeting teachers figuring out how to finding the bathroom and doing typical activities like listening to stories playing outside and making new friends

2702996 human beings have still not been able to form a human society and have still not learned to move with the spirit of a pilgrim although many small groups motivated by self interest work together in particular situations not even a small fraction of their work is done with a broader social motive by strict definition shall we have to declare that each small family unit is a society in itself if going ahead in mutual adjustment only out of narrow self interest or momentary self seeking is called society then in such a society no provision can be made for the disabled the diseased or the helpless because in most cases nobody can benefit from them in any way in that case there always remains the possibility of some people getting isolated from the collective all human beings must attach themselves to others by the common bond of love and march forward hand in hand then only will i proclaim it a society

2702998 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2702999 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2703000 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2703001 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2703002 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2703003 he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities

2703039 but i do support georgias president mikheil saakashvili and what russia is doing is wrong they must stop
2703040 russia has launched a full scale military invasion of georgia
2703041 stressed that the only way out of the tragic crisis provoked by the georgian leadership is a withdrawal by tbilisi of its armed formations from the conflict zone
2703042 georgias aspiration to join nato is driven by its attempt to drag other nations and peoples into its bloody adventures
2703043 we met twice so far and on all two occasions she won
2703044 je betaalt toch de r4 kaart dus waarom zou het illegaal zijn
2703045 no doubt that the mood has darkened in the last two or three months
2703046 a year ago it seemed reasonable to hope that the worst would be over by now that has not turned out to be the case
2703047 this is why most analysts are now suggesting that the economy will at best only manage to stagnate in the coming few quarters and that the growth prospects through 2009 and into 2010 look no better than anaemic
2703048 the cbi along with most other forecasters has been consistently over optimistic about the economic outlook over the last 12 months
2703049 we are ready to act independently we are ready to enforce order and go further if there is resistance from the georgian side
2703050 we are coordinating our actions with russia our biggest friend
2703051 i have asked russian peacekeepers to reinforce their military presence on the georgian abkhaz border contacts with the current leadership of georgia are bimpossible
2703052 in my opinion they are already elements of some kind of genocide of the ossetian people
2703053 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive
2703054 look at the attention i get its because i throw a football
2703055 but thats what society values thats not what god values i have some eye hand coordination and i can throw the ball i dont think that matters to god
2703056 what the hell are you gonna do about it sit there and bitch and complain and ruin the next two months of your life because something didnt go right for you
2703057 well i dont believe that i dont accept it when people say that i can just compartmentalize them

2703142 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
2703143 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2703144 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2703145 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2703146 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2703147 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2703148 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2703149 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2703150 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2703151 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2703152 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2703153 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2703154 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2703155 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2703156 the one cardinal rule and that is all controls must be accessed using the thread that created them
2703157 silverlight 2 brings support for threading to the browser you can either directly start new threads using system threading thread and system threading threadpool or you can use the higher level and recommended
2703158 a thread waits for a signal by calling waitone on the autoresetevent if the autoresetevent is in the nonsignaled state the thread blocks waiting for the thread that currently controls the resource to signal that the resource is available by calling set calling set signals autoresetevent to release a waiting thread autoresetevent remains signaled until a single waiting thread is released and then automatically returns to the non signaled state if no threads are waiting the state remains signaled indefinitely
2703159 t1 is simulating some work by sleeping for 5 secs
2703160 t2 starting to wait for autoresetevent ar1 at time 0
2703161 when a thread begins an activity that must complete before other threads proceed it calls reset to put manualresetevent in the non signaled state this thread can be thought of as controlling the manualresetevent threads that call waitone on the manualresetevent will block awaiting the signal when the controlling thread completes the activity it calls set to signal that the waiting threads can proceed all waiting threads are released once it has been signaled manualresetevent remains signaled until it is manually reset that is calls to waitone return immediately
2703162 t1 is simulating some work by sleeping for 5 secs
2703163 a statement is atomic if it executes as a single indivisible instruction strict atomicity precludes any possible preemption in c a simple read or assignment on a field of 32 bits or less is atomic assuming a 32 bit cpu operations on larger fields are non atomic as are statements that combine more than one read write operation
2703164 the methods of this class help protect against errors that can occur when the scheduler switches contexts while a thread is updating a variable that can be accessed by other threads or when two threads are executing concurrently on separate processors the members of this class do not throw exceptions
2703165 the system always reads the current value of a volatile object at the point it is requested even if the previous instruction asked for a value from the same object also the value of the object is written immediately on assignment the volatile modifier is usually used for a field that is accessed by multiple threads without using the lock statement to serialize access using the volatile modifier ensures that one thread retrieves the most up to date value written by another thread
2703166 interrupting a thread arbitrarily is dangerous however because any framework or third party methods in the calling stack could unexpectedly receive the interrupt rather than your intended code all it would take is for the thread to block briefly on a simple lock or synchronization resource and any pending interruption would kick in if the method wasnt designed to be interrupted with appropriate cleanup code in finally blocks objects could be left in an unusable state or resources incompletely released interrupting a thread is safe when you know exactly where the thread is
2703167 a blocked thread can also be forcibly released via its abort method this has an effect similar to calling interrupt except that a threadabortexception is thrown instead of a threadinterruptedexception furthermore the exception will be re thrown at the end of the catch block in an attempt to terminate the thread for good unless thread resetabort is called within the catch block in the interim the thread has a threadstate of abortrequested the big difference though between interrupt and abort is what happens when its called on a thread that is not blocked while interrupt waits until the thread next blocks before doing anything abort throws an exception on the thread right where its executing maybe not even in your code aborting a non blocked thread can have significant consequences
2703168 a common question that emerges once you have kicked off some concurrent work is how do i stop it here are two popular reasons for wanting to stop some work in progress
2703169 the system must send an invioce to each user who has placed an order this process should run in the background and should not have any adverse affect on the user interface
2703170 the join method blocks the calling thread until the current thread is terminated it should be noted that the caller will block indefinitely if the current thread does not terminate if the thread has already terminated when join method is called the method returns immediately

2703246 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2703247 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2703248 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2703252 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2703253 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2703254 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2703255 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2703256 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2703306 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2703307 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her

2703505 no loss of life or any damage has been reported so far
2703506 i worked as a printer in the basement of the colorado mental health institute of pueblo
2703507 the human minds natural tendency to find familiar shapes in complex shapes or colors in other words finding a face in the shapes and shadows of a collection of objects
2703508 i think it is reasonable to say that tomorrow will come and go without that happening
2703509 iraqis are combating terrorism with one hand and building a democratic state with the other and this is not an easy job
2703510 we have carried messages to all the countries we visited that iraq is in need of reconstruction in all fields including railways oil electricity bridges and housing
2703511 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing
2703512 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2703513 america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents and human rights advocates and religious activists
2703514 we press for openness and justice not to impose our beliefs but to allow the to express theirs
2703515 this trip has reaffirmed my belief that men and women who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2703516 in english and chinese bush again walked a fine line around controversy
2703517 one al qaida in iraq terrorist died when he detonated a vehicle borne bomb
2703518 all the georgian guys will be leaving for the homeland
2703519 the absence of monitoring on the blogs and the absence of moderators to arbitrate between bloggers and the public raises political and moral reservations about their content
2703520 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale in these conditions our forces conducted redeployment
2703521 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2703522 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2703523 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2703524 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2703525 there was a report that the insurgents were meeting in the village and foreign soldiers surrounded the area
2703526 there was fighting in the village and then helicopters and fighter jets came
2703527 the village elders called me to say they were going to bury their dead and ask nato not to bomb
2703528 if he is out of the picture weapons of mass destruction capability has been set back which would make this one of the more effective strikes in recent years
2703529 i believe that al qaeda has no shortage of people adept with explosives and i know that al masri promulgated training manuals for poisons
2703530 but im not sure how skilled any of proteges may be at synthesizing chemical weapons or toxins
2703531 you need both education and hands on experience to produce decent quality chemical weapons or toxins
2703532 from the u s government perspective he was seen as a major threat his potential to develop primitive weapons of mass destruction was not taken lightly by u s law enforcement and intelligence agencies
2703533 dac ma njuri pe blog la tine nu comenta pe blog la mine
2703534 gt hard recipe for sex there are quite a few of them out there at some point in their lives all men suffer from
2703535 in a nutshell i looked at what incumbents had done
2703536 i have been in the trenches i think it is important that you have been in the classroom and have a college education
2703537 ill make sure that grant money is distributed to the proper programs
2703538 i feel like what hering has done in eight years is not enough she said
2703539 my success and my knowledge my hard work and dedication and the decisions that i have made is what i am all about
2703540 i dont take things lightly and i am not on an ego trip
2703541 you know what im thinking i say what i think and i have no hidden agenda
2703542 if youre a small child and you cant breathe and you dont know why thats extremely frightening
2703543 and if youre a parent and you cant help your child its also extremely frightening the open airways is an opportunity for us to teach kids that they can have as full a life as their non asthmatic peers by simply seeing a doctor and finding out how they can manage their symptoms
2703544 i say the fcat is a reason for schools to have the open airways program
2703545 it helps kids improve their grades and scores and helps with physical education
2703546 our goal is to ensure every elementary school has an open airways program made available to them
2703547 if you make children their own primary caregiver they have better outcomes
2703548 our participants had a 56 percent increase in school attendance
2703549 the average attendance improvement was two days for asthmatic children in six months after the program and for them to gain two days is a big deal
2703550 the program teaches them the breathing techniques that they dont know many dont know the triggers for asthma and they learn that theyre not the only ones with asthma
2703551 programs like this are excellent to teach kids about asthma
2703552 its nice to empower kids and help them learn how to treat themselves
2703553 first of all we the council dont get any face time except for these workshops
2703554 i am telling you this is the way they the council want it
2703555 its the publics opportunity to address the council i want them to address the council after the meeting
2703556 thats not the function of a workshop the workshop is a public discourse
2703557 this is the first time i have to had anything to do with this council and i am embarrassed
2703558 this guy ran on a platform of communication with the public
2703559 when he ward ran for the office he ran stating that his career was in information technology and that most of what he had done and the important things he had done included the fact that he could bring diverse people and diverse ideas together to reach consensus
2703560 i would not be surprised if marion county does have 5 000 to 6 000 homes in that category by the end of the year
2703561 and the shame is a big motivator in all of this people dont want their neighbors to know they cant pay their bills many are paralyzed by whats happening with their homes and do nothing
2703562 people are having a hard time finding housing they are losing their jobs and wages are not going up
2703563 its frustrating when people dont understand that you have families having to decide between food rent medicine or utilities so when they have a chance to secure a roof over their heads for their families it means a lot
2703564 they have been laid off from local companies i have more people from dayco and merrillat or their hours are being cut at places like signature brands
2703565 the primary reason stated for layoffs was industry slowdown or decrease in orders
2703566 they helped save us we didnt have food to make it
2703567 and with food prices rising and gas prices rising if a guy loses his job and has to look for work hes used his gas money after about two days
2703568 just because they pulled up in a new car doesnt mean they dont need our help
2703569 then if they apply its a 30 to 45 day wait so they are coming to us for emergency food
2703570 ive got people calling from all over the county looking for space
2703571 that is a significant increase in a 12 month period
2703572 any downturn in the economy we will see an increase of those needing assistance
2703573 as unemployment goes up as the economy gets worse it will drive more people to reach out for help to maintain their households everything costs more right now im not an economist but if you watch the news you see food prices going up gas prices up everything
2703574 but many of these are from new people seeking help who have never had ask to before
2703575 people were overspending but it was ok because they had the income to support it now they dont
2703576 the housing industry has slowed down has caused other industries to slow down as well people are spending 100 a month more than last year on gas and they did not get 100 more in their pay
2703577 we are seeing 60 percent of our clients coming into file bankruptcy thats about 300 clients a month
2703578 in talking to heads of major banks whats disturbing is there is not any light yet and they dont know when this will be over our agencies are seeing a lot of people in distress
2703579 you always have people who needed help in the past but didnt ask for it and now they will have to ask
2703580 parents tell us when the student misses the bus they cant drive them to school because they dont have the money for gas
2703581 some of the families are hearing that some of the agencies cant help depending on the time of the month if funding or food is available we are trying to anticipate the need going into the new school year realistically we realize families will be under stress
2703582 we try to do a lot of community based presentations to highlight the needs
2703583 i think people will help if they are just told whats needed
2703584 hoje em dia deitar uma multa para o lixo um risco porque o estado tem meios para saber quais os bens do devedor e penhor los
2703585 es una vieja casta que se protege y protege los intereses de los ricos es un verdadero negocio con todo amenazamos de revocaci n inmediata a todo juez que sea sorprendido en flagrante delito pero es un combate dif cil
2703586 just paying rent utilities my car payment and car insurance i dont make enough to cover those bills
2703587 we eat lightly and my family helps out when they can
2703588 we dont go out to eat we live day by day i cant stock up for a month
2703589 they said i did not make enough money to cover the rent next month
2703590 i make too much money to qualify for food stamps or other assistance its just a cycle
2703591 i have to get another job i refuse to speak that i will ever be h o m e l e s s again
2703592 if i have to work all night then thats what i have to do
2703593 we have a very strong broad based economy we have very strong banks
2703594 the australian situation is slightly different to world situation and i think were probably both in distance and in terms of our financial institutions somewhat isolated from the world though still part of the overall financial community
2703595 while the issues are serious i dont think theyre going to bring down any one country
2703596 there is increasing demand for the worlds limited resources of energy particularly oil food and what i think will be a critical issue in the future water
2703597 i think the failure of the doha round of negotiations is a tragedy for the world because if it had succeeded it would have generated additional wealth to the world that could have been reportedly the size of the current chinese economy
2703598 eu sou extremamente agressivo mas hoje eu estava um pouco acuado n o sei porqu eu podia ter imposto um pouco mais o meu estilo de luta
2703599 eu esperava que o coreano fosse o mais dif cil tanto que foi uma luta bem dura mas tem dias em que nada funciona acho que hoje n o era o meu dia tenho que pedir desculpas para as pessoas que acreditaram
2703600 pois daquela xa estabamos no final do per odo 2006 2007
2703601 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2703602 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy
2703603 nicole has just secured team gbs first medal and what a medal
2703604 its not only gold but its team gbs 200th gold medal from the modern olympic games
2703605 emma and sharon did an awesome job in supporting nicole in her race for gold
2703606 nicole has just secured team gbs first medal and what a medal
2703607 its not only gold but its team gbs 200th gold medal from the modern olympic games
2703608 emma and sharon did an awesome job in supporting nicole in her race for gold
2703609 what you cant perhaps quite sense at home is just the torrential rain that was falling on beijing and despite those incredibly tough weather conditions she won so its a wonderful victory and a huge lift for team gb
2703610 normally im good in the rain but the problem was that it was really cold
2703611 the staff at the rcdm provide our soldiers with first class medical care and it is something that we are very grateful for with the whole battalion deployed in afghanistan at the moment having the royal irish band perform here is one of the ways we can show our appreciation
2703612 you have a situation where you have one part of the government objecting to the policy of another one its ridiculous
2703613 unless there are major improvements to the roads where the construction traffic would have to travel then we would have no choice but to recommend refusal of these developments
2703614 intervene and to discuss with them how we can overcome this as soon as possible
2703615 it takes into account local factors which have a direct bearing on major projects such as those proposed or likely to be put forward in future labour has demonstrated a blinkered approach to renewable energy for far too long
2703616 the assembly government is currently in discussion with powys county council and other local authorities across wales
2703617 the assembly government and powys council are aware of the transport issues concerned and have commissioned consultants to look into the matter
2703618 this will be used to inform decision making by the relevant determining authority
2703619 business and industry dont like uncertainty they dont like not knowing whats going to happen tomorrow demand is starting to exceed supply and its a serious issue how we get ourselves there to the point of self sufficiency that should be a key part of the plan
2703620 we have a feeling that the minister has taken the capacity measurements of wind installation for example as given for what they actually deliver and they dont theyre not 100 efficient few things are
2703621 we need an energy plan that stands up to scrutiny which means we make the most use of the existing sources we have
2703622 nuclear has to be considered as part of the mix we also need to invest in our coal reserves which are still considerable
2703623 there needs to be a much more clear and accessible programme around the whole issue of saving energy it needs to be much better adapted for smes
2703624 what type of future we want in scotland in terms of the production distribution and more efficient use of energy and how and when it can be delivered to meet the scottish governments objectives of increasing renewable energy generation and reducing emissions
2703625 were going to develop a major new industry that will serve all the great lakes and possibly other places in the world
2703626 its where we can really say we can get 100 percent of our net annual energy from
2703627 its a heck of a lot easier than drilling for oil
2703628 studies show that the great lakes hold a great potential for wind power development
2703629 its a matter of time before a project like this moves forward
2703630 were certainly interested in seeing if there are ways of making that happen and making it happen in a way thats not disruptive to other users ourselves and the natural ecology of the lakes
2703631 i dont think that many people think windmills are ugly maybe one in 10
2703632 most people like to look at windmills just like they like to look at sailboats
2703633 because the wind resources are the publics resources the water resources are the publics resources
2703634 the county of bay is not going to get into any kind of venture of this sort thats just not our mission
2703635 the linux foundation vient de publier une version b ta dun nouveau programme linux application checker appchecker qui va inciter les d veloppeurs de logiciels ind pendants et autres programmeurs aimer d velopper pour linux
2703636 hes a well polished opponent and i beat him by more than 10 points
2703637 its going to be tough but i just have to stick it out and give it my all
2703638 i think that was a mature performance from a man who isnt 19 yet and against a world bronze medalist
2703639 he showed tremendous maturity billy is a bit more mature than khan to be honest with you amir was a bit quicker with his hands but billy is very good with his head and can adapt to any style
2703640 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
2703641 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
2703642 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them
2703643 since they forced an age limit it has gotten worse and worse the fig is running away from the age problem they set an age limit and now they cant control it
2703644 the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone
2703645 its for good luck but we cant talk about it its a secret if i tell you it will ruin it
2703646 maybe its working it worked today but its too early to tell
2703647 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
2703648 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
2703649 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world and having the government back them
2703650 since they forced an age limit it has gotten worse and worse the fig is running away from the age problem they set an age limit and now they cant control it
2703651 the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone
2703652 i would really hate to see our children and grandchildren burdened by our folly of putting in an antiquated system that may anchor them to ever growing costs and a worsening environment
2703653 we wont propose nor would we support putting a power line through those kind of dense population areas
2703654 we need a much stronger presence for these groups in the schools
2703655 we use the green bags available from publix and other stores
2703656 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2703657 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in florida
2703658 its going to be a grind by the end of the week whoever is left standing is going to have to be someone thats in great shape physically
2703659 not one board member or myself have been contacted about this
2703660 i think you can read between the lines on that one
2703661 the attorney generals office has told us not to give out information
2703662 i dont know of any issues that have come up
2703663 additionally this office is not equipped to conduct investigations grand jury or otherwise
2703664 we employ no investigators rather we rely on police agencies to provide our investigative services
2703665 the das not going to convene a grand jury unless he has something
2703666 its a sad day for this county when the district attorney wont meet with a citizen group
2703667 it seems the district attorney in franklin county is more than willing to investigate wind companies
2703668 i said we had evidence of wrongdoing in steuben county including members of the legislature which is something entirely different
2703669 we felt sasha made great progress in this past year and our coach showed great confidence in playing him the second half of the season assuming he continues to work as hard during the off season as he has in the past i dont see any reason that trend wouldnt continue
2703670 you lot are going have to change things you cant all be in the final
2703671 to celebrate the launch of nike sportswear niketown new york has completely redesigned its 5th floor dedicating the entire space to nike sportswear
2703672 words contain meanings like a bottle holds a perfume both convey messages that can be interpreted and experienced in an immense variety of different ways each of them communicates an essence a thought a shared experience messages in bottles have always signified belief and a hope for the future using advanced serigraphic techniques evolved from traditional printing methods the original comme des garcons 2 pebble shaped bottle has been lacquered in black to contain silver words of peace freedom and love in several languages the result is a deep matt black colour surface holding an infinate mesage of hope stamped in silver words
2703673 hans en huub willen mede namens loes en de kinderen iedereen die hun medeleven heeft laten blijken inzake het plotse overlijden van harald hartelijk danken
2703674 although being on the front two rows is important im disappointed not to continue our string of front row starts this year
2703675 i am feeling increasingly confident on the loose but its nice to be back on asphalt
2703676 that said germany is a special case the rain and widespread corner cutting can make the conditions so muddy that it is sometimes almost like a gravel event its not my favourite sealed surface rally but i believe we can target a top finish
2703677 i was very pleased with my c4 wrc after our pre event tests and asphalt tends to suit me we will be looking for a good result and a podium finish would be a positive outcome for both citroen and us
2703678 he is absolutely the most intense guy in the world
2703679 but thats how you make great stuff you dont make great stuff by wearing a nice sweater and drinking a martini you make great stuff by digging your fucking teeth in
2703680 since bioshocks come out i was a huge fan of his and i think he really liked the game and he felt is was something that was greatly interesting i cant speak for sam you know but thats my interpretation of what he said
2703681 the spielbergs of our industry the amount of revenue that guy generates when you meet him hes a really self effacing guy
2703682 into evanston township high school and have a columbine shooting
2703683 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2703684 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2703685 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2703686 i came around the last corner and i could see the gold medal race 300 meters up ahead of me
2703687 we werent expecting the breakaway in the beginning so we had to burn a couple of guys for that
2703688 but the team ran well even though we didnt win a medal
2703689 i felt good all day and i was really aggressive but it was a bit of a pot luck at the end
2703690 it was all about following the right wheels and staying out of the wind overall im really happy with how we rode it was just an awesome race
2703691 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2703692 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2703693 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2703694 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2703695 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2703696 your ancestors left israel in a ship and they were shipwrecked in india they were jews but they settled in india in the shipwreck they lost their torahs and they forgot their religion
2703697 when nana left bombay for karachi after the partition of india
2703698 she left behind her birthplace and community for a new life she became the third wife in a joint muslim household all three families under one roof
2703699 i couldnt tear myself away from 3 quarks daily to the point of neglecting my work congratulations on this superb site
2703700 i have placed 3 quarks daily at the head of my list of web bookmarks
2703701 just wanted you to know im one of many who reads and enjoys 3 quarks almost daily

2703704 i had some unlucky stuff go on yesterday and i wanted to come back and make up for it
2703705 its been good racing with the pros there in and near boulder
2703706 its really strong in colorado a lot of good guys there we race the local criterium and you get tom danielson and guys like that guys who should be at the tour it was a perfect lead up to this
2703707 i just sort of made an attack at the bottom of the first climb just to see how theyd react
2703708 and a few guys came with me and we were working well a few other guys came across and so we sort of kept rolling everyone was working quite well together and we just kept working right to the finish and sprinted it out
2703709 but a few guys came across and got the break moving again and got us all motivated to go to the finish
2703710 then it was sort of just whatever you had left for the last 150 meters everyone gave it everything and it paid off it wasnt really tactical just whatever you had left
2703711 and then about 150 meters to go i got zoe fraziers wheel and got around her and sprinted to the finish
2703712 i havent been riding too much i just wrecked about a month ago and broke my collarbone
2703713 this feels really good i was speechless coming across the finish line
2703714 one girl went banuelos with 150 meters to go and then i just went around her i knew i had to get around her she was the one girl i was looking for she was second yesterday and had a pretty good sprint
2703715 i got on his wheel and then i jumped at the 150 meters to go

2703752 estoy muy feliz empezar as es muy importante el equipo griego es un rival muy dif cil y jugamos muy bien abrimos el marcador poco a poco grecia fall muchos tiros libres no s por qu pero si no los hubiera fallado creo que tambi n habr amos ganado aunque por menos diferencia
2703753 en la l nea que se hab a previsto pero la intenci n es que el equipo vaya mejorando a lo largo del campeonato porque todav a quedan cosas que se pueden hacer mejor empezar unos juegos ol mpicos el primer partido es dif cil para todos los equipos en los ltimos minutos por ejemplo no tuvimos balance defensivo dejamos que los griegos corrieran no hubo l neas de pase y algunas precipitaciones esas son las cosas en las que el equipo tiene que mejorar dentro de la propia competici n
2703754 este equipo se basa mucho en la defensa a to quiere que mantengamos una alta intensidad defensiva y ofensiva y eso es lo que hemos hecho en la segunda parte hemos podido correr y anotar con m s facilidad que en el primer tiempo hemos cogido una buena ventaja y hemos ganado a un equipo muy bueno pero es s lo un partido de grupo
2703755 no ha sido una victoria en un partido de cuartos que es cuando empieza lo verdaderamente importante
2703756 ha sido muy emocionante jugar contra la subcampeona del mundo y ganar de esta manera ha sido un partido muy duro era la subcampeona del mundo deb amos plantear un inicio muy fuerte en el segundo cuarto hemos logrado una ventaja de entre cinco y diez puntos que hemos mantenido y en la segunda parte hemos subido la intensidad en el partido nadie se fija en si tienes 17 a os o m s tienes que jugar igual independientemente de la edad los estadounidenses juegan en la nba pero a nosotros no nos impresionan aunque ahora s lo pienso en el partido contra china
2703757 en la primera parte fuimos capaces de controlar el partido defendimos bien y complicamos mucho el ataque espa ol no les dejamos que corrieran conseguimos controlarles en ataque y movernos relativamente bien ante su defensa pero luego no pudimos repetirlo en el segundo tiempo
2703758 espa a tom ventaja muy r pido se march en el marcador y ya no fue posible recortar de nuevo el marcador jugamos una buena defensa pero no fuimos capaces de atacar bien por el gran trabajo de espa a tambi n cometimos unos cuantos errores que nos costaron el partido
2703759 cometimos muchos fallos en los tiros libres y en ataque y en la segunda parte comenzamos igual pero luego les dimos muchas oportunidades espa a es un equipo muy fuerte y adem s les dimos facilidades para que hiciera contraataques r pidos
2703760 esta ma ana recibimos la noticia por supuesto estamos encantados y agradecemos su decisi n de continuar en los juegos ol mpicos
2703761 si el mundo aprendiera alguna lecci n de lo que hice nunca m s habr a guerras

2703780 the more technical fabrics provide a sense of british culture but more specifically of the c p company and stone island led casual or football hooligan sub culture specifically of the late 80s and the 90s on which the over all aesthetic of the collection is based my work is generally very structured and technical in terms of construction to the extent of being sculptural using traditional wools such as harris tweed not only creates yet another unexpected contrast against the structural aspects of the pieces it also facilitates the moulding and distortion of the fabric by using traditional tailoring heat application techniques

2703927 we still clearly at the moment havent been able to get our game structure going and our style going against the better sides in the competition and probably the sides whove played a bit of finals footy
2703928 what you need to be able to do is either stand up and have your structure stand up or be able to fight out a really dour one on one struggle when conditions were like today

2703982 although i am very pleased to hear him listening to those around him i saw several quotes from school board members and parents who praised him for saying i dont know and not having a ready made plan
2703983 personally im all for a ready made plan that includes giving back more power to teachers and principals incorporating the community in the schools finding ulterior means for educating students more interested in disrupting schools than planning for their future preventing and not merely handling violence in schools and bringing back skill classes like shop keyboarding and home ec for students not on a traditional college track
2703984 while it was nice to hear that mr green didnt think he had all the answers i would have been more confident if he had a firm vision of direction for guilford county schools

2703986 i think his lack of specifics and plans may be his greatest strength

2704082 die justizministerin hat alle strittigen teile entfernt dieser von experten mitgestaltete entwurf der in den ministerrat kommt ist in allen wesentlichen bereichen bereits akkordiert wenn sich die vp nun trotzdem aus wahltaktischen gr nden verweigern sollte so hat sie zu verantworten wenn wesentliche verbesserungen beim gewalt und opferschutz gar nicht oder erst mit deutlicher verz gerung in der n chsten legislaturperiode kommen
2704083 eine hervorragende gelegenheit w re die von seiten der innenministerin ausstehende novelle zur strafregisterdatei als voraussetzung f r die sexualstraft terdatei vorzulegen damit sich diese regierung mit einem gesamtpaket zum gewalt und opferschutz verabschieden kann wie das von experten und praktikern seit langem gefordert wird
2704084 es soll doch nicht so sein dass notwendige verbesserungen des opferschutzes daran scheitern dass die vp wom glich versucht ihre eigene s umigkeit bei der strafregisterdatei durch die verunm glichung des gewaltschutzgesetzes zu kaschieren
2704085 ich hoffe sehr auf die kr fte der vernunft innerhalb der vp und dass diese erkennen dass mit der raschen umsetzung des gewaltschutzgesetzes wesentlich mehr im kampf gegen gewalt und f r den opferschutz gewonnen werden kann als etwa mit der immer wieder vorgebrachten forderung nach einer herabsetzung der strafm ndigkeit
2704086 die ank ndigungspolitik von seiten der sp ist verwunderlich von seiten der sp wurde es verabs umt eine sinnvolle effiziente und zukunftsweisende l sung fertig zu erarbeiten f r halbe l sungen und unfertige pakete stehen wir nicht zur verf gung
2704087 so wie es aussieht wurde es von seiten der sp auf dieses scheitern angelegt um husch pfusch mit halbfertigen entw rfen winken zu k nnen all das hat system die sp betreibt populismus und anbiederung indem zum einen unfertige und undurchdachte forderungen aufgestellt werden oder sie konfrontiert den ministerrat mit halbfertigen gesetzesentw rfen zu denen sie gezielt die verhandlungen platzen hat lassen dieses man ver ist sehr durchsichtig
2704088 wenn jetzt behauptet wird dass bis auf die anzeigenpflicht bereits alle punkte fertig verhandelt worden seien dann ist das eine sehr k hne behauptung die jeder grundlage entbehrt und schlichtweg falsch ist
2704089 mir geht es um ein effizientes sinnvolles und wirksames gesamtpaket das tats chlich eine deutlich strengere handhabe gegen sexualstraft ter erm glicht und deutlich st rkeren schutz f r die menschen in unserem land bietet
2704090 uns geht es um tats chlichen schutz der kinder nicht um eine abgeschw chte deutlich zu wenig wirksame form die nur jene ber cksichtigt die unter ausn tzung ihrer t tigkeit kinder sexuell missbraucht haben uns geht es um die potenzielle gefahr die von sexualstraft tern ausgeht es kann doch f r ein berufsverbot keinen unterschied machen ob die sexualstraftat innerhalb oder au erhalb des beruflichen zusammenhanges begangen wurde
2704091 uns geht es um pr vention denn jedes verbrechen in diesem bereich ist eines zu viel
2704092 das paket ist nicht ann hernd fertig gedacht und keineswegs fertig gestellt und auch nicht fertig verhandelt ich kenne den neuen entwurf noch nicht kann mir aber nicht vorstellen dass all diese punkte darin ausger umt sind da die verhandlungen dahingehend nicht einmal gef hrt wurden eine husch pfusch aktion nach eineinhalb jahren tr delei ist alles andere als seri s seri se politik ist aber gerade in diesem bereich wichtig denn hier geht es vor allem um den schutz unserer kinder
2704093 innenministerin fekter kann sich ihre frisierte kriminalstatistik sparen es ist mittlerweile aktenkundig dass das innenministerium mit einem trick die kriminalstatistik verf lscht w hrend fr her einzelne delikte von ein und derselben t tergruppe auch statistisch einzeln erfasst und gewertet wurden wird jetzt folgenderma en getrickst dass mehrere delikte von gruppen zu einem einzigen delikt zusammengefasst werden und damit nat rlich in der statistik weniger delikte verzeichnet werden wenn sich fekter mit solchen frisierten und falschen zahlen selbst bel gen will ist das ihre sache wenn es aber um die sicherheit der sterreicherinnen und sterreicher geht h rt sich der spa auf wir haben nicht zuletzt durch die ffnung der schengengrenze einen rekordanstieg der kriminalit t und die innenministerin ist bis heute s umig ma nahmen zur kriminalit tsbek mpfung zu setzen

2704129 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
2704130 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
2704131 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
2704132 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2704133 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2704134 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2704135 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2704136 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2704137 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2704138 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2704139 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2704140 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2704141 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2704142 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2704143 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2704144 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2704145 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2704146 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2704147 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2704148 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2704149 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2704150 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2704151 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2704188 the internet is a perfect venue for our industry because our business relies on conversation and we engage multiple stakeholders
2704189 the greatest contribution of our founding fathers was the institutions they gave us to make us what we are today
2704190 it is the democracy open society the elected legislature and the fiercely independent judiciary rule of law and secularism enshrined in the constitution which make us what we are
2704191 the current it revolution is a product of the vision of the founding fathers who laid emphasis on education and we look ahead today with confidence more than every before
2704192 we plan to increase the corpus of the fund from the earlier 100 million to around 125 150 million we also plan to combine 2 3 more sectors besides agri
2704193 we are also looking at the possibility of having a third investor such as bilateral and multilateral funds

2704320 girls do have wiis nintendo at 9 i wanted a canopy bed and a pony my daughter wants an iphone this is the world our girls live in there is more of a challenge more media more culture to assimilate and tease out and so much of it is very appealing
2704321 theres something to be said about pastimes that girls have always had to remember some of that too its nice that sometimes they can have very solitary creative pursuits without having to blog about it
2704322 for a girl to be earnest about what she likes to speak up it is kind of daring to include a recipe in a book for girls when we know so much about how girls are limited its daring to reclaim these things this everyday daring like raising your hand in class

2704335 i cannot imagine american electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
2704336 the anger and toxic obsessions overwhelmed even the most reserved beltway wise men
2704337 h er advisers couldnt execute strategy they routinely attacked and undermined each other and clinton never forced a resolution s he never behaved like a chief executive and her own staff proved to be her achilles heel
2704338 what is clear from the internal documents is that clintons loss derived not from any specific decision she made but rather from the preponderance of the many she did not make
2704339 i dont mean to be an asshole but changes to important statements and other critical campaign communications simply have to go through howard

2704360 that just goes to show that all of that hard work pays off its just an honor to go over and fight in the olympics
2704361 ive gotten so much support from my fans family and friends and fans
2704362 i just hope it stays that way for the rest of my career
2704363 being so far from home and away from my family has been the hardest part
2704364 i have my dad my family everybody back home everyone thats supporting me they are all in my heart
2704365 it means a lot not a lot of people get to be in the position that im in right now
2704366 i know a lot of people back home would love to be in this position right now so i have to take advantage of it put all the hard work together and make it happen

2704368 maybe not clinically diagnosed but it was such a heartbreaker to lose two opportunities for a medal back to back

2704373 its a lot different than last year a lot different than last year and it will show but thats not what its really about its about just going out and trying to make plays and trying to win games
2704374 it was an experience it was a learning experience i got a chance to see how fast the game was i only got a taste of it in practice
2704375 you know it really was tough because you couldnt get in a pass rush rhythm
2704376 they werent dropping back much they wanted to run the ball and we held our own
2704377 well i thought the whole offensive line did a great job in the run game and in the pass game and that includes max
2704378 he was excited about his performance and we were excited as well
2704379 goyer i had this notion of what if you found out you were a twin and you were being haunted by your unborn twin thats eerie i just started researching twins and one thing led to another six months later we were making the movie

2704401 if you watch the olympics gymnastics this year you may be confused by the new scoring system which will let athletes score 14 17 or even higher the new rules are heavy on math and employ two panels of judges one for technical difficulty which adds points up from a score of zero the other for execution and technique which starts at 10 0 and subtracts for errors the two numbers are then combined for the final score as one judge put it the system rewards difficulty but the mistakes are also more costly the new rules were adopted after south korea protested a scoring at the 2004 olympics

2704410 auf jeden fall wollen wir vermeiden dass unsere musik als ironisierung von heavy metal angesehen wird im gegenteil dies ist unser tribut an diese tollen songs
2704411 wir waren sehr berrascht wie aufgeschlossen und freundlich die klassischen musiker auf unsere musik reagiert haben sie waren berhaupt nicht egoistisch wie man es so oft in der popwelt findet

2704426 when i ask what do you think of player x in our organization or what about player y in another organization hes already built up quite a large library based on his amateur stuff this allows him to increase his portfolio
2704427 they project how these guys are going to be but they never get to truly see how these guys will be in their pro stage its a very good process hes going through to contribute at the pro stage also it will make him even better at what hes doing

2704430 you only have seven rounds now so theres a reduction in the amount of players selected
2704431 now you have tier 2 players and high school players that may not have gotten drafted before when you had nine rounds a guy might have been an eighth round pick now he goes undrafted
2704432 we want to make sure we have a full player pool

2704456 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2704457 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2704458 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2704459 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2704460 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2704461 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2704462 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2704463 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2704510 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2704511 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2704512 maybe it is fate when i was at chelsea i played twice against my previous club porto and i played three times against my previous club barcelona maybe that was on his terrys mind and i will be drawn against my previous team again
2704513 this is a great experience for me after eight months away from football it is fantastic to be back im still in love with english football i still feel a big relationship with chelsea
2704514 pauls utterly enchanted with nancy and hes already rolling the idea of marriage around in his head
2704515 he adores everything about her he thinks shes the one and told stella as much
2704516 he said what would you say if i asked nancy to be the next mrs mccartney and she joked back at least shes financially independent
2704517 the whole family thinks nancys great a vast improvement on pauls last love interest
2704518 nancy and bruce have been separated a long time but her relationship with paul has spurred them on to finally dissolve the marriage
2704519 theyve moved on with their lives and bruce approves of paul its all amicable
2704520 theyve been with each other 24 7 a perfect way to see if theyre suitable for marriage
2704521 pauls not about to rush into anything but hes happier than hes been for years theyve got so much in common he knows heather was a mistake although he loves their little one bea more than anything and wont be put off by a bad divorce experience

2704530 everyone was either at home or had packed up and moved out of the city
2704531 people are really really scared even on the bus theres people on the bus but speaking to each other joking laughing and this is not georgian normality because georgian normality is noisy and crazy and people laughing and joking
2704532 they inspectors look and say training was inadequate for the operator we dont know how they came to some of their conclusions yet we definitely want to focus on the future and part of focusing on the future is knowing what happened in the past

2704536 it was a nice quiet trial and hes come through it well and so far has done everything weve wanted him to
2704537 the big weight at rosehill would have knocked him around too much i was just looking to get him fit
2704538 well give him another trial on friday and a week after that well run in that group race warwick stakes
2704539 weve got plenty of options for him well just see how he goes
2704540 i watched his races and i know dermot weld is one of the top trainers in europe
2704541 he told me he liked this horse and that was good enough for me
2704542 rene has beaten me a couple of times in other races so when i had the chance to get him on this horse i took it
2704543 dont be surprised if you see the horse back for the breeders cup turf

2704552 they do not have ultimate flexibility with regard to changing whatever it is that theyre doing
2704553 they can watch their cost side as much as they can keep their costs down so they can maintain their margins but the best medicine for the small business in central wisconsin would be for the overall economy to improve unfortunately they dont have a whole lot of control over that sort of thing

2704555 issues with the structure and scope of the new government are likely to take centre stage
2704556 the search warrant affidavit is a collection of innuendo and raw suspicions and should have never been made public
2704557 at this stage of criminal investigations the law presumes innocence and imposes heavy burdens on prosecutors and fbi agents not to prematurely release information about matters occurring before the grand jury
2704558 if they have problems they can bring it up to the court
2704559 if his story is true then he has essentially admitted to lying to get the cost estimates admitted to lying to the cabinets office of inspector general admitted lying to the fbi and if it happened in 2006 then he lied on his income tax returns
2704560 very qualified counsel for the defense for this case will make a lot out of
2704561 i think his initial story to the fbi was a product of very understandable human nature fear concern for his job and a lack of counsel
2704562 my hope on behalf of jim is that the government appreciates his cooperation and his efforts and will treat him appropriately

2704570 however by 2 00 a m on saturday the militants allegedly came back to arogbo and agadagba obon with nine speed boats in army uniform and fully armed and went into the homes of pdp leaders to kidnap them they destroyed all the doors at the house of the ssgs father they also attacked her sister and took away money from her room
2704571 we are discussing with them we have met community leaders we have met the leaders of the militants both in ondo and delta states we hope the release of the people will be possible we have made it clear to them that no one of us has any weapon they said we are hiding them but we still believe we will reach a compromise
2704572 the so called criminals are afraid that some leaders of the area are out to dislodge them and they are fighting back
2704573 why are they afraid that some people have guns they are just frightened that the people are prepared to flush them out of the area and they think the next thing to do is to kidnap their kinsmen
2704574 the mend men are blackmailers they are going into militancy to collect money from government
2704575 mimikos victory is a clear manifestation of our earlier declaration that the election was rigged by dr agagu
2704576 we would not release the captives until those allegedly in possession of arms are made to surrender all the guns and other ammunition in their possession and stop terrorizing ijaw land
2704577 to the police after a careful consultation with elders and leaders of ijaw nation across the country
2704578 however the fact that the spokesman of mend jomo gbomo dissociated his group from the statement lends credence to the fact that the so called mend in ondo state is a creation to unleash terror on the peace loving people of the niger delta region of the state

2704595 it is impossible to describe the depth of our sadness and shock in this tragic hour
2704596 our delegation comes to the games as a family and when one member of our family suffers a loss we all grieve with them
2704597 its hard to put it in words thats not something thats supposed to happen
2704598 we said a prayer for them in the locker room i get goose bumps talking about it its something obviously that just changes the events right now for the olympic games
2704599 appears to be an isolated act with no connection to the olympics
2704600 no reason to believe that the assailant targeted the victims as american citizens
2704601 its far too early to suggest that this has anything to do with the olympics

2704685 laura and i just had the great joy and privilege of worshipping here in beijing china
2704686 you know it just goes to show that god is universal and god is love and no state man or woman should fear the influence of loving religion
2704687 once again i had a very uplifting experience going to a church
2704688 it was a spirit filled feeling as you know i feel very strongly about religion and im so appreciative of the chance to go to church here
2704689 have constantly had discussions about human rights and political freedom he knows my position

2704693 soltanto in italia si contano come morti sul lavoro al fine di poter dare benefici assicurativi da parte dellinail anche le morti che avvengono per incidenti stradali capitati mentre si va al lavoro o mentre si torna a casa a fine giornata morti che evidentemente sostiene nulla hanno a che vedere con la sicurezza in fabbrica
2704694 il momento di smetterla dice di criminalizzare gli imprenditori italiani se infatti estrapoliamo gli incidenti che avvengono in agricoltura e in edilizia vedremo che in italia la sicurezza delle aziende manifatturiere ai migliori livelli europei
2704695 le dichiarazioni di castelli sono pericolose e prive di fondamento un vero attacco alle norme sulla sicurezza sul lavoro
2704696 anzich cercare dichiarazioni a effetto il sottosegretario farebbe bene a preoccuparsi del fatto che il suo governo sta manomettendo le buone leggi che riguardano salute sicurezza e lavoro nero
2704697 castelli si vergogni di fronte allitalia e chieda subito scusa a tutti coloro che hanno avuto un parente morto o ferito per cause di lavoro
2704698 castelli e gli altri rappresentanti del governo oltre al business e agli appalti pensino anche al valore della vita umana
2704699 singolare che si voglia estrapolare i settori dellagricoltura e delledilizia perch sono lavoratori di serie b forse perch in questi settori sono spesso impiegati gli immigrati il sottosegretario si occupi di pi delle condizioni delle strade che i lavoratori sono costretti a percorrere e investa in trasporto pubblico anzich in polemiche
2704700 su un tema serio come quello delle morti bianche non bisogna mistificare la realt

2704703 it was a physical linkage during the times that they were used for underground railroad portals but now it is the portal the linkage to our history
2704704 to explore to develop and promote the african american cultural heritage experience
2704705 common sense will tell you that you know that the house you live in requires constant maintenance and these homes are 200 years old or so
2704706 what made this particular place important in the underground railroad history is it being across the river from st louis mo
2704707 st louis mo was one of the places where you could buy and sell slaves and was a point of escape for desperate folk
2704708 human beings have very little value in relations to the work that they can do and the product that they can produce
2704709 there were places like black enclaves where they could hide in plain sight

2704711 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008 said daniel mudd fannie maes president and chief executive
2704712 to help us manage through the most difficult us housing market in more than 70 years
2704713 i pierced it with a rusty nail i hope jesus tetanus shots are up to date
2704714 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
2704715 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
2704716 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2704717 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
2704718 i dont think thats a very good idea for us right now mr kupper told abcs inside business program
2704719 if you look at the benefits of doing that it would really be in a relatively small part of our company the synergies between our two companies are not particularly large right now

2704721 our second quarter results reflect challenging conditions in the housing and mortgage markets that began in 2006 and have deepened through 2007 and 2008 said daniel mudd fannie maes president and chief executive

2704723 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
2704724 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
2704725 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2704726 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2704727 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2704728 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
2704729 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2704730 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2704731 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2704732 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2704733 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2704734 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2704735 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2704736 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2704737 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2704738 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2704739 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2704740 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2704741 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2704742 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2704743 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2704744 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2704745 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2704746 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2704747 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2704748 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2704749 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2704750 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2704751 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2704752 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
2704753 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
2704754 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
2704755 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2704756 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2704757 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2704758 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2704759 it started off bad and it looks like it will only get worse
2704760 the reports that came out after the bashing wasnt a fair reflection of the school because we are a great school and we have brilliant teachers
2704761 weve heard of people committing suicide because they had been bullied or harassed
2704762 es hat spa gemacht wir wollten in der ersten viertelstunde das spiel entscheiden um sp ter nicht in schwierigkeiten zu kommen
2704763 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2704764 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2704765 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2704766 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2704767 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2704768 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2704769 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2704770 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2704771 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2704772 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2704773 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2704774 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2704775 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2704776 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2704777 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2704778 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2704779 der likud ist heimat man verl sst seine heimat nicht
2704780 die demokratie die schlechteste form der regierung ist au er all den andern arten die von zeit zu zeit ausprobiert wurden
2704781 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2704782 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2704783 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2704784 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2704785 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2704786 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2704787 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2704788 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

2704805 i just dont agree with taking the fans away theyre putting a handcuff on the fans
2704806 it says a lot about who they are as people they obviously know the definition of unconditional love
2704807 its a little too quiet if its supposed to be a big season
2704808 footballs all about team and people looking out for each other its not a little like family for me it is family and i think you get a lot of your strength from that
2704809 i know my family at home and my football family here at ohio state mean everything theyve made me what i am
2704810 i say he really reminds me of jim brown because of his size and strength
2704811 and the way he brushes people off of him people can hit him and they just fall off of him some people dont think hes got that speed but when he gets out in the open he seems able to run away from people jim brown was my hero and youll probably think im crazy but when i watch chris wells run thats what comes to mind
2704812 barring any unforeseen injury ohio states sensational running back chris wells will win the award this year
2704813 he is the best running back in the country he will put up phenomenal numbers on the season and the buckeyes will make it back to the national championship game
2704814 beanie had to deal with a lot of hype and publicity when he came here because he was such a great high school player and just about everyone knew about him
2704815 thats a lot of pressure on a young player but i think he handled it really well he contributed right from the start
2704816 it was rainy and kind of sloppy that day but beanie didnt seem affected by it at all we just saddled him up and rode him
2704817 he was just outstanding he was the difference in the game
2704818 i think beanie has a chance to become one of the all time great running backs
2704819 he certainly has the size speed and agility not to mention a killer stiff arm move im not quite ready to put him with the all time all timers yet but thats only because he has had only one year being the man and that was while he was hurt most of the year
2704820 there were times when i felt like my wrist was going to fall off then throughout the season the more games i played the more comfortable i became its gonna be great to go out there and know you are totally healthy
2704821 ive said it before beanie definitely reminds me of jim brown and i dont say that to put extra pressure on him or anything but thats who comes to mind beanie is a big powerful strong back with speed that surprises people and his gait is a lot like jim browns
2704822 i do think about winning the heisman i started thinking about it way back in high school
2704823 but my most important goal is always for this team to do well if i can help that happen well see how that heisman thing all works out right now my mind is focused on this team
2704824 i think sometimes if you have a bad play you may be a little bit more reserved about taking chances
2704825 he had a bad play in the game that got intercepted because quinn and receiver syndric steptoe werent quite on the same page and i think that probably he wanted to be a bit more conservative as he went down
2704826 but basically i tell him to take what the defense gives you and if the defense gives you short passes you take short passes you dont try to force it down the field when theyre defending deep

2704828 when youre losing like this you can only come up with so many things
2704829 one run doesnt get it done unless you shut them out and we havent seen one of those in a long time
2704830 if you took a pitch it was a strike if you swung it wasnt a very high percentage pitch to hit
2704831 he got out of a tough jam with some tough hitters up there early and when he got out of that jam i thought we were going to win the ballgame
2704832 first batter was a close 3 2 pitch that could have gone either way
2704833 it went their way miguel tejada hit a great sinker ill take that pitch any day on anybody he got on base and once you get to the meat of their order with berkman and carlos lee coming up and youve got a couple men on base its really tough to pitch out of that i really didnt want to give in to any of them

2704839 now thats how much it costs a week so one car has gone from 2 500 to 10 000 pesos a month multiply that by three and you get 30 000 pesos we just cant afford it anymore

2704848 it was perfect its a dream come true i want to thank all the people whove been there from the start ive worked so hard i am so happy
2704849 there somewhat is relief the day is over we overcame so much it was all kind of a whirlwind
2704850 and we got the nerves out and the mistakes out
2704851 i knew things were happening i couldnt control and that were obviously not very good
2704852 it was a little bit hard to go out from there
2704853 a few of us had tears in our eyes because we know how badly she wanted to be out there we said lets do it for her lets do it for our families lets do it for the people back home
2704854 well come back strongly in the team finals and fight for it
2704855 ive been doing it so well in training i think i just pulled so hard and i overrotated
2704856 i am very satisfied with the chinese girls performance if i can give them a score i would say 70 percent mainly for he kexin falling off the uneven bars its a big pity for her
2704857 maybe she was nervous because she wanted to perform her best
2704858 wheres a fun place to go to in fengyuan thats not a bar

2704860 oil is at a tipping point it is an exaggeration to cry that a bubble has burst it is a break
2704861 the market is simple reflecting the fundamentals of supply and demand markets participants are considering the world slowdown the deterioration in expectations for the growth worldwide
2704862 when investors realized how much demand was increasing they bid up prices and when they realized how much inflation was increasing they bid up prices further
2704863 now growth rates are declining throughout the world the market overreacts to that too
2704864 you should convince millions of chinese and indians who are willing to live an american way of life that they dont have to buy cars they dont need a fridge

2704872 the current noticeable weakening in the yuan has never happened before
2704873 previously when the dollar rebounded the yuan would either move sideways or appreciate more slowly
2704874 we attribute it to the shift in domestic policy the central bank has adjusted its policy for a slower speed in appreciation
2704875 the signal from central banks statement for second quarter monetary policy meeting is quite clear the change in phrasing is obvious
2704876 use various monetary policy tools to create good conditions for stable relatively fast growth
2704877 we do not believe the chinese authorities will defy the law of gravity to engineer a sustained renminbi depreciation despite persistent forex inflow
2704878 but it is likely that the central bank may fine tune its intervention policy to effect a slower appreciation in the short run
2704879 the economy is still in good shape with consumption spending and export growth both much stronger than almost anyone expected a few months ago
2704880 the arguments in favour of appreciation pre date recent concerns over inflation simply put china cannot rebalance its economy with a severely undervalued currency we expect rapid appreciation to continue
2704881 in this sense it is also a question of a violation of international law as soon as you start to go down the road of military action
2704882 it would be good if moscow would stop adding oil to the fire
2704883 it would be stupid for them to block each other

2704924 but to no ones surprise berroas been terrible despite his 2 4 performance tonight even in the emergent circumstances that have allowed him to play a 206 267 243 line coming into tonight in a pennant race just isnt going to cut it of the 72 men whove played shortstop in the big leagues this year berroa is 67th in vorp
2704925 while berroa hasnt been as bad as i feared with the glove hes been middle of the pack indeed his 975 fielding would tie him for 15th of the 20 shortstops with enough at bats to qualify for the batting title if he were qualified as well

2704994 i really enjoyed the final 25 minutes of the first half not only for the way we played the ball around but also because of the way we won it back
2704995 from further confrontations and violent retaliations that could degenerate into a wider conflict
2704996 this bout is the best for me because its a fairly tough draw with the world championship bronze medallist kilicci a cuban carlos banteaux correa and i think the 2007 world championship silver medallist thailands too ive got a long road ahead
2704997 i think that was a very mature performance by the youngest member of our team hes not even 19 yet hes got a good brain and hes tremendously quick
2704998 the guy hit me with so many right hooks in the last three fights but he didnt touch me this time i could see it in his eyes after two rounds he was surprised that i was still there
2704999 i couldnt lose to him anymore four times would have been bad i figured out that when he kate has finished attacking he just stands there and thats when i can attack

2705009 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2705010 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2705011 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2705012 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2705013 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2705014 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2705015 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2705016 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2705069 if the minister baptized you repeating the titles of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit he did not make you and episcopalian or presbyterian but he did make you a catholic
2705070 there can be no dialogue with the georgian leadership they are criminals
2705071 when youve got people that are 30 year plus incumbents its smarter to sit on the fence than pick a horse that doesnt win
2705072 the big problem with don is that he used the money he was given for legal fees thats not why people contributed to him so that created incredible uproar amongst the money group
2705073 if you support the lieutenant governor the governor comes with that support so thats one thing but if the congressman ends up winning
2705074 neither of them are raising lots of money people are holding their powder
2705075 the club for growth is one of the most extreme groups in washington d c
2705076 this is a group that does not want to spend any money on alaskans period to me thats wrong a congressman must represent the people of alaska not some special interest group in washington d c
2705077 the large dollar donors are concerned about the potential vindictiveness of the congressman
2705078 im not opposed to earmarks im opposed to earmark abuse
2705079 and the abuse of the process where earmarks are dropped in without public scrutiny tarnishing alaskas reputation
2705080 thats primarily what don youngs war chest is made of is political action committees and gaming interests from puerto rico and louisiana and the like
2705081 sean i think is hopelessly na ve when it comes to the earmark process what a congressman or woman is supposed to do
2705082 or if hes not hopelessly na ve then hes simply pandering to this club for growth i mean a congressman is supposed to be working on ways to bring projects to this state
2705083 when your colleagues in the congress ask for an investigation of you things dont bode well for alaska
2705084 that means people are kind of distancing themselves people in congress and those are the folks that are going to be deciding alaskas fate
2705085 theres a little biblical saying you know judge not that ye be not judged yourself
2705086 i would absolutely bring projects to alaska that have been subject to public scrutiny and the light of day
2705087 i would think its going to be a close contest between young and parnell
2705088 ledoux is the wild card if she does well then the handicap has to go to young if she doesnt do well then parnell
2705089 don might still be able to pull this one off because of gabrielle ledoux which should make supporters of sean parnell pretty concerned because sean was the odds on favorite a few months ago
2705090 the stumbling block right now is that tdx is refusing to sell the city power
2705091 they are spending a lot of money to have wind turbines sitting out there
2705092 our loans wouldnt even allow us to sell that power plant
2705093 in order for us to make our loan payments we need to sell power
2705094 we are not in it for the money we are in it to provide electrical service to the village
2705095 what are we supposed to do turn off the lights
2705096 it was my fault i shouldnt have been on that trail
2705097 as soon as i stopped they looked up and started bolting for us
2705098 i kept looking over my shoulder but they kept coming
2705099 i thought if i get off the trail maybe theyll lose me
2705100 she just pounced right through those trees and was on top of me
2705101 she just stayed there for a moment then took off real fast
2705102 ive got to get out i dont have time to lie here
2705103 i thought im going to have to hurl myself into the road here
2705104 if it wasnt me it could have been someone else
2705105 im really glad its getting warm and not cold an ice age would be really bad
2705106 species cant adapt or keep up in an evolutionary sense because everything is happening so fast
2705107 the changes are all happening faster than the models had predicted
2705108 this place if you stay here more than a week they dont provide toilet paper
2705109 people do make choices and some of those choices arent so good
2705110 i want to show them something to think ahead on things to kind of organize things
2705111 thats really hard when theyre in the shelters and moving from place to place
2705112 i hear a lot of people say why cant they go to mcdonalds and get a job flipping hamburgers but mcdonalds has criteria you know they do criminal background checks even if they have a job there they cant pay rent and gas and child care
2705113 i told him if you even think of doing that again think of me sitting on your shoulder
2705114 when you are a young mother you look for guidance and me not having family here i looked into the community
2705115 there was times we sat on the floor for two hours just waiting for him to calm down
2705116 she basically said youre a loving man youre a good man and im pulling for you because i know you can do this she kept saying that
2705117 no other person understood what i was going through she knew she just did

2705120 luck wasnt on our side we played well against korea but lost we were definitely the better team today but once again we didnt get anything out of the game we just arent having any luck at the moment but thats football sometimes you win sometimes you dont so ill take the defeat sportingly
2705121 they really battled their way into the game but after going 1 0 up we found some fluency in the later stages it was the nigerians and not us who wilted in the heat which made me very proud of my team
2705122 i knew what i was told about the war was totally false
2705123 in 1968 i came back and dan was across the hall at rand
2705124 he had been a total hawk in vietnam but everything about him seemed shattered it was as if he was trying to grow himself back he was going through a metamorphosis he was very tortured there was no way he could justify the war anymore
2705125 i knew that he was the one person with the combination of guts and passionate concern about the war who would take the risk of helping me
2705126 there can be no dialogue with the georgian leadership they are criminals
2705127 from further confrontations and violent retaliations that could degenerate into a wider conflict
2705128 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2705129 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
2705130 russia further escalated its aggression overnight using weapons on unprecedented scale in these conditions our forces conducted redeployment
2705131 we heard a plane go over and then a big explosion
2705132 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2705133 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2705134 complete genocide putin also said georgia had effectively lost the right to rule the breakaway province an indication moscow could be preparing to fulfill south ossetians wish to be absorbed into russia
2705135 in order to prevent the circumstances in which ukraine could be drawn into a military conflict ukraine reserves the right to bar ships which may take part in these actions from returning to the ukrainian territory until the conflict is solved
2705136 it makes a third party involved and its quite unexpected
2705137 last year we were able to hold a roster spot open for gary as he attempted to make a monumental comeback after he underwent a knee scope last week we are unfortunately not in a position to hold a roster spot this year we are releasing gary today in hopes he will be able to continue his rehab and get back into the nfl either with another team or possibly with the browns gary has made tremendous strides thus far and we believe he can play professional football again in the future
2705138 upon the conclusion of our investigation the big ten is secure in its belief that these games were not compromised
2705139 home plate looked to be about 120 feet away when i came in the game
2705140 i was as nervous as i was when i made my big league debut but after i threw the first strike it seemed just like another game

2705164 does oil effect the u s dollar or does the dollar strength or lack thereof drive oil prices
2705165 in a nutshell this inverse relationship exists because global oil prices are denominated in dollars thus as the usd declines oil producers are paid fewer units of foreign currency in exchange for oil they must compensate for this decline in real revenues by raising the price of oil in dollars
2705166 bei manchen habe ich mir gedacht das beste w re ich schicke sie wieder nach hause
2705167 no me sorprende es algo para lo que nos hab amos preparado es algo para lo que estoy mentalizado me qued a dos puntos de mi r cord personal pero bueno mi marca internacional es precisamente sta ya he tirado hasta 681 en el selectivo nacional de febrero
2705168 la primera serie estuve muy bien me fui al primero y luego tuve una flecha mala un descuido de mi parte que me baj hasta el lugar n mero seis y ah me mantuve cerca hasta la ltima serie donde tir un 58 que es muy bueno ellos se confiaron y yo me sub al primero
2705169 vamos bien tenemos que tomarlo con tranquilidad es todav a la clasificaci n pero es un buen par metro hemos trabajado bien y ha resultado entonces vamos a seguir trabajando en estos d as para llegar bien a la ltima ronda
2705170 me da confianza y tranquilidad quedar rankeado en el primer lugar mucha gente ya se fija en m es una cosa nueva para nosotros porque todo el mundo va a estar pensando en nosotros y queri ndonos ganar
2705171 esta fue una buena prueba la pasamos bien pero tenemos que controlar el nerviosismo para pasar mejor la que sigue y tirar los puntos que podemos tirar
2705172 creo que llego a la siguiente ronda m s tranquila porque no inici desconcertante as que estoy segura de que har lo mejor
2705173 fue bueno iniciar mi participaci n en los ol mpicos con mi peor prueba los 400 combinados con el fin de sacar todos los nervios y ahora estoy mucho m s relajada para dar lo mejor en las modalidades que mejor domino los 400 y 800 metros libres
2705174 estuve en el carril ocho y es l gico que todos esperaban que terminara en el ltimo lugar porque ah ponen al peor tiempo de inscripci n pero tambi n es el carril de las sorpresas y super a tres de las rivales del heat
2705175 la carrera fue bien sal bien aunque hac a mucho calor prefiero que haya viento
2705176 el cambio de ritmo que realiz mi rival fue determinante no pude reponerme
2705177 me confi mucho ante la egipcia yo tuve un trabajo fuerte y entrenamiento adecuado que pens era suficiente para ganar aprend que jam s debo subestimar a ning n rival
2705178 estoy muy contento fue una carrera muy emotiva la de hoy sab a que iba a ser muy dura iba muy pareja en los 200 as que estir un poco m s mis brazadas en el pecho y en ese punto el libre ya es una bajada pura adrenalina
2705179 muchas de las mejores del mundo quedaron fuera en la primera ronda
2705180 mientras pasaban las pruebas mis nervios bajaron poco a poco y confi en mis instintos en ganar la de oro
2705181 cuando se fragmenta la selva y s lo queda algo parecido a islas de terrenos arbolados tambi n se fragmentan las colonias de primates las poblaciones quedan desequilibradas por ejemplo con muchos machos o muchos individuos viejos
2705182 esta ruptura de las colonias unida a tener menor terreno con alimento hace que mueran lentamente sus habitantes o que sobrevivan una o dos generaciones
2705183 que la ganancia industrial petrolera quede en pemex cerca de 200 millones de pesos en ganancias una reforma en presupuesto que permita a la empresa usar sus ganancias acabar con los pidiregas y que el gobierno federal tenga que financiar su d fict como lo hace cualquier gobierno del mundo que no es a costa de sus paraestatales sino reduciendo gastos recaudando mejor fonde ndose en el mercado y emitiendo bonos
2705184 la iniciativa consiste en que esos documentos se analicen se discutan con la gente en las comunidades eso quiere decir que habr a un trabajo de corresponsabilidad con las instituciones
2705185 una de las formas en que es m s notorio el riesgo es en la lengua que es un patrimonio que se piensa m s vivo pero es tambi n el m s expuesto otro muy importante y que no es muy visible es la cuesti n de los rituales toda esta cosmovisi n que hay y que tiene que ver con los sistemas de producci n como el ma z

2705188 podamos cumplir con este promedio ojal podamos recuperarlo y tener m s un mayor promedio
2705189 se da en un momento en que el gobierno federal ha redoblado su esfuerzo en los medios ha redoblado la propagandizaci n de un supuesto apoyo ciudadano a su propuesta de reforma
2705190 el 27 de julio nos enfrentamos a una gran campa a pero ahora es mayor la promoci n oficial en la televisi n que tenemos en contra lo vemos a diario sin embargo confiamos en que la movilizaci n ciudadana que hemos estado promoviendo logre mantener el nivel de participaci n y ojal lo podamos acrecentar
2705191 esperaremos el lunes para dar a conocer el resultado total dado que tenemos mucha zona rural en esa consulta particularmente en puebla y oaxaca que son muy extensas en yucat n tambi n hay mucha zona rural en tabasco pensamos que no vamos a tener mayor problema pero la idea es que se reciba informaci n durante el d a informaci n de instalaci n de c mo va la afluencia de los incidentes que puede haber todo el d a va a estar funcionando el centro de c mputo
2705192 yo creo que s estos estados pueden dar un levant n muy fuerte a la participaci n y sin descartar a yucat n campeche quintana roo que son m s chicos tambi n colima los tres estados fuertes van a ser estos y yo creo que s estamos en condiciones de elevar un poco el nivel
2705193 que estar n operando este domingo para que sea un xito la consulta tanto en las mesas como en la promoci n que se ha estado haciendo

2705206 were in danger of seeing the 2008 election stolen again as in 2000 and 2004
2705207 the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for president and vice president of the united states is denied or in any way abridged
2705208 if two thirds of the voters in a state vote for a candidate from party a and one third vote for a candidate from party b and the states winner take all rule gives all of the states electors to party a then one third of the voters have been disenfranchised in violation of amendment 14 section 2 of the us constitution
2705209 weve witnessed in election after election how some states have used the winner take all formula to prevent the votes of political ethnic and other minorities from being counted
2705210 by refusing to challenge electoral college malapportionment in 2000 and 2004 which blocked democratic electors from voting in those elections the democratic partys leaders abandoned tens of thousands of their own voters just as they failed to challenge the election irregularities in florida and ohio in 2000 and 2004
2705211 will they fail to challenge malapportionment again in 2008 and hand the republicans another victory barack obama would not be the democratic nominee if not for the democratic partys proportional assignment of primary delegates the winner take all provisions in the general election present the distinct possibility that mr obama in 2008 will win the popular vote by a considerably larger margin than did gore in 2000 but will repeat the democratic loss in the electoral college
2705212 if proportional assignment is considered by democrats to be vital to democracy in their primary elections why wont they fight for it in the general election
2705213 the democratize the electoral college program exposes the hypocrisy and fraud behind charges that the mckinney campaign might spoil the democratic presidential tickets chances of winning democratic leaders should have to explain why they choose to ignore 13 additional electors from southern states that theyd gain through the green partys presidential electors project why is the green party fighting to give voice to democratic voters that the democratic party will not fight for let me be clear were not doing this to assist barack obama but to foster real democracy and voter participation and to offer cynthia mckinney as the truly democratic choice for all the people
2705214 americans dont vote for president instead we vote for an electoral college which was created in the late 1700s to expressly increase the power of the slave states and which it is still doing

2705239 this whole affair has been a moving feast from the time it was first mentioned but there is a potential impact from all this on 15 other counties not just kent
2705240 we are only in the firing line so to speak because we managed to reach the final but any other of the first class counties could be going through this and instead of us facing up to the implications of what appear to be pretty major inconsistencies

2705257 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2705258 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2705259 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2705260 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2705261 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2705290 continuation of the pregnancy would or would be likely to endanger her life or health
2705291 justified in requiring a reliable independent and medically sound opinion as to the life or health of the pregnant woman
2705292 it is possible that a future enactment by parliament that would require a higher degree of danger to health in the latter months of pregnancy as opposed to the early months
2705293 the situation respecting a womans right to control her own person becomes more complex when she becomes pregnant and some statutory control may be appropriate
2705294 supports a permissive approach to abortion in the early stages of pregnancy and a restrictive approach in the later stages in the early stages the womans autonomy would be absolute her reasons for having an abortion would however be the proper subject of inquiry at the later stages of her pregnancy when the states compelling interest in the protection of the foetus would justify it in prescribing conditions
2705295 it is important to see health in terms of the whole human being
2705296 the personal aspirations of the woman as well as social factors could be taken into account
2705297 if the fetuses are recognized in this bill it could bleed into peoples consciousness and make people change their minds about abortion

2705346 im mittelpunkt standen diesmal die menschenrechte von betroffenen gruppen die ausweitung von geeigneten pr ventionsma nahmen und die behandlung von aidskranken um dem ziel des universellen zugangs bis 2010 n her zu kommen
2705347 das problem der zu teuren medikamente ist bekannt vor allem auch in lateinamerika wo viele l nder auf vorbildliche weise an hiv aids erkrankte menschen therapieren und zunehmend patientinnen auf neue und teurere medikamente umgestellt werden m ssen mexiko zum beispiel gibt 90 seines aids budgets f r medikamente aus da originalpr parate zu hohen preisen eingef hrt werden m ssen
2705348 das ist dringend n tig um alle behandlungsbed rftigen in therapie zu bringen
2705349 zwar wurde die behandlung in den vergangenen jahren ausgeweitet doch noch immer sind weltweit etwa sieben millionen menschen davon ausgeschlossen das sind 70 derer die die behandlung ben tigen
2705350 die konferenz hat deutlich gemacht dass der kampf gegen hiv aids zu gewinnen ist wenn wir unser engagement verst rken und auch innovative finanzierungswege gehen
2705351 diesem beispiel sollten andere industriel nder folgen denn so k nnen neue umfangreiche mittel bereitgestellt werden die dringend ben tigt werden
2705352 menschen mit hiv m ssen vollwertige mitglieder in kirchengemeinden sein d rfen
2705353 wir sind der meinung dass die kriminalisierung von homosexuellen und sexworkern die situation verschlimmert indem sie die betroffenen in den untergrund treibt und stark stigmatisiert
2705354 die wissenschaftler haben klar gemacht dass es vorerst keine wunderwaffe geben wird und das leben vieler menschen nur zu retten ist wenn eine infektion rechtzeitig erkannt und behandelt bzw durch prophylaxe oder richtiges verhalten verhindert wird
2705355 wir kennen aber waffen die gemeinsam einiges ausrichten k nnen
2705356 es gibt viele anzeichen daf r dass dieses wirtschaftliche problem fortschritte in der aidsbek mpfung gef hrdet
2705357 hiv positive menschen die schlecht ern hrt sind haben gr ere probleme mit den medikamenten und sind h ufiger gezwungen die behandlung zu unterbrechen gleichzeitig werden sich mehr arme m dchen und frauen prostituieren m ssen um ihre familien zu ern hren
2705358 um kinder und ihre eltern am leben zu halten brauchen wir beides eine gesunde ern hrung und medikamente deshalb suchen hilfsorganisationen wie world vision nach wegen um in der krise schon bei kleinstkindern unterern hrung zu verhindern und den familien mittel an die hand zu geben mit denen sie ihr einkommen bzw ihr nahrungsangebot verbessern k nnen
2705359 wir haben in afrikanischen projekten zum beispiel festgestellt dass regelm ige hausbesuche durch geschulte nachbarschaftsnetzwerke und gruppentherapien den psychischen zustand der kinder und ihrer betreuer sehr gut stabilisieren k nnen und das ist neben der befriedigung der grundbed rfnisse eine wichtige voraussetzung daf r dass die n chste generation ein eigenes leben aufbauen kann trotz aids

2705373 80 km beneath the snake river plain seismic waves travel slower than just about anywhere on earth at this depth
2705374 this is much colder than other presumed mantle plumes such as hawaii
2705375 if it doesn t have clear source as it rises eventually the plume will die out
2705376 regardless of the ultimate origin of the plume the volcanic hazard remains about the same
2705377 i would suspect there is life in the yellowstone hotspot to me ruling out a future catastrophic eruption would be foolish
2705378 perhaps not as doomed as trying to prove the world is flat
2705379 one thing i can say is that i sure hope it doesnt work because if you could extract energy from the vacuum it would mean that the vacuum is not stable for normal physicists
2705380 the definition of the vacuum is that its the lowest energy situation possible it has less energy than anything else
2705381 would mean the universe is far more unstable than we ever dreamed
2705382 when a microwave enters a supercluster it gains some gravitational energy and therefore vibrates slightly faster
2705383 later as it leaves the supercluster it should lose exactly the same amount of energy but if dark energy causes the universe to stretch out at a faster rate the supercluster flattens out in the half billion years it takes the microwave to cross it thus the wave gets to keep some of the energy it gained as it entered the supercluster

2705395 what delmer youve gotta be kidding youve gambled more than this every day youve been in the ranching business youve been bucked off horses run over by cows youve walked home when your truck broke down worked jobs made a living against all odds youve gambled on cattle prices and the weather and the price of hay this horserace is nothing at all compared to being in business for yourself so if were all gambling anyhow lets at least have a little fun at it
2705396 lower prices at the pump by increasing offshore drilling here at home
2705397 i have some news thats going to anger you its going to chill you as you know brave republicans in the house are continuing their battle to force nancy pelosi to bring the democrats back to have an up or down vote expanding the opportunity to drill for oil in anwr and offshore they continue to make their points and they continue to fight this is an issue as you know as i have mentioned it to you its the issue that can change this entire campaign around americans are angry and its not just at the price of oil and gasoline it is the related price increases everything that happens as a result of that food has gone up practically everything has gone up airline transportation everythings gone up because of the price of oil the oil is coming down but its a market thats still fluid and nobody can predict whats going to happen and whether the price continues to come down or not weve gotten a warning here we need to do what we can to expand our own supply and the republicans in the house are doing everything they can to see to it that this happens
2705398 however in the senate there is a new bipartisan coalition called the gang of ten five democrats five republicans led by senator lindsey graham on the republican side
2705399 theyre doing all of this while these brave republicans in the house are fighting the odds in their own revolution trying to stop pelosi and force her back so that we can move forward on a bill that would expand drilling five republican senators join five democrats and basically hand the democrats everything they want
2705400 weve got a bunch of republicans who have been trained by the presidential nominee of their party that the way to advance yourself with the media and in washington social circles is to agree with democrats this is just mind boggling well keep you posted on any further developments
2705401 if i am for freedom why should i give away anything not saying this is freedom versus tyranny but gosh folks if this keeps up were going to have tyranny well i think we do in terms of property rights and any number of things so heres a bipartisan effort that mccain didnt support this one included drilling limitations on drilling and mccain wants to open up drilling its become his issue and these five republican senators last friday just nuked it at least in the senate
2705402 now this deal by the way this gang of ten deal get this
2705403 it would put up more barriers to drilling which is what the democrats want because they want no drilling period five republicans go along with it
2705404 yeah this did catch mccain by surprise because it put him in a very ironic situation
2705405 im not for tax increases and there are too many tax increases in this bill thats not the way
2705406 i left off the most important thing to look at
2705407 folks i cant explain it you can make up whatever explanation you want theyre stupid they want good coverage in the media whatever it is

2705421 ive been on a mission ever since every index ive brought to the marketplace tackles a specific investment problem
2705422 rons a genius and we know theres a place for this in the used this same strategy successfully in separate accounts for years
2705423 sri investing is very popular were hoping to bring that interest weve seen on the equities side to bonds
2705424 the corporate bond market is skewed to intermediate maturities we made sure to cover the most popular maturity bands with these products
2705425 we took those top quartile companies and looked at their bonds then we created all sorts of rules
2705426 so if a corporation had five bond issues and only one of them had 250 million outstanding wed only take that one
2705427 bonds that run out of call protection will get priced to their call dates and that causes distortions in valuations
2705428 in bond land usually the worst a companys credit the more it issues bonds so you dont want an index to be heavily skewed to the problem issuers as happens with a market cap weighted index
2705429 everywhere you look major institutions are passing policies to protect themselves against terrorism and political risks but thats very tough to do
2705430 with the liquidity problems in corporate bonds theyre forced to come up with some sort of sampling methodology and that just leads to tracking error issues
2705431 i think etfs are a great investment vehicle especially as more people move to tactical allocation
2705432 by contrast tactical allocations are more dynamic in nature theyre more responsive to changing investment situations
2705433 its like sports when youre way ahead you dont keep piling up the score you change tactics and play more defensively
2705434 thats what were seeing major corporations doing these days as well as more individuals
2705435 it doesnt have anything to do with whats going on in the market tactical allocations are made as you assess where you are in your long term investment plan
2705436 its part of a periodic process of taking stock of how far youve come and where youre going
2705437 it was really hard to shoot in the rain but there is nothing we can do about it because we cant change the weather
2705438 i felt a little nervous and a little disappointed but finishing fourth is always better than fifth
2705439 this medal is good for georgia especially in times like these
2705440 i was very nervous as its been very difficult for my people it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace
2705441 soon i will look into the eyes of my players to make sure they have retained the hunger they need to succeed
2705442 if success has gone to anyones head and they show signs they are ready to rest on their laurels they will soon be on their way
2705443 at this particular time we are not in the best position fitness wise but it doesnt concern me unduly
2705444 there is a great quality in the squad and a great enthusiasm a lot of them are exhilarated by winning the european cup
2705445 it doesnt matter that manchester united beat us in the last match they are different games they need different approaches
2705446 this will be nothing like that game things are different now and we have the chance to win
2705447 weve had good preparation for the pre season and now we really want to win this first match at wembley
2705448 of course we will approach this game very differently to nigeria we have to be a lot more committed we have to play and work hard and make sure we do our best
2705449 they are a very good side but i believed we would win the fa cup if i didnt believe i would not play football you cannot just give up

2705455 it is strongly in the public interest to protect this system

2705460 i was very nervous today as its been very difficult for my people
2705461 it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace

2705557 at the time of the american revolution the east india company flag would have been identical to the grand union flag
2705558 the design of the grand union flag is similar to the flag of the british east india company indeed the design in use since 1707 when the canton was changed from the flag of england to that of great britain was identical save for the fact that the number of stripes varied from 9 to 15 that that flag was potentially well known by the american colonists has been the basis of theory of the origin of the grand union flags design
2705559 may have been identical in appearance to the beic flag

2705568 there are two basic ways to terrorize people the first is to do something spectacularly horrible like flying airplanes into skyscrapers and killing thousands the second is to keep people living in fear through constant threat warnings security checks rhetoric and stories of terrorist plots foiled by the diligent work of the increasingly intrusive department of homeland security

2705587 i know the support group wanted certain wording at the garden and that has been included
2705588 this was a sensitive issue and we appointed an independent facilitation team to work on it
2705589 they came up with some very sensitive wording and included the support groups chosen words
2705590 some people had an idea that the council had already decided what they were going to do with the memorial

2705609 the law is designed for the benefit of us oil companies
2705610 if approved it would take things back to where they were before the nationalisation of iraqs oil in 1972
2705611 the people as well as all the members of parliament believe that this law is not only for robbing iraq of its oil wealth but also for the division of iraq
2705612 people have started understanding that at first they believed that america had come to give them freedom and democracy
2705613 and they have now started to understand that america did not come at all for that they came for the oil and the best proof of that is this oil law

2705826 that is because you will not admit or believe that faith exists or that there is a possibility that a deity or gods exist because as soon as you do that everything you are saying to support your argument fails
2705827 there is no evidence to suggest one or many gods exist

2705874 a lot of the guys had met him todd bachman and wiss elisabeth is part of the volleyball family and we have all known her for a long time we really felt the loss as being one of our own and thats why it hurt so much we were so close to them
2705875 the bachman family were great volleyball fans wiss was a wonderful player and they watched her play almost every match they were great followers and supporters of the mens and womens team
2705876 the best way we can honour them is to compete every day and play hard every day and enjoy and love the game of volleyball as they did

2705884 sehampir hampir se seorang hamba itu kepada tuhannya ialah semasa ia sujud
2705885 tidak salah seseorang berdoa bagi keperluannya sepanjang solat wajib keperluannya di dunia ini dan di akhirat sewaktu berdiri duduk dan sujud
2705886 pandangan kami ialah diizinkan untuk berdoa se panjang solat untuk semua perkara sebagaimana diizinkan berdoa di luar solat sama ada urusan spiritual atau du niawi
2705887 peliharalah kamu segala solat fardu khasnya solat wusta asar dan berdirilah kerana allah dalam solat kamu dengan khusyuk
2705888 dan apabila manusia disentuh oleh sesuatu bahaya mereka segera berdoa kepada tuhan dengan rujuk kembali bertaubat kepada nya kemudian apabila allah memberi mereka merasai sesuatu rahmat daripada nya tiba tiba sebahagian dari mereka mem persekutukan allah
2705889 dalam solat ada doa yang dikhususkan seperti doa iftitah sebelum membaca surah al fatihah ketika berdiri doa ketika duduk antara dua sujud dan doa ketika bacaan qunut dalam solat subuh
2705890 cuma hendak memandai mandai menambah doa lain dalam solat fardu adalah tidak harus kerana boleh jadi menyebabkan berlaku penambahan rukun atau perbuatan bidaah dan sudah tentu akan terbatal solat
2705891 orang yang mengerjakan solat adalah ia bermunajat mengadap dan merayu kepada tuhannya

2706284 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2706285 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2706387 allah telah memberitakan di dalam ayat ini tentang kesempurnaan hikmah nya
2706388 orang yang paling keras cobaannya adalah para nabi kemudian setelah mereka kemudian setelah mereka
2706389 bersegeralah kalian menuju pengampunan rabb kalian dan kepada surga yang seluas langit dan bumi yang telah dijanjikan bagi orang orang yang bertakwa kepada allah
2706390 kemudian allah subhanahuwataala memerintahkan untuk bersegera menuju ampunan nya dan menuju surga seluas langit dan bumi lalu bagaimana dengan panjangnya yang telah dijanjikan oleh allah subhanahuwataala kepada orang orang yang bertakwa merekalah yang pantas menjadi penduduknya dan amalan ketakwaan itu akan menyampaikan kepada surga
2706391 perintah berlomba lomba dalam kebajikan merupakan perintah tambahan dalam melaksanakan kebajikan karena berlomba lomba mencakup mengerjakan perintah tersebut dengan sesempurna mungkin dan melaksanakannya dalam segala keadaan dan bersegera kepadanya barang siapa yang berlomba lomba dalam kebaikan di dunia maka dia akan menjadi orang pertama yang masuk ke dalam surga kelak pada hari kiamat dan merekalah orang yang paling tinggi kedudukannya
2706392 bersegeralah kalian menuju amal shaleh karena akan terjadi fitnah fitnah seperti potongan gelapnya malam di mana seorang mukmin bila berada di waktu pagi dalam keadaan beriman maka di sore harinya menjadi kafir dan jika di sore hari dia beriman maka di pagi harinya dia menjadi kafir dan dia melelang agamanya dengan harta benda dunia
2706393 hai orang orang yang beriman mintalah tolong kepada allah dengan penuh kesabaran dan shalat sesungguhnya allah bersama orang orang yang bersabar
2706394 sesungguhnya amal amal tergantung pada niat dan setiap orang akan mendapatkan sesuatu sesuai dengan niatnya

2706397 bahwa abu bakr jika mendapati sebuah masalah maka beliau melihat kepada kitabullah jika beliau beliau mendapatkan sesuatu yang memutuskan perkara itu maka beliau putuskan dengannya dan jika beliau mengetahuinya dari sunnah nabi maka beliaupun memutuskan dengannya bila tidak beliau ketahui beliau keluar kepada kaum muslimin dan bertanya kepada mereka tentang sunnah nabi pada perkara yang tersebut dan bila hal itu tidak mampu menyelesaikan maka beliau panggil tokoh tokoh kaum muslimin dan para ulama mereka lalu beliau bermusyawarah dengan mereka
2706398 para qurra adalah orang orang majelisnya umar dan ahli syuranya baik yang tua maupun yang muda
2706399 umar memasukkan aku bersama orang orang tua yang pernah ikut perang badr maka seolah olah sebagian mereka marah dan mengatakan mengapa umar memasukkan pemuda ini bersama kita padahal kita pun punya anak anak semacam dia maka umar mengatakan hal itu berdasarkan apa yang kalian ketahui yakni bahwa dia dari keluarga nabi dan dari sumber ilmu
2706400 ya allah pahamkan dia tentang agama dan ajari dia takwil
2706401 ketika itu saya berada di tempat singgahnya abdurrahman bin auf di mina dan beliau disisi umar dalam sebuah haji yang merupakan akhir hajinya abdurrahman mengarahkan pertanyaan kepada saya apa pendapatmu jika kamu melihat seseorang datang kepada amirul mukminin umar bin al khaththab hari ini lalu ia mengatakan wahai amirul mukminin apakah anda melakukan sesuatu pada fulan yang mengatakan seandainya umar telah meninggal maka aku akan membaiat fulan demi allah tidaklah baiatnya abu bakr dahulu kecuali hanya sesaat lalu langsung sempurna maka mendengar laporan itu umar marah lalu mengatakan sungguh saya insya allah akan berdiri sore ini di hadapan manusia dan akan memperingatkan mereka dari orang orang itu yang ingin merampas urusan mereka maka abdurrahman mengatakan wahai amirul mukminin jangan kau lakukan karena musim haji ini menampung orang orang hina juga sesungguhnya merekalah yang akan lebih banyak dekat denganmu disaat kamu berdiri di hadapan mereka dan saya khawatir jika engkau bangkit dan mengucapkan sebuah ucapan lalu dibawa terbang oleh setiap yang terbang mereka tidak memahaminya dan tidak mendudukkan pada tempatnya maka tundalah hingga engkau pulang ke madinah karena madinah adalah rumah hijrah dan rumah as sunnah sehingga engkau dapat mengkhususkan ahli fiqh dan tokoh tokoh masyarakat lalu kamu katakan apa yang mungkin kamu katakan sehingga ahlul ilmi akan memahami ucapanmu dan menempatkannya pada tempatnya
2706402 saya tidak mendapati orang yang lebih berhak terhadap perkara ini kekhilafahan lebih dari orang orang itu yang rasulullah meninggal dalam keadaan ridha terhadap mereka
2706403 dan para imam setelah nabi wafat bermusyawarah pada hal hal yang mubah dengan para ulama yang amanah untuk mengambil yang paling mudah
2706404 janganlah dia bermusyawarah jika terjadi suatu masalah kecuali dengan orang yang amanah berilmu dengan al quran dan as sunnah dan riwayat riwayat dari shahabat dan setelahnya serta berilmu tentang pendapat pendapat para ulama qiyas dan bahasa arab
2706405 semestinya seorang pemimpin menjadikan seseorang yang menerangkan kepadanya tentang keadaan masyarakatnya disaat dia sendirian dan hendaknya orang tersebut orang yang bisa dipercaya amanah cerdas dan bijaksana
2706406 hendaknya ahli syuramu adalah orang orang yang bertakwa dan amanah serta orang orang yang takut kepada allah
2706407 akan tetapi wajib bersama penguasa itu ada seorang yang pantas berijtihad sehingga dia penguasa itu red dapat bertanya kepadanya dalam permasalahan hukum
2706408 wajib bagi para pemimpin untuk bermusyawarah dengan para ulama dalam hal hal yang tidak mereka ketahui dan pada perkara agama yang membuat mereka bingung juga bermusyawarah dengan para pemimpin perang pada urusan peperangan dengan tokoh masyarakat pada urusan yang berkaitan dengan maslahat masyarakat dan dengan para menteri dan wakil wakilnya pada perkara kemaslahatan negeri dan kemakmurannya
2706409 para ulama berkata kriteria orang yang diajak musyawarah jika dalam perkara hukum hendaknya seorang ulama dan agamis dan jarang yang seperti itu kecuali orang orang yang berakal oleh karenanya al hasan mengatakan tidaklah akan sempurna agama seseorang kecuali setelah orang yang bertakwa dan amanah serta orang yang takut kepada allah
2706410 syarat syarat yang harus ada pada mereka ada tiga pertama keadilan yakni keshalihan agamanya dengan berbagai syaratnya kedua ilmu yang dengannya dia dapat mengetahui siapa yang berhak menjadi pemimpin dengan syarat syarat kepemimpinan ketiga ide yang bagus dan bijak yang dengan itu dia bisa memilih yang paling pantas untuk menjadi pimpinan
2706411 engkau adalah seorang yang pandir melemahkan semangat menghendaki runtuhnya barisan kaum muslimin dan membuka celah bagi musuh musuh muslimin
2706412 engkau adalah orang yang terjatuh dari jalan ini dan menghendaki kehancuran secara halus
2706413 maka janganlah kalian mentaati orang orang yang mendustakan ayat ayat allah
2706414 dan orang orang yang mengikuti syahawatnya bermaksud supaya kalian berpaling sejauh jauhnya dari kebenaran
2706415 orang orang yahudi dan nasrani tidak akan ridho kepadamu hingga kamu mengikuti agama mereka
2706416 katakanlah hai orang orang kafir aku tidak akan beribadah kepada apa yang kalian ibadahi dan kalian bukan penyembah robb yang aku ibadahi dan aku tidak pernah beribadah kepada apa yang kalian ibadahi dan kalian tidak pernah pula menjadi penyembah robb yang aku ibadahi untuk kalianlah agama kalian dan untukkulah agamaku
2706417 dan bahwa yang kami perintahkan ini adalah jalan ku yang lurus maka ikutilah dia dan janganlah kalian ikuti jalan jalan yang lain karena jalan jalan itu mencerai beraikan kalian dari jalan nya yang demikian itu diperintahkan allah kepada kalian agar kalian bertaqwa
2706418 jika allah mengatakan kepada rasul nya padahal beliau adalah orang yang paling sempurna akalnya paling banyak ilmunya dan paling bagus idenya maka bermusyawarahlah dengan mereka dalam urusan itu maka bagaimana dengan selain beliau
2706419 dan urusan mereka diputuskan dengan musyawarah dan mereka menafkahkan sebagian yang kami rizkikan kepada mereka
2706420 tidaklah sebuah kaum bermusyawarah di antara mereka kecuali allah akan tunjuki mereka kepada yang paling utama dari yang mereka ketahui saat itu
2706421 diriwayatkan oleh al bukhari dalam al adabul mufrad dan ibnu abi hatim dengan sanad yang kuat
2706422 dan pasti nabi bermusyawarah pada hal hal yang belum ada nash atau ketentuannya dari allah dimana tidak boleh bagi beliau melakukan musyawarah pada hal hal yang telah ada ketentuannya dari allah dan ketika allah tidak mengkhususkan urusan agama dari urusan dunia ketika memerintahkan nabi nya untuk musyawarah maka pastilah perintah untuk musyawarah itu pada semua urusan
2706423 wahai orang orang yang beriman janganlah kalian mendahului allah dan rasul nya dan bertakwalah kalian kepada allah sesungguhnya allah maha mendengar dan maha mengetahui
2706424 maka abu bakar tidak memilih musyawarah jika beliau memiliki hukum dari rasulullah
2706425 seorang hakim pemimpin diperintahkan untuk bermusyawarah karena seorang penasehat akan mengingatkan dalil dalil yang dia lalaikan dan menunjuki dalil dalil yang tidak dia ingat bukan untuk bertaqlid kepada penasehat tersebut pada apa yang dia katakan karena sesungguhnya allah tidak menjadikan kedudukan yang demikian diikuti dalam segala hal itu bagi siapapun setelah nabi
2706426 dan para imam setelah nabi wafat bermusyawarah pada hal hal yang mubah dengan para ulama yang amanah untuk mengambil yang paling mudah
2706427 dan jika seorang pemimpin bermusyawarah dengan mereka ahli syura kemudian sebagian mereka menjelaskan kepadanya sesuatu yang wajib dia ikuti baik dari kitabullah atau sunnah rasul nya atau ijma kaum muslimin maka dia wajib mengikutinya dan tiada ketaatan kepada siapapun pada hal hal yang menyelisihinya adapun jika pada hal hal yang diperselisihkan kaum muslimin maka mestinya meminta pendapat dari masing masing mereka beserta alasannya lalu pendapat paling mirip dengan kitabullah dan sunnah rasul nya itulah yang ia amalkan
2706428 syura terjadi karena perbedaan pendapat maka seseorang yang bermusyawarah hendaknya melihat perbedaan tersebut kemudian melihat kepada pendapat yang paling dekat kepada al quran dan as sunnah jika ia mampu lalu jika allah membimbingnya kepada yang allah kehendaki maka hendaknya ia ber azam bertekad untuk kemudian melakukannya dengan bertawakkal kepada allah dimana inilah ujung dari ijtihad yang diminta dan dengan inilah allah perintahkan nabi nya dalam ayat ini ali imran 159
2706429 tidaklah allah mengutus seorang nabi dan tidaklah menjadikan seorang khalifah kecuali ia akan punya dua orang kepercayaan salah satunya memerintahkan kepada yang baik dan menganjurkannya dan yang lain memerintahkan kepada yang jelek dan menganjurkan kepadanya maka orang yang terlindungi adalah orang yang dilindungi oleh allah
2706430 bahwa abu bakr jika mendapati sebuah masalah maka beliau melihat kepada kitabullah jika beliau beliau mendapatkan sesuatu yang memutuskan perkara itu maka beliau putuskan dengannya dan jika beliau mengetahuinya dari sunnah nabi maka beliaupun memutuskan dengannya bila tidak beliau ketahui beliau keluar kepada kaum muslimin dan bertanya kepada mereka tentang sunnah nabi pada perkara yang tersebut dan bila hal itu tidak mampu menyelesaikan maka beliau panggil tokoh tokoh kaum muslimin dan para ulama mereka lalu beliau bermusyawarah dengan mereka

2706444 jika kamu berkata bahwa raja raja penguasa di masa ini tidak seperti raja raja lalu bahwa rakyat sekarang pun tidak seperti rakyat di masa lalu
2706445 dan demikialah kami jadikan sebagian orang orang yang dzalim itu menjadi teman bagi sebagiab yang lain disebabkan apa yang mereka usahakan
2706446 berbuat adil kalian wahai rakyat kalaian menginginkan kami untuk berjalan denga peri hidup abu bakar dan umar pada kalian tidak berbuat terhadap kami dan diri kalian

2706448 dan kalau kami tidak memperkuat hati mu niscaya kamu hampir hampir condong sedikit kepada mereka
2706449 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kalian menolong agama alloh niscaya dia akan menolong kalian dan meneguhkan kedudukan kedudukan kalian
2706450 allah meneguhkan iman orang orang yang beriman dengan ucapan yang teguh itu dalam kehidupan di dunia dan di akhirat q s ibrahim 27
2706451 dan perumpamaan orang orang yang menginfaqkan hartanya karena mencari keridloan allah dan untuk keteguhan jiwa mereka seperti sebuah kebun yang terletak di dataran tinggi yang disiram oleh hujan lebat maka kebun itu menghasilkan buahnya dua kali lipat jika hujan lebat tidak menyiraminya maka hujan gerimis pun memadai dan allah maha melihat apa yang kalian perbuat

2706454 ya rabb kami ampunilah dosa dosa kami dan tindakan tindakan kami dan tetapkanlah pendirian kami dan tolonglah kami terhadap kaum yang kafir
2706455 tidaklah kamu perhatikan bagaimana alloh telah membuat permisalan kalimat yang baik seperti pohon yang baik akarnya teguh dan cabangnya menjulang ke langit pohon itu memberikan buahnya pada setiap musim dengan seizin rabbnya alloh membuat permisalan permisalan itu untuk manusia supaya mereka selalu ingat
2706456 mereka hendak memadamkan cahaya agama allah dengan mulut ucapan ucapan mereka dan allah tetap menyempurnakan cahaya nya meskipun orang orang kafir benci

2706484 some countries like to use new sanctions but these political efforts and psychological propaganda will eventually be fruitless

2706498 it was really hard to shoot in the rain but there is nothing we can do about it because we cant change the weather
2706499 i felt a little nervous and a little disappointed but finishing fourth is always better than fifth

2706501 i was very nervous as its been very difficult for my people it was nice of natalia to come up to me afterwards and give me an embrace
2706502 despite good fundamentals we have been unable to insulate ourselves from sector developments indeed the second quarter was clearly weaker than the previous year the latter part of the year also seems difficult and the operational result for the second half of the year might dip into the red
2706503 high fuel prices and a trend towards lower ticket prices have been unsettling developments for airlines the overcapacity in the market has not allowed ticket prices to rise in parallel with costs the coming cost cutting programmes in the sector will be so severe that in countries where airlines collapse there may be demands for flight connections to be maintained for business needs using state funds
2706504 the situation in the sector may remain extremely difficult due to expensive fuel and uncertain development of demand in the second half of the year fuel costs are expected to account for around 28 per cent of finnairs turnover whereas last year the jet fuel bill accounted for a fifth of turnover
2706505 in punctuality we are again among the best of european airlines moreover the amount of baggage delays has also fallen to a third of last summers total

2706507 this erotic romance by ms da costa is one of the best i have ever had the pleasure to read and i am looking forward to reading many more by her
2706508 more pleasure than you could ever imagine ive become addicted
2706509 a pretty amusing if silly sex romp that will most likely fit the bill if you are looking for something naughty to read
2706510 with her usual strength of character sense of fun and powerfully passionate prose portia da costa shows us that even the lifeless hearts of the undead can still beat with the stirrings of romance
2706511 hotbed is a perfect showcase for portia da costas inestimable talent
2706512 suite seventeen contains all portias trademark treats from the arousing narrative a wicked blend of deviant episodes and an undercurrent of pragmatic and poignant romance
2706513 i would have stayed up all night long to finish reading this book i just cant get enough of portia da costa
2706514 continuum is an intelligent articulate foray into an erotic world lurking just beneath our civilised society

2706516 the imt international monitoring team on the ceasefire has been embarrassed and we are backing the local police in restoring normalcy in the area
2706517 the government is enforcing the law against these lawless elements
2706518 they refused to obey their officials therefore they should be ready for war
2706519 we do not like war but we have the mandate to enforce the rule of law the government has given them enough time

2706521 parang new year it was like new year this is the first time i heard extensive exchange of bullets and mortar fire
2706522 there was continuous shelling i hope it will not escalate to other areas
2706523 the use of big weapons hampered the movement of our troops back to maguindanao and our troops as normal reaction went on defensive position thus the continuous exchange of gun fire
2706524 our forces are moving out but still the army and the civilian militia were running after them so our troops fought back as it is happening now
2706525 this is a clear violation of the ceasefire they said they are going to pull out their troops in the area but it seems nothing happened
2706526 he promised too that they will try to convince once more commander kato i told him jaafar we will exhaust all to save the peace talks
2706527 violent video games have been a problem for a long time

2706531 it has slowly been growing as a target people are more and more interested in
2706532 there are a lot more people getting into it and really getting their hands dirty
2706533 ive been seeing a lot of reverse engineering on the apple platform
2706534 windows developers take their code and make it work on apple
2706535 they could take potential vulnerabilities with them or possibly create new ones because they are working on an entirely different platform
2706536 it shows people are getting proficient at analyzing apple software
2706537 there are people looking at the iphone we pass vulnerabilities on to vendors and when i communicate with apple the first thing they ask is if weve tested it on the iphone they dont want to be surprised

2706559 i was trying i didnt have it at the end
2706560 i felt fairly relaxed going into this one i felt in control of my nerves
2706561 it was a new race for me and something i really had to go into with a different mindset and really focus on my own race
2706562 i cant complain when you go your best time i gave it every ounce of energy i had
2706563 i came up a little short of gold today however its an honor to swim for a great nation and in front of the president
2706564 we are on offense on the most important domestic issue before the country which is the energy crisis
2706565 we have blunted obamas momentum both nationally and in the key states where were ahead even or just slightly behind in a horrific political year
2706566 the most underappreciated dynamic of the race is the intensity advantage
2706567 thats why george bush won in 2004 they had an intensity gap and we have it now
2706568 people are very mediocre predictors of their own behavior what they tell you in june and july will not necessarily comport well with what they do in november
2706569 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2706570 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2706571 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2706572 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2706573 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2706574 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2706575 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa

2706628 ik ben een ridder van de ronde tafel en mijn naam is sir persides en bij toeval kwam ik hierlangs en ik logeerde in het kasteel aan de voet van deze brug maar daar woont een onbeleefde dame en omdat ze aanbood mijn minnares te zijn en ik haar weigerde stuurde zij onverhoeds haar mannen op mij af eer ik ooit bij mijn wapen kon komen zo grepen ze mij en bonden mij en ik weet wel dat ik hier zal sterven tenzij een man van eer mijn ketenen verbreekt
2706629 omdat u net als ik een ridder van de ronde tafel bent vertrouw ik op god dat ik uw ketenen los zal maken
2706630 dat was een slag zo machtig als ik ooit voelde van een mensenhand en als die ketting er niet was geweest had u mij gedood
2706631 sir pas op want daar komt een ridder die met u van doen wil hebben
2706632 wat is dat voor een gewoonte voor een dame om goede ridders te vernietigen tenzij zij uw minnaar willen zijn pardie dat is een schandelijke gewoonte voor een dame en als ik geen belangrijker dingen te doen had zou ik een einde maken aan al uw kwalijke gebruiken
2706633 en zeg de koning hoe u mij ontmoette en zeg mijn broeder sir aglovale hoe ik u redde en vraag hem mij niet te zoeken want ik ben in een queeste om sir lancelot du lac te zoeken en als hij me mocht zoeken zal hij me niet vinden en zeg hem dat ik hem of het hof niet zal zien eer ik sir lancelot heb gevonden zeg ook tegen sir kay de hofmeester en sir mordred dat ik op jezus vertrouw ooit net zo waardig te zijn als ieder van hen beiden want hun grollen en hun schimpscheuten op de dag dat ik ridder werd gemaakt zal ik nooit vergeten en zeg ze dat ik dat hof niet zal zien voor men er meer roem van mij spreekt dan men ooit deed van n van hen beiden
2706634 op mijn woord hij zal een ridder worden zo edel als wie ook
2706635 mijn waarde heren sir percival groet u beiden beleefd en hij laat u zeggen dat hij op god vertrouwt dat hij van even grote waardigheid zal zijn als u beiden eer hij terugkeert aan het hof en dat meer lieden over zijn edele daden zullen spreken dan er ooit over de uwe spraken
2706636 maar toen hij ridder werd gemaakt leek het er niet bepaald op dat hij ooit een goede ridder zou worden
2706637 hij moet wel een goede ridder worden want zijn vader en zijn broeders waren allen edele ridders
2706638 beste ridder bedwing uw hand een ogenblik want we hebben al te lang gevochten om een onbeduidend geschil daarom vraag ik u mij uw naam te zeggen want niet eerder werd ik zo weerstaan
2706639 en ik kwam niet eerder een ridder tegen die mij zo deerlijk verwondde als gij hebt gedaan en toch heb ik in vele slagen gevochten en u moet weten dat ik een ridder van de ronde tafel ben en mijn naam is sir ector de maris broeder van de goede ridder sir lancelot du lac
2706640 en mijn naam is sir percival van galis die het zich tot queeste heeft gemaakt om sir lancelot te zoeken en nu weet ik zeker dat ik mijn queeste nimmer zal volbrengen want uw handen hebben mij gedood
2706641 want ik ben door uw hand gedood en ik zal het niet overleven daarom vraag ik u
2706642 om naar de priorij hier vlakbij te rijden en mij een priester te brengen opdat ik mijn verlosser mag ontvangen want ik zal niet leven en als u aan het hof van koning arthur komt vertel mijn broeder sir lancelot dan niet hoe u mij doodde want dan zal hij uw doodsvijand zijn maar u kunt zeggen dat ik werd gedood in mijn queeste terwijl ik hem zocht
2706643 u spreekt van dingen die nooit zullen gebeuren want ik ben zo zwak door het bloeden dat ik nauwelijks kan staan hoe zou ik dan mijn paard nemen
2706644 wat heeft dat te betekenen dat we zo geheeld zijn terwijl we zojuist nog op punt van sterven waren
2706645 het is een heilig vat dat door een maagd wordt gedragen en daarin is een deel van het bloed van onze heer jezus christus maar het is onzichtbaar
2706646 ik zag een jonkvrouw leek het mij geheel in het wit met een vat in haar beide handen en meteen was ik geheeld

2706653 the prime minister has also said that it should continue as in the past

2706664 i know that israel is very concerned and very aware of the support of christian organizations in israel and of christians around the world especially evangelicals towards israel and im sure that they really do not want to harm that friendship by causing unnecessary stress to organizations
2706665 sometimes unfortunately it takes a little bit of people calling it to their attention over a period of time before it actually gets change
2706666 so hopefully though they made this change theyll see that its going to cause really undue stress to these organizations

2706672 i was commenting in 1995 while talking with a co worker about vaporware screwing up the market and wanted to study it it seems from the above that someone else got paid to do just that it would also be good to have handy an itemized list with the items microsoft has promised enough to hobble competition but failed to deliver like winfs for example
2706673 best of all would be to be able to point to a government web site with the same content
2706674 defendants cannot argue almost a year later that plaintiff failed to plead fraud with particularity
2706675 the offense of monopoly under section 2 of the sherman act has two elements 1 the possession of monopoly power in the relevant market and 2 the willful acquisition or maintenance of that power as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product business gt acumen or historical accident
2706676 shall be final and there shall be no review of such decision by appeal or certiorari or otherwise
2706677 truly reflect the monopolists expectations about future quality or availability where that expectation is both actually held in good faith and objectively reasonable
2706678 a monopolist is not forbidden to publicize its product unless the extent of this activity is so unwarranted by competitive exigencies as to constitute an entry barrier
2706679 i t was never entirely clear to the court what memorex claimed was inaccurate about the announcement of ncp

2706682 preannounced windows signed up the major oems and showed a demo to freeze the market and prevent vision from getting any momentum it sure worked vision died visicorp died and dos kept on chugging
2706683 a far superior product to ms dos for the preceding nine months
2706684 o ne of the most important stimulants for adding features
2706685 microsoft outlines dos 5 0 to ward off dr dos
2706686 the feature enhancements of ms dos version 5 0 were decided
2706687 one of the most important stimulants for adding features was competitive pressure from dr dos 5 0 which we first learned of in the spring of 1990 the dr dos feature set led us to add umb support task swapping and undelete
2706688 as for the timing of the leaks it was not an orchestrated microsoft plan nor did the leaks come from microsoft
2706689 on the pr side we have begun an aggressive leak campaign for ms dos 5 0 the goal was to build an anticipation for ms dos 5 0 and diffuse potential excitement momentum from the dr dos 5 0 announcement
2706690 thus to serve our customers better we decided to be more forthcoming about version 5 0
2706691 diffuse potential excitement momentum from the dr dos 5 0 announcement
2706692 we are distributing to you a comparison between ms dos 5 0 and their version inform your customers as discussed keep them at bay
2706693 virtually all of our oems worldwide were informed about dos 5 which diffused dris ability to capitalize on a window of opportunity with these oems
2706694 at least until the feature set was completely defined for a new release like windows 95 any schedule is going to be largely meaningless
2706695 was not defined yet and we need to know what it is before we ship it
2706696 but realistically msdos6 is still quite a ways off i presume msdos wont be until mid to late 93
2706697 there was never a formal schedule and a launch plan and a marketing team and the whole nine yards for this thing
2706698 virtually all of our oems worldwide were informed about dos 5 which diffused dris ability to capitalize on a window of opportunity with these oems
2706699 once you lose a lot of ground it is very very hard to pick up
2706700 we cant just sit on the sidelines til ms dos 6 hoping fud and leaks will carry us
2706701 the next version of windows will not need dos to
2706702 legal actions when taken by a monopolist may give rise

2706713 i am and have been willing to take any test necessary to establish the fact that i am not the father of any baby and i am truly hopeful that a test will be done so this fact can be definitively established
2706714 this was our private matter and i frankly wanted it to be private because as painful as it was i did not want to have to play it out on a public stage as well
2706715 because of a recent string of hurtful and absurd lies in a tabloid publication because of a picture falsely suggesting that john was spending time with a child it wrongly alleged he had fathered outside our marriage our private matter could no longer be wholly private

2706724 kids just go wild over that they have to sign up for them up by 3 30 and they can sign up everyday but they must be present to win
2706725 other fairs have looked at that program we have seven different business or organizations that donated two bikes each we do that the drawing at the entertainment stage its just been a fun thing we started with one bike and then went to two

2706728 a fun thing i havent said much about is the beating of the skins show a percussion drum show these kids love to come in and show off their drums its not a contest its just fun they have 21 minutes to show off most do not want that long i think weve reduced the time to about 15 minutes

2706730 all our high school bands are performing again throughout the week thats great to have that kind of participation since school hasnt started yet

2706732 i put 21 caches out like a 21 gun salute

2706735 they heard about the situation with the water out there about the lawsuit and how wells in that and other areas around here have the sulfur from all of the old mines
2706736 theyve got a process where they think they can clean up the streams and they are interested in trying it in this area
2706737 we thought if you can get the chromium out why couldnt you use this process to grab other things out of water
2706738 its kind of geared more toward the larger companies the coal companies that could pre treat the water before it is released
2706739 the process still requires additional treatment of the water to be potable but it knocks the iron and sulfates out

2706746 were getting the word out about the elks and the american cancer society
2706747 zanesville needs more events like this going on in this area downtown at the park
2706748 we brought in local schools so it helps the local schools raise money too
2706749 i think whats happening is that since the so called oil bubble has burst some it takes a little bit of pressure off of natural gas
2706750 that doesnt sound like much but it translates to tens of thousands of dollars across the stores each month
2706751 the commodity portion of the gas bill shouldnt increase from where it is
2706752 we have as many items in the silent auction as well so many that it would be hard to calculate the total worth of tonights auction offerings
2706753 and the most critical of all our fundraising activities because it does bring a lot of special needs monies into the shelter it brings funds for mercy care and special equipment that we might not otherwise have for the shelter it is very important for the animals right now and it is good for the community to come out and see what we do we need more volunteers the animals just cant make it without us especially this year we find that the shelter and the pound are just overwhelmed because of the economy and various other reasons we need all the help we can get
2706754 right now we have a pretty full house with about 400 animals
2706755 now that the road construction is about done adoptions are coming around but it has been tough we always focus on the importance of spaying and neutering the battle against over population is ongoing and until people realize the importance of spaying and neutering we will continue our efforts to educate about it
2706756 a lot of excitement there are people who came in from out of the area just to bid on those baskets and help the shelter
2706757 its so much fun and it helps the animals everything we do helps the animals
2706758 its wonderful and everybody has such a good time its a good project
2706759 this is the greatest event of the year i support anything to do for animals they were my first love it is very dear to me they do a fantastic job
2706760 we have so many good people working for the shelter for the animals and it all goes back to the animals thats the important thing
2706761 the worlds of e learning and video are colliding and splash is creating technology solutions that make it easier for the learning community to embrace video
2706762 text books and physical classrooms are no longer enough for this next generation of learners google youtube and tivo have fundamentally changed the way we all like to self select while seeking knowledge and our entertainment and then retrieve it on demand we feel an enterprise level video training and delivery platform will allow companies to meet the needs of learners that are demanding high quality video based training
2706763 in the beginning i thought it was normal to have a male in the room 24 hours a day i thought it was normal to be chained up when i showered and used the toilet
2706764 i was in a lot of pain and i was bleeding heavily they refused to take the cuff off even for a minute
2706765 once when i was in the shower there was a knot in the chain making it even shorter the shower wasnt working properly i was bleeding heavily but couldnt reach the water
2706766 id be talking to the doctors about the details of my condition in front of these strangers it was really personal stuff and it made me feel so uncomfortable but i still had to be chained to one of the guards
2706767 i never wanted to be treated differently to anyone else but i felt they were too harsh this was my first offence im not a persistent offender and they treated me like my crime had been far far worse
2706768 wonderful excellent service and i will definitely use your website again thanks

2706806 n o tivemos uma competi o justa lutei um pouco contra os rbitros sa com vontade de rir pensei que estava a lutar contra quatro pessoas mas nem quero dar isso como desculpa quando estamos num dia para ganhar entramos e projectamos a outra pessoa por ippon se for preciso mesmo que os rbitros n o estejam a ajudar
2706807 senti que estava na minha melhor forma de sempre n o desculpa mas houve momentos de arbitragem que foram fundamentais senti que era a nica que queria projectar e que as outras s queriam esperar que eu avan asse com ataque para contra atacar e aproveitar foi isso que aconteceu
2706808 h coisas que para mim n o estiveram bem mas a verdade que elas me projectaram e souberam jogar com a arbitragem se calhar o erro meu que quero projectar infelizmente parece que um erro querer ganhar mas um erro que vou ter sempre

2706818 bae may provide as many as 70 extra combat aircraft to the saudis although some defence industry executives say the contract is likely to be for 48
2706819 it is understood that senior staff from the ministry of defence department recently visited saudi arabia to discuss the deal
2706820 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2706821 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2706822 hes trying to in some ways to navigate this delicate point which is that of course it seems that he betrayed a woman who herself was terribly terribly sick

2706825 were really very very disappointed because we had the match under control
2706826 we can be very dangerous but we have to find the right balance between attack and defence
2706827 we still have a lot of preparation to do as a team
2706828 i think theres a lot of quality what weve got to do is iron out a lot of mistakes were making we deserved better this evening

2706833 the operators of seaview farm will then monitor the site daily and carry out proactive treatments to ensure that the problem does not reoccur
2706834 the attacks are occurring in regions of georgia far from the zone of conflict in south ossetia they mark a dangerous escalation in the crisis
2706835 this is about annihilation of a democracy on their borders
2706836 we on our own cannot fight with russia we want immediate ceasefire immediate cessation of hostilities separation of russia and georgia and international mediation
2706837 a ceasefire would not be a solution the fighting is still going on the georgian forces are continuing to be on the south ossetian territory
2706838 the actions of the georgian powers in south ossetia are of course a crime first of all against their own people
2706839 the territorial integrity of georgia has suffered a fatal blow
2706840 we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings and a return by the parties to the status quo
2706841 our units are well equipped with anti tank rockets and they thwarted a russian tank attack
2706842 whatever side is used to bomb civilians and the positions of peacekeepers this side is not safe and they should know this
2706843 the very most twisted stories in all the greek myth
2706844 spivey throws a very modern voice into writing the ancient myth
2706845 originated from the desire to create a single organic narrative of as much greek mythology as most people want or need to know
2706846 most of the stories were changed and grew more fantastical through each oral retelling
2706847 many of the stories had very unexciting or unappealing endings so ingenious touches of human invention were freely dropped in enliven familiar stories
2706848 where spiveys book works least well is in the attempt give the book a cyclical ending effect
2706849 i told him embrace the olympics dont let the olympics embrace you
2706850 that means go and experience it go and find out for yourself
2706851 hes having a ball and hes not overawed at all you cant get him out of the games room because there are so many choices hes on the wii and theres certainly some noise coming out of the tv room
2706852 the beauty of tom is that he is so focused on his diving hes here to learn hes here to get experience but were fully aware that if he and blake dive really well they are in with a chance theres no question about that
2706853 if one of them makes a mistake it could be game over
2706854 the thing that makes tom and the great ones so great is that they just seem to be born with it
2706855 when he was in junior teams he became homesick he missed his parents and he would cry at night
2706856 he was a bit of a mess at the time in the junior teams there was a 9 30 curfew at night but when
2706857 hes enjoying being treated like an adult at the end of the day he knows what hes got to do is to dive well but if that means staying up late playing games thats fine
2706858 its better than being forced to go to bed at 9 30 and not being able to sleep for four hours
2706859 tom was in the green room with kobe bryant and lebron james and tom looked the size of a basketball next to them

2706873 thats why they have paid 19m for robbie and are ready to buy again with gareth barry
2706874 they are both very good players and you need these sort of players to win crunch games that is why they are going for big money
2706875 we made some poor mistakes and i have to say that on the night they were better than us
2706876 we didnt shoot to our potential it was not one of those matches which we could not have won things simply didnt go the way we would have liked and the pressure of performing in olympics got the better of some of our archers
2706877 however we still have all our archers in with a chance in individual competition
2706878 i had a good feeling throughout i led in the first half and i kept a check on wind and saw where it went but in the second half there was much more wind and it was also not continuous and that made things difficult
2706879 islam on campus a survey of uk student opinion gives us a hint
2706880 that 32 percent of muslim students said killing in the name of religion could be justified while 60 of active members of on campus islamic societies said the same only 2 of non muslims polled felt this way
2706881 forty percent of muslim students polled supported the introduction of sharia islamic law into british law for muslims and a third supported the introduction of a worldwide caliphate based on sharia law
2706882 that most muslim students supported secularism and democratic values were generally tolerant of other minorities and rejected violence in the name of their faith
2706883 like their arab predecessors the ottomans were energetic empire builders in the name of jihad by the early 16th century they had conquered syria and egypt from the mamluks the formidable slave soldiers who had contained the mongols and destroyed the crusader kingdoms under sultan suleiman the magnificent they soon turned northward by the middle of the 17th century they seemed poised to overrun christian europe only to be turned back in fierce fighting at the gates of vienna in 1683 the ottomans defeat by the victorious european powers of world war i to say nothing of the work of mustafa kemal atat rk the father of modern turkish nationalism finally brought an end both to the ottoman caliphate itself and to islams centuries long imperial reach
2706884 although arabs are naturally attached to their native land their nationalism is not confined by boundaries it is an aspiration to restore the great tolerant civilization of the early caliphate
2706885 like the leaders of al qaeda many muslims and arabs unabashedly pine for the reconquest of spain and consider their 1492 expulsion from the country a grave historical injustice waiting to be undone indeed as immigration and higher rates of childbirth have greatly increased the number of muslims within europe itself over the past several decades countries that were never ruled by the caliphate have become targets of muslim imperial ambition since the late 1980s islamists have looked upon the growing population of french muslims as proof that france too has become a part of the house of islam in britain even the more moderate elements of the muslim community are candid in setting out their aims
2706886 the fuel of islamic imperialism remains as volatile as ever and is very far from having burned itself out to deny its force is the height of folly and to imagine that it can be appeased or deflected is to play into its hands only when it is defeated and when the faith of islam is no longer a tool of islamic political ambition will the inhabitants of muslim lands and the rest of the world be able to look forward to a future less burdened by jihadists and their gory dreams

2706967 it would be pink on the outside pink carpets pink furniture pink jammies the men on her staff would be cool with be shirtless chippendale types with names like leon
2706968 instead of a bowling alley in the basement of the white house paris would have a pilates studio and oh yeah shed have foam parties in the oval office for the white house staff and old girlfriends from boarding school
2706969 she would answer all questions while walking and posing for a wall of photographers and theyd be yelling out paris look here

2706974 witnesses some only 12 at the time testified to being raped by french troops from operation turquoise in the refugee camp set up for tutsi survivors at cyangugu belgian and german witnesses spoke of the training given to the interahamwe and the financing of the interim government by paris

2706983 anwar was cleared of all the sodomy charges before so what are they trying to prove now we have all grown up in the last 10 years and people are not so stupid to just accept all these things blindly
2706984 it looks like the government is out to fix him again everyone knows that the charge against him is nothing but a lie
2706985 the only thing we can do now is to vote for anwar and make sure he gets to parliament and eventually form the government only then can we right all that is wrong in this country
2706986 im sorry to say it but now the dictatorships of the 60s and 70s are being replaced by some groups that take airports occupy electoral offices and take shots at ministers cars

2707091 flushing occurs because the vasomotor system the part of the brain that controls temperature in the body dilates your vessels veins and arteries to give the blood a bigger surface area and therefore cool it down
2707092 its called vasodilation and thats why you go red theres a bigger blood flow around the body
2707093 you flush if youre embarrassed because neurotransmitters in your brain signal this emotion and that causes the central nervous system to produce chemicals which make the vessels dilate
2707094 the hormone oestrogen regulates the hypothalamus which is the heat stabilisation centre in the brain so when your oestrogen is low it can cause hot flushes
2707095 theres some evidence that the herb black cohosh is very effective at treating hormonal flushing because it mimics oestrogen
2707096 theres also anecdotal evidence that sepia tablets a homeopathic remedy can help flushes i have had many patients who found that it helped
2707097 i see four or five patients a week with rosacea

2707117 the withdrawal has been spotted by the peacekeeping forces intelligence the georgian side has indeed started removing its units
2707118 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people

2707130 cotidianul cancan nu si asuma responsabilitatea juridica pentru parerile exprimate in rubrica
2707131 cheated on more times than a blind woman playing scrabble with gypsies
2707132 a lot of people are disappointed that we elected a democratic congress in 2006 to end the war and nothing happened
2707133 but as voters engage they will see this campaign through the presidential race prism and thats something reichert doesnt want i view this race as a toss up
2707134 reicherts big problem isnt himself its president bush this could come down to the wire just like last time
2707135 when it comes to life and death issues politics is not a factor
2707136 he talks kind of moderate even i could vote for him
2707137 but what he actually does is something else he votes far left
2707138 i dont believe in no win wars that are just police actions
2707139 its like magical thinking with no one bothering to scratch the surface
2707140 full on pander mode flailing around looking for anything that has traction in polls
2707141 saying that we can drill our way out of it this idea that every little bit helps is denying reality
2707142 it may not be good politics but its not fair to the electorate to let them think that a few little tweaks are going to fix the problem
2707143 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
2707144 state capitalism with direct intervention in a large sector of the economy
2707145 if wall street sees 4 8 plants built with important federal support over the next seven years on cost and on schedule i think youre going to see robust support from the financial sector
2707146 thats just not a feasible or responsible thing to say
2707147 if were going to cut down on greenhouse gases we have to find a way to sequester them and emissions in general
2707148 i have been an oil man my whole life but this is one emergency we cannot drill our way out of
2707149 on this issue i think that americans are ahead of the candidates of both parties
2707150 our energy economy is undergoing a transformation and were just in the early stages
2707151 barr conceivably could be to john mccain what ralph nader was to al gore in 2000 ruinous
2707152 you have in ralph naders candidacy a genuine arab american who has a lot of notoriety and publicity it would be detrimental to obamas candidacy
2707153 obama cannot take the peace vote for granted there are peace candidates running from across the political spectrum
2707154 on the right are bob barr and chuck baldwin on the left are cynthia mckinney and ralph nader he needs to earn the vote of americans opposed to further war
2707155 well as someone with a liberal bias dunsmore would say that wouldnt he
2707156 i have just become the symbol of the possibility of america returning to its best traditions
2707157 it has become increasingly clear in my travel that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2707158 the one constant in republican victories in fall elections has been large margins in springfield and those surrounding counties
2707159 if you dont campaign hard in a region of the state that is growing that represents a lot of votes
2707160 a good performing republican will get 65 percent of the vote in greene and surrounding counties
2707161 this race will be fought and won in the margins
2707162 if youre a democrat and cant get north of 40 percent in greene county youre in trouble
2707163 a lot of things hes said have really turned off and angered a lot of people including greene county democrats
2707164 the threat of obama is enough to get the hard core conservatives out
2707165 some places were unprepared some places just couldnt handle it
2707166 people know its going to be a historically high turnout whether they can do anything about it is another question
2707167 tens and sometimes hundreds of thousands of voters are disenfranchised sometimes raising serious questions about whether the intended choice of the voters was certified as the winner
2707168 the first couple of primaries get all the attention its decided and nobody turns out for other elections later on in the primary season
2707169 and that didnt happen this time and i think thats where some elections administrators in later primaries got caught
2707170 some might get lost or replaced or the person didnt fill out all the information and theyre not on the rolls
2707171 i want energy to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2707172 ive been going there as an individual businessman for 40 years to washington
2707173 the richer i got the more polite they were did i get anything done hell no
2707174 i want to get to a million people by the time congress comes back in after recess
2707175 if they see with me a million people that are gonna write to them say something to them put pressure on them theyre going to listen to us i can promise you that
2707176 i dont have any profit motive in this im doing it for america
2707177 it will be similar to the eisenhower interstate highway period in the 1950s
2707178 he said it was an emergency i want it to be declared an emergency i want them to give us corridors to move the power out of the central united states to the east and west coasts
2707179 and weve had a pretty good drop in the oil price
2707180 he believes in global warming i do too but global warming is on page 2 for me on page 1 its the 700 million going out the back door from our dependency on 70 percent of imported oil
2707181 and its also driving the key challenge for us which is energy independence
2707182 ive been working on this since i was elected in 1996 so i get excited whenever anybody else joins this effort
2707183 hes saying if you are not going to listen because im wealthy im going to shame you into listening to people its a great approach
2707184 he wasnt successful but he made a lot of money at it
2707185 eliminates peoples jobs and then asks the taxpayers to fund his new venture
2707186 american people are desperate for answers and if they get robbed in the process
2707187 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
2707188 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
2707189 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
2707190 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
2707191 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
2707192 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
2707193 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2707194 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
2707195 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
2707196 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
2707197 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
2707198 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
2707199 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
2707200 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
2707201 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
2707202 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
2707203 i dont know how much we raised here but its probably something that starts with a four
2707204 this is one of the best events weve seen in a while
2707205 and thats where the big money really is there are these wealthy people here who put on these lavish fundraisers and they bring in wealthy people from boston or new york it turns into a lot of money
2707206 to win the presidency you have to make sure you have the money and the resources to go out there and tell the truth this area is a great resource to have
2707207 i had to donate the maximum this time this election is too important i needed to put my money where my ideals were
2707208 obviously a lot of money comes out of those things
2707209 youve got a lot of high powered people in one room thats not necessarily representative of the island as a whole weve got a very strong republican network here
2707210 this election simply wont work if people dont participate and money is one important way to participate
2707211 the cake went all over me that was the end of my suit
2707212 i always wondered whether sometime a political protester would hit me with a pie in the face i never thought a friendly birthday cake would attack me from the rear
2707213 id like to hear the governor and legislative leaders tell the voters where the shortfall is coming from and unless i hear that im not sure we ought to take a gamble
2707214 education funding is very important part of our economy has to be based on attracting and keeping good paying jobs and we cant do that without a well educated work force
2707215 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
2707216 the jonah factor 13 spiritual steps to finding the job of a lifetime
2707217 senator lieberman supports both democrats and republicans and he gave to the committee as a senior member of the caucus

2707221 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
2707222 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
2707223 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
2707224 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
2707225 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
2707226 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
2707227 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
2707228 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
2707229 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
2707230 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
2707231 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
2707232 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
2707233 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
2707234 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
2707235 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
2707236 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
2707237 clearly we shouldnt relax our guard just because we are automating the elections
2707238 this is the electronic equivalent of ballot boxes stuffed with ballots even before the voting has started
2707239 even though 27 votes each were recorded for their running mates
2707240 whether it paid bribes to win a venezuela election contract in 2004
2707241 the current way computers are used to record count and tabulate votes threatens the basic democratic principles of voting in secret and counting in public in dre you are already counting in secret
2707242 more than a technological problem election fraud is really a social problem and therefore calls for social solutions supported by technological means the only effective social solution to fraud is elections is eternal vigilance and punishment for the cheats
2707243 the lives of people especially the youth who will sign up on the red list will definitely be in the red meaning stepping into the danger zone
2707244 after others learn about this new group kaya natin we can hardworking and ethical local government officials will come out hopefully
2707245 want to continue flying in your private jet and air conditioning your 16 000 square foot mansion and not worry about hurting the environment then send us your money and well offset the damage youre doing by planting trees
2707246 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
2707247 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2707248 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2707249 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2707250 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2707251 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2707252 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
2707253 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
2707254 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
2707255 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
2707256 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
2707257 he was absolutely marvellous so prepared so professional so enthusiastic
2707258 i didnt know jean lemire but the fact that it was a canadian piece swung me over to it
2707259 i looked at it and i really loved their work
2707260 they went through trauma and personal anguish and terrible terrible disappointment with what is happening with the world
2707261 oh i hope they get a devastating understanding of what terrible things that we are doing
2707262 just look at the wretched broadcasting in the united states during this presidential campaign its disgusting look what theyre feeding people
2707263 if barack obama is elected president then al gore will be the energy czar in the united states and that i do believe would have a very positive effect
2707264 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
2707265 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
2707266 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
2707267 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
2707268 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
2707269 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2707270 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
2707271 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
2707272 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2707273 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
2707274 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2707275 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
2707276 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
2707277 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
2707278 we have to free ourselves from the domination of the big oil companies that have the ability to manipulate the price
2707279 sitting next to someone on a senate committee has sparked more than a few deep friendships
2707280 obviously my name was linked to it but other than that theres nothing that can be said
2707281 he was a governor who tried to not ruffle feathers
2707282 as a debater i felt like i was in the twilight zone show you want to reach over and slit the arm to see if theres flesh and blood or just wires
2707283 one of my big accomplishments was at one point in the debate he started to sweat
2707284 is it boring to win five times as a democrat in a state thats overwhelmingly republican
2707285 obviously the people of indiana think theres something exciting about him
2707286 real results by the end of my first term in office
2707287 take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
2707288 leverage billions more in private capital to build a new energy economy
2707289 everybody says they want to support it but its been a tough sell
2707290 a number of utilities have reported that only 20 percent to 30 percent of their customers are aware that a green power option is offered
2707291 thats confusing they think its the wind why isnt it free
2707292 what we see in georgia is whats the minimum that we can do well take your money and well green wash and do a lot of propaganda about the program
2707293 10 years behind the curve southern co is looking at offshore wind but theyre not really advancing the ball on renewable energy in a credible or serious way
2707294 as much as 1 billion on renewable generation over the next 10 years
2707295 if they had something in place where they were doing wind turbines on the coast or solar modules or solar plants or something like that i would be more inclined to pay more for that
2707296 but its just really hard for me to justify paying more for landfill methane gas
2707297 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
2707298 if a person is too safe and conservative hes not likely to come up with great ideas
2707299 pick your failure apart as if you were a commentator at a golf tournament
2707300 being fired teaches you that your workplace doesnt define you as much as you thought it did
2707301 dont be too blas too self blaming or too defensive
2707302 my expectations about my previous job were off and i also lacked some of the resources i needed
2707303 we tend to overreact to failures and ignore the successful aspects of these experiences
2707304 when he wasnt writing dirty jokes and yelling at people on the radio he found time to avoid paying his taxes in 18 different states
2707305 im not proud of every joke ive ever told but i know theres a difference between what you say as a comedian and what you do as a u s senator
2707306 the two candidates are polar opposites on many major issues notably the wars in iraq and afghanistan and drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge coleman has been with bush on both and franken is energetically against both
2707307 if black people kill black people every day why not have a week and kill white people
2707308 are you better off now than you were four years ago
2707309 the only issue that hit home is the war because of him
2707310 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
2707311 axelrods not the type to drop a refrigerator on a guys head hell take the refrigerator apart drop one piece at a time and save the biggest piece for last
2707312 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
2707313 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
2707314 this is a classic washington story anonymous quotes from armchair quarterbacks with no sense of our strategy data or plan
2707315 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
2707316 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
2707317 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
2707318 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
2707319 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
2707320 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
2707321 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
2707322 yuck im only a half a mile into the run and its so smoggy i cant even see the spectators on the side of the road stop doing this
2707323 it is our job to clarify any confusion and misunderstanding
2707324 whatever decisions orders and policies handed down by the courts and the legal department we have to abide by them they should understand the countrys legal system
2707325 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2707326 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2707327 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
2707328 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
2707329 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2707330 do you think running a campaign ad in which you feature britney spears and paris hilton with barack obama is respectful
2707331 its a bit of humor its a way to draw people into the ad
2707332 were not deciding whos our favorite celebrity who we are fans of
2707333 the only strategy theyve got in this election is to try to scare you about me
2707334 well you know hes got a funny name and he doesnt look like all the presidents on the dollar bills and the five dollar bills
2707335 what obama was saying is theyre trying to scare you
2707336 theyre trying to scare the american people and believe me im an expert on how they do that
2707337 to insinuate that his celebrity is somehow all he has
2707338 theyre trying to say to america somehow hes not like you
2707339 the mccain campaign is to use barack obamas words raising the question is he a risky guy but it has nothing to do with his name or his skin color it has to do with his lack of experience and bad judgment his unreadiness to be president
2707340 in 2000 al gore gave me the extraordinary honor of being the first jewish american to run for national office and al gore said he had confidence in the american people that they would judge me based on my record not on my religion
2707341 and i urge barack obama to have the same faith in the american people that they will judge him on his record or lack of record certainly not on his name or his race
2707342 break americas gridlock by honoring a bipartisan effort if that is the only way to move us towards alternative and renewable fuels
2707343 when john mccain brings american troops home from iraq theyre staying home
2707344 i think liebermans going to want to be part of the stronger democratic majority
2707345 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2707346 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
2707347 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
2707348 from their own website yes the owl is scamming you but yes you lefty libs are so desperate to believe in ghosts and goblins that you will look the other way when the obvious smacks you upside the head
2707349 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
2707350 which many historians believe would have collapsed of its own weight no matter who was commander in chief
2707351 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
2707352 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
2707353 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
2707354 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
2707355 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
2707356 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
2707357 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
2707358 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
2707359 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
2707360 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
2707361 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
2707362 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
2707363 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
2707364 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
2707365 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
2707366 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
2707367 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
2707368 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
2707369 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
2707370 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
2707371 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
2707372 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
2707373 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
2707374 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
2707375 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads
2707376 how can people seriously think they are going to have a positive impact on energy prices in the medium term or the long term if they are not really doing anything about either supply or demand
2707377 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
2707378 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
2707379 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
2707380 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
2707381 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
2707382 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
2707383 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
2707384 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
2707385 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
2707386 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
2707387 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
2707388 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
2707389 inside the caucus according to a witness obama told the house members this is the moment
2707390 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
2707391 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
2707392 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
2707393 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
2707394 ordered up a teleconference with the current presidents treasury secretary granted an audience to the pakistani prime minister then he went up to capitol hill to be adored by house democrats in a presidential style pep rally
2707395 along the way he traveled in a bubble more insulating than the actual presidents traffic was shut down for him as he zoomed about town in a long presidential style motorcade while the public and most of the press were kept in the dark about his activities
2707396 capitol police cleared the halls just as they do for the actual president the secret service hustled him in through a side door just as they do for the actual president
2707397 house democrats had called the session to allow the left wing to vent its collective spleen
2707398 in the capitol basement yesterday long suffering house democrats took a trip to the land of make believe
2707399 they pretended a small conference room was the judiciary committee hearing room draping white linens over folding tables to make them look like witness tables and bringing in cardboard name tags and extra flags to make the whole thing look official
2707400 banged a large wooden gavel and got the other lawmakers to call him mr
2707401 i looked around the country for other sites like that i found a little place in upstate new york called love canal had the first hearing on that issue and toone tennessee that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2707402 we passed a major national law to clean up hazardous dump sites and we had new efforts to stop the practices that ended up poisoning water around the country weve still got work to do but we made a huge difference and it all happened because one high school student got involved
2707403 that was the one that you didnt hear of but that was the one that started it all
2707404 gore boasted about his efforts in congress 20 years ago to publicize the dangers of toxic waste
2707405 gore said his efforts made a lasting impact i was the one that started it all he said
2707406 al gore is simply unbelievable in the most literal sense of that term
2707407 its a pattern of phoniness and it would be funny if it werent also a little scary
2707408 heres the guy who said he was the character ryan oneal was based on in love story it seems to me hes now the guy who created the love canal case i mean isnt this getting ridiculous isnt it getting to be delusionary
2707409 add love canal to the list of verbal missteps by vice president gore
2707410 the man who mistakenly claimed to have inspired the movie love story and to have invented the internet says he didnt quite mean to say he discovered a toxic waste site
2707411 it reminds me of snoopy thinking hes the red baron
2707412 i mean how did he get this idea now youve seen al gore in action i know you didnt know that he was the prototype for ryan oneals character in love story or that he invented the internet he now is the guy who discovered love canal
2707413 what is it the zelig guy who keeps saying i was the main character in love story i invented the internet i invented love canal
2707414 again hes been caught red handed and again he has been left sputtering and apologizing this time he falsely took credit for breaking the love canal story yep another al gore bold faced lie
2707415 says he was the model for love story created the internet and this time he sort of discovered love canal
2707416 never mind that he didnt invent the internet serve as the model for love story or blow the whistle on love canal all of this would be funny if it werent so disturbing
2707417 the real question is how to react to mr gores increasingly bizarre utterings
2707418 websters new world dictionary defines delusional thusly the apparent perception in a nervous or mental disorder of some thing external that is actually not present a belief in something that is contrary to fact or reality resulting from deception misconception or a mental disorder
2707419 the part that bugs me is the way they nit pick
2707420 in fact gore said that was the one that started it all referring to the congressional hearings on the subject that he called
2707421 they fixed how they misquoted him but they didnt tell the whole story
2707422 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
2707423 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high
2707424 when theres so much in dispute you cant validly make strong conclusions
2707425 by raze you know zeebc i sense a certain progress on ambroses part
2707426 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
2707427 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
2707428 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
2707429 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
2707430 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
2707431 our penal code and criminal procedure code originate from the common law
2707432 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any power on earth to criticise another countrys internal administration of justice
2707433 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
2707434 weve had enough of this criticism but if they have a substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
2707435 we have been summoning people too often lately i think for now we just let this go
2707436 as the minister of foreign affairs i would like to send this message loud and clear stop meddling in our internal affairs
2707437 we can say the same thing about guantanamo we can say about the malaysians being detained there but we did not do that as we have respect for the systems of the world
2707438 what more with the creation of the asean charter we want to ensure a much brighter future for asean whether in the political economic security or socio cultural sphere
2707439 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2707440 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night
2707441 we get blamed by people for being neanderthals but just because something is new doesnt mean its a good idea to include it in the debates
2707442 this has been something weve explored in the past and for a variety of reasons logistical and scale it couldnt come together
2707443 we offered our functionality with the notion that we knew the goal of these debates is all about information and education
2707444 its a way for americans to educate themselves in a different manner and ideally make a more informed choice when choosing their leader
2707445 i think it will change the process for elections to come
2707446 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
2707447 channel 4 will not be in a hurry to commission him poor old durkin again
2707448 it is entirely appropriate that people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
2707449 we have regular exchanges with malaysian diplomats in washington on a number of subjects including with the malaysian charge daffaires yesterday
2707450 anwar ibrahims case was one of the topics of conversation
2707451 we take note of the many serious questions raised within malaysia including by the malaysian bar council concerning this case
2707452 for the second time gore is goring us repeating the 1998 goring
2707453 we hope he will stop goring as it is about time he re examines the goring process within himself and his country
2707454 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
2707455 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law
2707456 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
2707457 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
2707458 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
2707459 they have employed strategic bombers the most potent air weaponry that is in the russian arsenal they actually launched ballistic missile attacks on georgian territory
2707460 marks a severe escalation and is being conducted in areas far far from the south ossetia zone of conflict which is where the russian side has said it needed to protect its citizens and peacekeepers so the response has been far disproportionate to whatever threat russia had been citing
2707461 the georgians have offered a cease fire the response by the russians has been to step up the attacks continue bombing civilians with strategic air assets and then to reject the notion of any international mediation at all its very difficult for us to understand that
2707462 it is simply not acceptable that anyone would reject an offer of a cease fire and a plea for international mediation
2707463 those are some pretty powerful words that are really not helping us to end the violence and bring together a new process that can resolve the conflict
2707464 the line were hearing right now from russia is quite tough
2707465 the violence is endangering regional peace civilian lives have been lost and others are endangered we have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand down by all troops we call for an end to the russian bombings
2707466 should talk to the american people and talk to the world
2707467 i would be very direct with president putin that these actions will have consequences long term in terms of our relationship with russia and it is in violation of the norms of international conduct
2707468 a genuinely neutral mediator not the russian government must begin a process of negotiations immediately
2707469 keep georgia kind of weak and off balance and to make it hard for georgia to join nato
2707470 this is a very localized conflict there is not a danger of a regional conflict at all in our minds
2707471 por eso hemos elegido la comunicaci n y la concientizaci n como herramientas principales en nuestra lucha contra el descuido y la apat a
2707472 estos ejemplos concretos tienen m s impacto que unas cuantas campa as del gobierno que van y vienen pero que no se registran al nivel local

2707485 he encourages the two parties to continue to move ahead with implementation of the remaining road map provisions so that those displaced by mays fighting can soon return in safety and dignity to resume their lives in a secure environment
2707486 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds improvised explosive devices and authorising their emplacement across the province
2707487 he was also ultimately responsible for the july 13 suicide bomber attack in the deh rawood bazaar that killed 21 afghans and injured a further 12
2707488 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province

2707497 there is one other thing that i have always wanted i would like to be able to understand women what makes them laugh and cry why are they temperamental why are they so difficult sometimes basically what makes them tick

2707653 le rapport cop est mort la commission lest quasiment aussi on lui donne une derni re chance jusqu mercredi prochain mais cest purement formel
2707654 la sp culation cest l cume de la vague limportant cest la vague
2707655 la hausse des mati res premi res provient l vidence dune tension r currente entre la demande et les capacit s de production la sp culation ne fait quamplifier et pr cipiter le mouvement de hausse
2707656 les forces sp culatives amplifient les hausses de prix des mati res premi res
2707657 n anmoins ajoute cet expert il est impossible d valuer la part du prix qui revient la sp culation

2707660 il y a autant de r ponses que de m thodes utilis es pour lestimer grosso modo nos tudes montrent quun quart du prix ne peut sexpliquer par l quilibre actuel entre loffre et la demande mais ce chiffre est prendre avec beaucoup de pr caution
2707661 le march p trolier est d connect des donn es fondamentales doffre et de demande
2707662 pour des raisons structurelles doffre et de demande la hausse des prix des produits agricoles et des m taux devrait continuer dans les douze prochains mois mais avec des diff rences tr s fortes selon le type de mati res premi res concern dans ces mouvements il peut y avoir des exag rations en raison de la sp culation mais elles ne durent pas sur le long terme
2707663 je suspecte certains acteurs d mettre des rumeurs pour influencer les march s
2707664 le fait quautant de responsables politiques aient r pondu lappel d montre limportance que la communaut internationale attache d sormais aux questions alimentaires et agricoles

2707740 ce dont nous avons besoin aujourdhui le plus cest de courage politique et dun langage de v rit et le pr sident sarkozy ne manque ni de lun ni de lautre

a tool for channelling practical developmental and humanitarian support as well as for coordinating responses in international crisis situations as recent developments in the middle east iraq lebanon sudan and somalia have shown a coordinated and effective response from the international community during a crisis as well as before and after its most acute phase is of the utmost importance a

of problems of concern to both of our organizations during the political crisis in lebanon the secretary general strongly supported the league of arab states initiative and proposal to find a solution

competition at the field level and at headquarters in this respect enhancing the quality of cooperation is as important as expanding the areas of collaboration and i hope that the exchanges over the coming days will generate further proposals and ideas on how to reinvigorate and energize our collaboration along these lines together we can identify areas for qualitative improvements for the benefit of our two organizations and the people whom we serve i wish you success in your meeting

2707866 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2707867 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2707868 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2707869 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2707870 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2707871 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2707872 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2707873 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2707887 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2707888 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2707889 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2707890 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2707891 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2707892 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2707893 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2707894 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2707895 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2707896 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2707897 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2707898 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2707899 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

2707920 weve decided to do a five part mini series one big story that will run during one week
2707921 i wanted to make a really big noise about the show
2707922 torchwood really represents the essence of the channel its sexy action packed and a little bit subversive
2707923 so rumor has it that the bbc was unhappy and russell had to rush to write her out of series 3
2707924 personally id be very happy if they didnt add any more principle characters between jack ianto and gwen there are plenty of possible stories to tell for a season thats only having a five episode run

2707929 so every time im working on it im really really happy
2707930 i always describe it as in season 1 we were learning how to walk and in season 2 were running
2707931 he is a lot more comfortable with his immortality you learn about how the team around him became a part of torchwood and you also learn about his feelings and relationships with each of them which i think is really important
2707932 fans had heard he was going to watch former doctor who star catherine so they turned up in force complete with props
2707933 he was very charming and friendly with them during the interval but he was rightly disgusted when they disrupted her performance by singing the shows music and waving their sonic screwdrivers
2707934 catherine is a pro so she ignored them but david knew the only way to stop them was by getting up and leaving
2707935 i am proud to say that i am a g double e k
2707936 i just learned how to speak like american kids because they made fun of my scottish accent and i didnt want to be bullied when im back in the u k with scottish people i actually go back to my scottish accent

2707947 sometimes we have to live for quite a while with a question before finding the answer
2707948 isnt everyone sick of hearing the same ol crap about britney so why do you guys keep talking shat about her shouldnt we just leave her alone paparazzi included and not hear one more word about her
2707949 oh cause i want the money and im not supposed to take advantage of my boyfriend so you know i thought the only way to go was this way p s i hate coles

2707955 weve been able to increase our business with the consolidating entities
2707956 when you have products and services in the marketplace that are of great value they do survive mergers and acquisitions
2707957 we also like trizetto because in the health plan marketplace for information systems they are one of the dominant players
2707958 well positioned for changes that happen within the health plan marketplace
2707959 in short it is not classification based on quality that is illegal
2707960 nor is it publication of information regarding health care quality that is illegal it is undertaking these efforts in an opaque manner that tends to lead to legal backlash

2707981 it was very exciting sitting there this morning watching michael phelps set a world record was special to me because it made me realize how many people are inspired by him
2707982 now im in the position to have that opportunity to go out there and get a medal for my country today was hopefully the first step towards that
2707983 its about as humid as ive ever played in and i live in florida
2707984 its going to be a grind by the end of the week whoever is left standing is going to have to be someone thats in great shape physically

2707990 i knew it was going to be a tough race all the way through
2707991 looking and seeing all three of us together pretty much at the 200 i wasnt really comfortable with having that close of a race
2707992 i usually have more of a gap but it made my breaststroke a lot stronger
2707993 i looked up and he waved the flag and nodded his head
2707994 that was a pretty cool feeling to have the president say congratulations and have him in the crowd
2707995 i did everything i could so thats all i can ask for
2707996 that was amazing setting another world record you cant ask for anything else that was a great way to start off the meet for usa
2707997 the volunteers listened to chinese words because they use pitch to signal meaning
2707998 the musicians brains were more sensitive for picking up the pitch patterns
2707999 the earlier the musicians began the training the stronger the effect the longer they had been playing also the greater the effect
2708000 the brain stem showed greater sensitivity and fidelity in response to sounds that were linguistic
2708001 having musical training affects the fidelity with sounds that you hear it will enable you to hear nuances in peoples tones of voice
2708002 music training can help kids hear in a noisy classroom or kids with hearing problems it could help children learn how to read
2708003 its not necessarily about becoming musicians but about enhancing a part of their sensory systems
2708004 self discipline the ability to work with people and cooperation

2708006 we wanted to share our academic work with the security community and had planned to withhold a key detail of our results so that a malicious attacker could not use our research for fraudulent purposes
2708007 were disappointed that the court is preventing us from presenting our findings even with this safeguard
2708008 the courts order is an illegal prior restraint on legitimate academic research in violation of the first amendment
2708009 the court has adopted an interpretation of the statute that is blatantly unconstitutional equating discussion in a public forum with computer intrusion security and the public interest benefit immensely from the free flow of ideas and information on vulnerabilities more importantly squelching research and scientific discussion wont stop the attackers it will just stop the public from knowing that these systems are vulnerable and from pressuring the companies that develop and implement them to fix security holes
2708010 everyone says lebronze is for recreational fun but every player in the league wont deny the fact that they want to win i hope 23 brings his a game and leads his team to victory

2708013 brotherhoods youth should be their advantage but the veteran leadership of stylin on you might overwhelm their opponents
2708014 this will be a great learning experience for the brotherhood
2708015 hes on the roster but doesnt mean were going to play him
2708016 we know how to play it fair we actually dont need him against untouchables
2708017 a few seasons ago 626ers went 8 0 but had an early exit in the playoffs this seasons roster is much more improved and more dangerous and this is probably their best chance to not lose early in the playoffs again
2708018 i find it ironic that we had to move up from gold to platinum because of christian gopez but now look at the rosters of the gold teams
2708019 it is the way it is now because of what happened to elements
2708020 elements did bad following that season when they had to move up and it proved that having 1 all star cant change the outcome of the game considerably
2708021 ive never really been a scorer ive always wanted to pass the ball
2708022 i just want to see how it feels like to be the main scorer and have fun with it complete with the prima donna attitude and all so for once let me play into this kobe character and uh i heard elements is going to double team me i dont expect anything less id double team me if i were elements too
2708023 they just got engaged it happened within the past few days

2708029 as the government of the united states of america is not in any sense founded on the christian religion as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws religion or tranquility of musselmen and as the said states never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any mohamitan nation it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries
2708030 i would probably have to say yes that the constitution established the united states of america as a christian nation
2708031 it is a truism that almost any sect cult or religion will legislate its creed into law if it acquires the political power to do so
2708032 the development of science and of the creative activities of the spirit in general requires still another kind of freedom which may be characterised as inward freedom it is this freedom of spirit which consists in the independence of thought from the restrictions of authoritarian and social prejudices as well as from unphilosophical routinizing and habit in general this inward freedom is an infrequent gift of nature and a worthy objective for the individual schools may favour such freedom by encouraging independent thought only if outward and inner freedom are constantly and consciously pursued is there a possibility of spiritual development and perfection and thus of improving mans outward and inner life
2708033 the separation of church and state is extremely important to any of us who holds to the original traditions of our nation to change these traditions by changing our traditional attitude toward public education would be harmful to our whole attitude of tolerance in the religion area if we look at situations which have arisen in the past in europe and other world areas i think we will see the reasons why it is wise to hold to our early traditions
2708034 if religious freedom is to endure in america the responsibility for teaching religion to public school children must be left to the homes and churches of our land where this responsibility rightfully belongs it must not be assumed by the government through the agency of the public school system
2708035 there is in every village a torch the teacher and an extinguisher the clergyman
2708036 the public schools of this country serve the admirable function of bringing together on common ground students from a diversity of cultural and religious backgrounds the introduction of public prayer into such a setting jeopardizes the sense of community and unnecessarily intrudes an emotional and divisive faction
2708037 a professor of theology should have no place in our institution
2708038 the priests of the different religious sects dread the advance of science as witches do the approach of daylight and scowl on the fatal harbinger announcing the subdivision of the duperies on which they live
2708039 a public school teacher occupies a position of great trust with potentially great influence over young people whose attendance is compulsory a person should not be allowed to take advantage of such a position to promote his or her own or any religion
2708040 secular schools can never be tolerated because such a school has no religious instruction and a general moral instruction without a religious foundation is built on air consequently all character training and religion must be derived from faith we need believing people
2708041 i hope i live to see the day when as in the early days of our country we wont have any public schools the churches will have taken them over again and christians will be running them what a happy day that will be
2708042 were going to bring back god and the bible and drive the gods of secular humanism right out of the public schools of america
2708043 the christian community has a golden opportunity to train an army of dedicated teachers who can invade the public school classrooms and use them to influence the nation for christ
2708044 let us remember that there are multiple theories of intelligent design i and many others around the world are of the strong belief that the universe was created by a flying spaghetti monster it was he who created all that we see and all that we feel we feel strongly that the overwhelming scientific evidence pointing towards evolutionary processes is nothing but a coincidence put in place by him it is for this reason that im writing you today to formally request that this alternative theory be taught in your schools along with the other two theories in fact i will go so far as to say if you do not agree to do this we will be forced to proceed with legal action im sure you see where we are coming from if the intelligent design theory is not based on faith but instead another scientific theory as is claimed then you must also allow our theory to be taught as it is also based on science not on faith some find that hard to believe so it may be helpful to tell you a little more about our beliefs we have evidence that a flying spaghetti monster created the universe none of us of course were around to see it but we have written accounts of it we have several lengthy volumes explaining all details of his power also you may be surprised to hear that there are over 10 million of us and growing we tend to be very secretive as many people claim our beliefs are not substantiated by observable evidence what these people dont understand is that he built the world to make us think the earth is older than it really is for example a scientist may perform a carbon dating process on an artifact he finds that approximately 75 of the carbon 14 has decayed by electron emission to nitrogen 14 and infers that this artifact is approximately 10 000 years old as the half life of carbon 14 appears to be 5 730 years but what our scientist does not realize is that every time he makes a measurement the flying spaghetti monster is there changing the results with his noodly appendage we have numerous texts that describe in detail how this can be possible and the reasons why he does this he is of course invisible and can pass through normal matter with ease you may be interested to know that global warming earthquakes hurricanes and other natural disasters are a direct effect of the shrinking numbers of pirates since the 1800s for your interest i have included a graph of the approximate number of pirates versus the average global temperature over the last 200 years as you can see there is a statistically significant inverse relationship between pirates and global temperature
2708045 i cannot imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation and is but a reflection of human frailty
2708046 part of the strength of science is that it has tended to attract individuals who love knowledge and the creation of it
2708047 every act of creation is first of all an act of destruction
2708048 how is it that hardly any major religion has looked at science and concluded
2708049 no no no my god is a little god and i want him to stay that way
2708050 i would like to thank providence and the almighty for choosing me of all people to be allowed to wage this battle for germany
2708051 a person who is guided by god will never be misguided by anyone
2708052 if this were a dictatorship it would be a heck of a lot easier so long as im the dictator
2708053 if you believe in the existence of fairies at the bottom of the garden you are deemed fit for the bin if you believe in parthenogenesis ascension transubstantiation and all the rest of it you are deemed fit to govern the country
2708054 a tyrant must put on the appearance of uncommon devotion to religion subjects are less apprehensive of illegal treatment from a ruler whom they consider to be god fearing and pious
2708055 the urge to save humanity is almost always only a false face for the urge to rule it
2708056 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in a flag carrying a cross
2708057 naturally the common people dont want war but they can always be brought to the bidding of their leaders tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and endangering the country it works the same in every country
2708058 no i dont know that atheists should be considered as citizens nor should they be considered as patriots this is one nation under god
2708059 i want you to just let a wave of intolerance wash over you i want you to let a wave of hatred wash over you yes hate is good our goal is a christian nation we have a biblical duty we are called by god to conquer this country we dont want equal time we dont want pluralism
2708060 the status of atheists today is on par with that of homosexuals fifty years ago now after the gay pride movement it is possible though still not very easy for a homosexual to be elected to public office a gallup poll taken in 1999 asked americans whether they would vote for an otherwise well qualified person who was a woman 95 would roman catholic 94 would jew 92 black 92 mormon 79 homosexual 79 or atheist 49 american polls suggest that atheists and agnostics far outnumber religious jews and even outnumber most other particular religious groups unlike jews however who are notoriously one of the most effective political lobbies in the united states and unlike evangelical christians who wield even greater political power atheists and agnostics are not organized and therefore exert almost zero influence indeed organizing atheists has been compared to herding cats because they tend to think independently and will not conform to authority even if they cant be herded cats in sufficient numbers can make a lot of noise and they cannot be ignored
2708061 what can you ever really know of other peoples souls of their temptations their opportunities their struggles one soul in the whole creation you do know and it is the only one whose fate is placed in your hands
2708062 the following seven characteristics of the cults provide insight into their sameness 1
2708063 the god of the old testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction jealous and proud of it a petty unjust unforgiving control freak a vindictive bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser a misogynistic homophobic racist infanticidal genocidal filicidal pestilential megalomaniacal sadomasochistic capriciously malevolent bully
2708064 man is the religious animal he is the only religious animal he is the only animal that has the true religion several of them he is the only animal that loves his neighbor as himself and cuts his throat if his theology isnt straight he has made a graveyard of the globe in trying his honest best to smooth his brothers path to happiness and heaven
2708065 it is an interesting and demonstrable fact that all children are atheists and were religion not inculcated into their minds they would remain so
2708066 when i was a kid i used to pray every night for a new bicycle then i realized that the lord in his wisdom didnt work that way so i stole one and asked him to forgive me
2708067 if your plan is for one year plant rice if your plan is for ten years plant trees if your plan is for one hundred years educate children
2708068 i think we should all wince when we hear a small child being labeled as belonging to some particular religion or another small children are too young to decide their views on the origins of the cosmos of life and of morals the very sound of the phrase christian child or muslim child should grate like fingernails on a blackboard our society including the non religious sector has accepted the preposterous idea that it is normal and right to indoctrinate tiny children in the religion of their parents and to slap religious labels on them catholic child protestant child jewish child muslim child etc although no other comparable labels no conservative children no liberal children no republican children no democrat children please please raise your consciousness about this and raise the roof whenever you hear it happening a child is not a christian child not a muslim child but a child of christian parents or a child of muslim parents this latter nomenclature by the way would be an excellent piece of consciousness raising for the children themselves a child who is told she is a child of muslim parents will immediately realize that religion is something for her to choose or reject when she becomes old enough to do so
2708069 being fondled by the priest simply left the impression in the mind of a 7 year old as yucky while the memory of my friend going to hell was one of cold immeasurable fear i never lost sleep because of the priest but i spent many a night being terrified that the people i loved would go to hell it gave me nightmares
2708070 religion has certain ideas at the heart of it which we call sacred or holy or whatever
2708071 here is an idea or a notion that youre not allowed to say anything bad about youre just not why not because youre not
2708072 i why should it be that its perfectly legitimate to support the labour party or the conservative party republicans or democrats this model of economics versus that macintosh instead of windows but to have an opinion about how the universe began about who created the universe no thats holy we are used to not challenging religious ideas but its interesting how much of a furore richard dawkins creates when he does it everybody gets absolutely frantic about it because youre not allowed to say these things yet when you look at it rationally there is no reason why those ideas shouldnt be as open to debate as any other except that we have agreed somehow between us that they shouldnt be
2708073 if you pray for rain long enough it eventually does fall if you pray for floodwaters to abate they eventually do the same happens in the absence of prayers
2708074 the bible tells us to be like god and then on page after page it describes god as a mass murderer this may be the single most important key to the political behavior of western civilization
2708075 when you can turn people on their head and shake them and no money falls out then you know gods saying
2708076 men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction
2708077 could a being create the fifty billion galaxies each with two hundred billion stars then rejoice in the smell of burning goat flesh
2708078 i read about an eskimo hunter who asked the local missionary priest if i did not know about god and sin would i go to hell no said the priest not if you did not know then why asked the eskimo earnestly did you tell me
2708079 every war when it comes or before it comes is represented not as a war but as an act of self defense against a homicidal maniac
2708080 our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor with the cry of grave national emergency always there has been some terrible evil at home or some monstrous foreign power that was going to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it
2708081 christianity the belief that a cosmic jewish zombie who was his own father can make you live forever if you symbolically eat his flesh and telepathically tell him you accept him as your master so he can remove an evil force from your soul that is present in humanity because a rib woman was convinced by a talking snake to eat from a magical tree yeah makes perfect sense
2708082 now i wont say a word to him his friend ive romantic moments with u im being romantic

2708110 one of the biggest frustrations is what arrogance these people think we are stupid
2708111 we are in the business of gymnastics and we know what a kid of 14 or 15 or 16 looks like you dont have to be a gymnastics coach to know what they look like at 16
2708112 karolyi working the games for nbc believes the international federations rules that gymnasts must turn at least 16 during the olympic year are flawed karolyis complaints are nothing new
2708113 they are 12 14 years old max and they line them up for the world
2708114 since they forced an age limit it has gotten worse and worse
2708115 international gymnastics federation fig officials have accepted the passports of the chinese women which indicate all are old enough to compete
2708116 the only situation is to lift up the age limit it would be an even playing field for everyone
2708117 they do good gymnastics and are a good service for the sport

2708121 ive not been playing well the last few months i dont know why ive not practised well and not been concentrated on the tennis

2708125 mullah bari ghul was directly responsible for the importation of componentry the provision of specialists in the construction of ieds improvised explosive devices and authorising their emplacement across the province

2708127 the loss of the one person who knew what was currently underway what was planned for the future and had the contacts to gain further support is a significant blow to the taliban extremists command and control in the province

2708147 there are no words to describe the terrible suffering of my people at this moment the chinese government is relentlessly crushing the tibetan people when they desire nothing more than the restoration of their basic rights and freedom tibetans are being killed silenced and marginalized our precious religion strangled as the chinese government attempts to extinguish all trace of tibetan identity i am protesting today to tell the world that while it stares mesmerized at chinas olympic games my people are being crushed under the boot of chinese oppression

2708168 el recurso m s importante es que los valencianos se seguir n dando cuenta del agravio comparativo del gobierno central con los valencianos y alicantinos

2708202 a story in which a young writer catches calliopes attention
2708203 the word muse and the word amuse have the same root
2708204 calliope tries hard to win the writers love but his heart is taken it is melpomene that he wants he asks calliope to leave him melpomene accepts him but from that moment everything goes wrong in his life his books dont sell anymore
2708205 in a year he is poor and out on the streets
2708206 he wanders around on the streets still thinking about the greatest story ever written melpomene only smiles he asks her why he suffers he tells her he loves her one day she tells him that his quest is absurd and his own story is one of the tragic stories she has seen and it speaks magnitudes of a human beings obsession and dissatisfaction disappointed he starts looking for calliope again but doesnt find her ever again he dies of starvation on the street next to a garbage dump

2708225 afterwards i looked up and saw president bush giving me the thumbs up and holding up the american flag that was pretty cool
2708226 i was pretty emotional after that race i was not that comfortable in the first 200m

2708241 there is no relation between the senior advocate r gandhi or the pil filed by him and the government and it has been filed by him in his individual capacity
2708242 the granting of classical language status is decided by the expert committee formed for this purpose by the central government which submits its recommendation to the government
2708243 we certainly will be impressing on our athletes through their sports section managers that when their competition finishes and they go downtown it would be wise to be branded
2708244 we really should be insisting they should wear their team gear i think that might be a small precaution i think there is more likelihood of people keeping an eye out for you security and volunteers if you are in olympic gear
2708245 the district administration has lifted curfew in border towns of kathua and poonch since 0600 hours on sunday after four days of its imposition in view of betterment in law and order situation
2708246 curfew was reimposed all these districts army also conducted flag marches in jammu and samba districts
2708247 however there were no violent clashes with police or army at any place there were no violent protests the situation is tense but under control
2708248 ive not been playing well the last few months i dont know why ive not practised well and not been concentrated on the tennis
2708249 im happy to win and but i didnt enjoy playing in these tough conditions
2708250 i dont know the last two years ive played so many tournaments trying to keep getting good results and defending points
2708251 if i dont play tennis for a few days i dont care really i dont know how many days i can hold the racket just feeling so tired playing tennis
2708252 i dont do anything no fitness no running no anything for me as a professional player its not so good i hope i can come back and find some concentration
2708253 i wanted to play at the olympics but im not expecting a good result
2708254 maybe if i play less i will find the hunger for tennis again and start practising and start doing some running and fitness rather than just playing an hour a day
2708255 politics is the business of getting power and privilege without possessing merit
2708256 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
2708257 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
2708258 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
2708259 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
2708260 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
2708261 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
2708262 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
2708263 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
2708264 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
2708265 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
2708266 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
2708267 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
2708268 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
2708269 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
2708270 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
2708271 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
2708272 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
2708273 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
2708274 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
2708275 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
2708276 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
2708277 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
2708278 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
2708279 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
2708280 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
2708281 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
2708282 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
2708283 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
2708284 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
2708285 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets
2708286 this labour government is the most mendacious dishonest endemically corrupt power hungry incompetent illiberal fucking shower of shits that has ruled this country
2708287 im looking forward to having more races as is planned for the future
2708288 though i wouldnt mind missing one or two tests actually the tests have been reduced quite a lot over the last two or three years but i hope we have more races because there is not one that i dont like
2708289 im looking forward to going to india and the other interesting new places currently being discussed

2708295 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2708296 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2708297 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2708298 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2708299 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2708300 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2708301 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2708302 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2708309 the issue of condoms which are very fundamental have been left out completely the money goes to churches but unfortunately this money has specifically been designed for what i would call moralistic behavior and so i am not surprised that there is an upsurge of hiv in this country
2708310 i have been a preacher for 33 years now so when i believed jesus and when i started reading the bible i knew that jesus said go into the whole world and preach the gospel and also heal the sick in my name we pray for the sick people some of them get healed and some dont and if they dont get healed we refer them to hospital you cant impose healing on some body if some body doesnt get healed where does he go to the hospital
2708311 there is a group especially from the american community who has been funding initiatives that are basically faith based in approach
2708312 the aids commission still promotes abc as a strategy in fact we are talking of abc plus because there are new initiatives that have come on board like medical male circumcisions like anti retroviral therapy like increased voluntary counseling and testing and empowerment of women
2708313 people in the communities are still having a lot of problems people are still dying even if drugs are there there is not sufficient education about these drugs and so the problems are still very big many other people have come in religious institutions come in others says they can heal hiv others have become very condemnatory you find these new sects saying people should not use condoms that condoms are not accepted and they should not even be promoted there are what i would call conflicting messages that are going around
2708314 we already have a collection of ideas from the grassroots we can no longer plan anything at the national level without getting the involvement of the local communities at the end of the day that is where the majority of our people live
2708315 as a building society we always aim to offer our members the best possible deals
2708316 customers can have confidence taking a mortgage with nationwide whether they are buying re mortgaging or coming to the end of their existing deals
2708317 we will have to seek how to deal with the amarnath land issue we will definitely make efforts that it is resolved in a manner in which it does not hurt the sentiments of people of jammu as well as people of kashmir
2708318 the prime minister has also said that it should continue as in the past
2708319 there should be no communalisation of the situation there have been some incidents but we will tackle these
2708320 media can also make mistakes we request you to see what is covered is fact and done in a manner that it does not hurt sentiments of people
2708321 we will compensate the victims of violence we will compensate the near and dear ones of those who have been killed
2708322 the district administration has lifted curfew in border towns of kathua and poonch since 0600 hours today after four days of its imposition in view of betterment in law and order situation
2708323 curfew was reimposed in all these districts army also conducted flag marches in jammu and samba districts
2708324 we know people are feeling the pinch right now and want to help make mortgages more affordable that is why our fee free switching package is an excellent deal for anyone whose current mortgage deal is coming to an end
2708325 the indication that the government is looking to suspend stamp duty is very encouraging
2708326 when you reach your 50s you finally become comfortable in your own skin it is the decade of your life when you can truly become an individual and do all the things that you have wanted to do
2708327 people in their 50s tend to know their own mind and as a result of their life experience they can enjoy more fun and freedom than people much younger than them it is this down to earth and flexible attitude that gives this generation the golden qualities which means theyre unphased by most of the challenges that life throws at them
2708328 we are in the middle of a perfect economic storm and consumers need to batten down the hatches if they havent done so already
2708329 there are no quick fixes to britains financial mess and homeowners need to help themselves by reducing debt this will not be easy given the pressures on household budgets
2708330 we hope that the natwest student living index is a useful tool for students and their parents to give a realistic idea of what costs are involved and how they can potentially be offset by a part time job
2708331 we did it it was perfect its a dream come true
2708332 i want to thank all the people who have been there from the start i have worked so hard i am so happy

2708342 they claim its been going in budget support but thats not the answer were talking about 700m a year missing the rest has been taken by mush for some scheme or other and weve got to find it

2708366 we are extremely concerned and surprised to see reference to kcc in relation to the news item on the dumping of obsolete ict equipment in ghana
2708367 kcc disposals are organised through specialist third party companies and the council places emphasis on its contracts on the standards to be followed throughout the disposals process
2708368 the council is now urgently seeking additional information to identify serial numbers this will help establish which of our suppliers had responsibility for disposal of the items
2708369 the reports indicate a clear failure to comply with contractual obligations and if an audit trail can be established the council will take action against the company concerned
2708370 the council has a responsibility to make sure its waste goes to the right place there needs to be an investigation into this
2708371 a lot of computers kcc doesnt want anymore could be recycled and used in kents schools thus saving them money
2708372 a new directive will eventually ensure all computer waste ends up back with the companies that produced them in the first place
2708373 its not good enough for kcc to pass the responsibility onto other people
2708374 its okay to drink your drugs we meant those other untaxed drugs those are the ones that you cant do

2708485 let african leaders turn a new leaf let them know their responsibilities let them know they are facing a major challenge of how to move the continent forward people would be happy with them if they do these said babatunde odunlami a lecturer in the department of history and strategic studies at the olabisi onabanjo university in ago iwoye south west nigeria and when some military boys come out to topple any government they would find it difficult to get support because people would resist the intervention
2708486 they are not making it too neat for us that democratic governance are better alternative because of their behaviours when they get to power this is a continent that is well blessed with various resources i just pray our leaders would channel it to transform their countries
2708487 the military take over power in africa because the civilian government are not performing well it is the bad rule that usually provides opportunities for some ambitious officers to capitalise on prof olusanya said
2708488 many of our leaders instead of taking care of the needs of the people usually engage in self aggrandisement and accumulation of wealth at the detriment of the people they swore to serve the way out is to promote the peoples welfare respect for the rule of law and shun corrupt practices democracy remains the best form of government military rule can never be a better alternative

2708512 gab2 is a signalling protein which means that its involved in transmitting signals from the cell surface to the interior of the cell instructing it to do specific things such as divide or migrate
2708513 gab2 performs a number of signalling roles in normal cells throughout the body and is usually switched off when its not needed our task has been to work out how the body switches off gab2 so that we can mimic that process in abnormal cells
2708514 weve identified a completely novel mechanism for switching off gab2 this uses another molecule that attaches to gab2 and acts as a kind of shield preventing it from transmitting further proliferative signals
2708515 this binding partner or off switch is called 14 3 3 and is used to disable gab2 in a number of cellular settings when it is no longer needed
2708516 as gab2 plays key roles in signalling systems that underpin both normal physiological responses and oncogenesis its very important to understand its control mechanisms
2708517 our next step will be to obtain more structural information about how 14 3 3 shields gab2 once we know that it should be possible to design drugs to combat gab2 activated diseases in novel ways
2708518 it shows community wide prevention programmes are feasible among maori and likely to result in significant reductions in the incidence of diabetes

2708521 the kaupapa of te wai o rona is to ensure the valuable information and learning from the programme is used to support actions which will have long term benefits for the maori community and the future health of all new zealand

2708563 zeker er is verschil tussen wat de samenleving met straffen wil en wat de professionele rechter wil ik denk dat dit onvermijdelijk is de rechter houdt veel meer strafdoelen in het oog dan alleen de vergelding van het aangedane leed je ziet ook dat naarmate de informatie van de burger toeneemt het verschil in bestraffingsniveau terugloopt wat je ook ziet is dat het de burger eerst en vooral om de kwaliteit van de rechter te doen is de integriteit de onafhankelijkheid en onpartijdigheid van de rechter dat vindt de burger het belangrijkst als het over rechtspraak gaat de roep om strenger straffen staat pas op de zesde plaats de onkreukbaarheid van de rechter wordt veel belangrijker gevonden dat idee van dat strenger straffen wordt wel steeds opnieuw gevoed in de politiek en de media maar in de praktijk blijkt het reuze mee te vallen

2708574 we ought to have the building up of zion as our greatest object the time is soon coming when no man will have any peace but in zion and her stakes 1839
2708575 if zion will not purify herself so as to be approved of in all things in his sight he will seek another people for his work will go on until israel is gathered and they who will not hear his voice must expect to feel his wrath
2708576 so long as unrighteous acts are suffered in the church it cannot be sanctified neither can zion be redeemed
2708577 let every one labor to prepare himself for the vineyard sparing a little time to comfort the mourners to bind up the broken hearted to reclaim the backslider to bring back the wanderer to re invite into the kingdom such as have been cut off by encouraging them to lay to while the day lasts and work righteousness and with one heart and one mind prepare to help redeem zion that goodly land of promise where the willing and the obedient shall be blessed

2708580 submitted an application for a grading permit to go and do test borings in areas that they feel may be acceptable to build these wind turbines and the application was processed
2708581 they brought the plans in already signed by the soil conservation district
2708582 for the most part thats all we need for the grading permit we issued the permit
2708583 we made it clear to them theres no zoning certification granted with this authorization to proceed
2708584 to see where its acceptable where they may put turbines
2708585 ive always wanted to ask a lot of people in the town what do you think about them
2708586 it could happen we have to be aware of the implications there are bad implications and there are good implications
2708587 if it does happen well do our best to make sure that landowners are taken into consideration
2708588 the closer you are you should be compensated wed want to make sure that affected landowners are taken care of reasonably if there are wind towers near them
2708589 if we were approached by a company my feeling is the public votes
2708590 as a board were trying to be arms length with this
2708591 the developer company carries out evacuation arrangement and gets this cost reimbursed by the local distribution licensee 50 per cent and the green cess 50 per cent
2708592 there is no doubt wind power and other renewable sources of energy need to be promoted but at present too many incentives are offered to private wind farm developers that are not translating into more green power to consumers promoters need a conducive environment but that should not translate into unnecessary private profits with no public good
2708593 if the plf was below 12 per cent then no subsidy was given but as the plf increased the sales tax rebate also increased a 12 per cent plf got 50 per cent sales tax subsidy 13 per cent plf got 60 per cent plf above 17 per cent got 100 per cent sales tax rebate
2708594 in india there is no correct data on cost per mw of wind turbine generator wtg companies like suzlon sell their 1 5 mw wtg for over rs 9 crore but what is its actual manufacture cost no one knows this data is not available in the public domain
2708595 a wind farm developer approaches an investor telling him all he needs to do is get the bank loan for capital investment rest is taken care of
2708596 in return the investor gets income tax benefits and also money through selling generated wind energy to the grid the developer gets to sell turbines and is paid annually for operation and maintenance o amp m
2708597 neg macon asks for rs 9 50 lakh per annum per wind energy generator weg with an escalation of 7 5 per cent per annum as ohm charge this increases to rs 16 lakh per annum per weg after the 5th year of commissioning suzlon demands rs 17 lakh per weg per annum as o amp m charges this is nothing but loot there are no running charges for a farm running on free wind
2708598 what do we know about the promises of wind energy and the inconvenient truths
2708599 in 1999 2001 and 2003 when congress temporarily killed the credits the number of new turbines dropped dramatically
2708600 it will be accomplished solely through private investment with no new consumer or corporate taxes or government regulation
2708601 i would never want to belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member
2708602 als je nu nog aan me blijft hangen ligt de verantwoordelijkheid vanaf nu definitief bij jou doe het niet

2708604 ive not been playing well the last few months i dont know why ive not practised well and not been concentrated on the tennis
2708605 im happy to win and but i didnt enjoy playing in these tough conditions
2708606 i dont know the last two years ive played so many tournaments trying to keep getting good results and defending points
2708607 if i dont play tennis for a few days i dont care really i dont know how many days i can hold the racket just feeling so tired playing tennis
2708608 i dont do anything no fitness no running no anything for me as a professional player its not so good i hope i can come back and find some concentration
2708609 i wanted to play at the olympics but im not expecting a good result
2708610 maybe if i play less i will find the hunger for tennis again and start practising and start doing some running and fitness rather than just playing an hour a day
2708611 theyre going to be hanging over the back of our house and now theres the medical thing
2708612 all these problems were resolved as soon as these people got away from the turbines got in the car and drove away from the house
2708613 weve had a number of other wind farms over the country and residents living by them and never had any problems
2708614 when you come home from work everything drains away from you because its so quiet and peaceful
2708615 the main issue to make people aware of is that where we are wind farm applications will affect people in a very wide area
2708616 there are lots of people who are opposing the wind farm in swinford but who arent necessarily involved with the campaign group and the meeting was an opportunity for them to find out more about what is going on
2708617 other sections are at the proof reading stage and will be submitted before the objection deadline on august 31
2708618 we are also in the process of choosing who will be speaking at the planning meeting in october
2708619 they will be properly qualified speakers it wont be joe bloggs with a chip on his shoulder
2708620 my preparation was good but i had practised in and colorado as i was expecting the heat and i was more prepared to the conditions the men had yesterday
2708621 i really did not find it so hot in the last couple of days
2708622 i stayed a little bit behind the bunch to avoid crashes its always silly to have prepared so hard to end up crashing out
2708623 its a pity we had to do this long ride across in beijing it would have been better to ride more laps of the circuit
2708624 i just could not react my legs were too stiff and at my age it is hard for the muscles to recuperate in the cold
2708625 it just very disappointing because i was in great shape and should have been in contention
2708626 in a way this race gave me a chance to check the course i simply hope the weather improves
2708627 a fortune teller told me if i changed my name i would go far so i changed it because i wanted to go to the olympics
2708628 last time i didnt make it and now i wanted to go in
2708629 i was a bit nervous but you have to be able to deal with the pressure
2708630 it was all new for me today but british coach terry edwards sat me down and helped me get things clear in my head
2708631 hes a well polished opponent and i beat him by more than 10 points
2708632 it was a mature performance from the youngest member of our team a tremendous performance
2708633 it was 26 26 and i won on the countback
2708634 now ive been in the ring here i hope i can get better and better through the tournament
2708635 it will be a battle to the end but im in it to win a medal for

2708706 flushing occurs because the vasomotor system the part of the brain that controls temperature in the body dilates your vessels veins and arteries to give the blood a bigger surface area and therefore cool it down
2708707 its called vasodilation and thats why you go red theres a bigger blood flow around the body
2708708 you flush if youre embarrassed because neurotransmitters in your brain signal this emotion and that causes the central nervous system to produce chemicals which make the vessels dilate
2708709 the hormone oestrogen regulates the hypothalamus which is the heat stabilisation centre in the brain so when your oestrogen is low it can cause hot flushes
2708710 theres some evidence that the herb black cohosh is very effective at treating hormonal flushing because it mimics oestrogen
2708711 theres also anecdotal evidence that sepia tablets a homeopathic remedy can help flushes i have had many patients who found that it helped

2708842 the department of agriculture western cape wholeheartedly supports the initiative and agrees that 2010 soccer world cup is the ideal opportunity to present a truly unique south african wine pinotage wine at the official functions during the world cup celebrations will assist to strengthen the image and value of pinotage
2708843 if the request is accepted we will donate a sufficient quantity of wood matured pinotage wine for official functions and for participants and winners of the 2010 soccer world cup we do not want to become involved in the commercial opportunities as there are enough cellars and other instances that are structured to do this

2708846 the average size of the prey captured by the colony increased 20 fold as colony size increased from less than 100 to 10 000 spiders

2708851 im embarrassed to admit that after all these years in politics i failed to interpret your previous assurances as typical rhetorical gloss routinely used in politics to make self interested partisan posturing appear more noble

2708865 i came to india on a fulbright scholarship in 2006 to make a movie on kashmir i made zero bridge almost single handedly
2708866 the wests understanding of kashmir is partial and bollywood uses kashmir only as an exotic backdrop
2708867 so i kept my screenplay away and explained to them the movies important scenes and gave them simple dialogue to deliver the result was that though they were all novices they ended up giving their natural performances
2708868 i was detained in the police station before i could convince the officers that i was innocent no i was not bitter but the episode is a troubling reminder of how fragile the social structure has become in kashmir after years of unrest

2708884 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

2708888 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
2708889 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
2708890 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
2708891 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2708892 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2708893 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
2708894 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
2708895 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
2708896 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
2708897 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
2708898 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
2708899 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
2708900 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
2708901 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
2708902 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
2708903 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
2708904 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
2708905 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
2708906 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
2708907 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
2708908 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
2708909 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
2708910 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
2708911 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
2708912 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
2708913 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

2708917 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
2708918 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
2708919 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
2708920 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
2708921 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
2708922 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
2708923 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
2708924 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2708925 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
2708926 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
2708927 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2708928 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2708929 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
2708930 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
2708931 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
2708932 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
2708933 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
2708934 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
2708935 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
2708936 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
2708937 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
2708938 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
2708939 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
2708940 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
2708941 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
2708942 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
2708943 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
2708944 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
2708945 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
2708946 christians should attempt to avoid drinking alcohol especially when in the presence of non believers
2708947 one is not in control of ones faculties when under the influence of alcohol and is liable to do or say something that might bring shame to the name of our lord this would crucify him afresh
2708948 be not drunk with wine if anything offends it can allow the unbeliever to perceive an undesirable lifestyle and give the appearance of evil
2708949 1 or 2 maybe ok but more then that i dont think so
2708950 if you select to have a moderate drink with other christian strong believers like yourself there is not much harm or offense to god almighty because whilst youre in company of other gods people your conversation and time spent would just be talking and sharing gods word amongst yourselves
2708951 in itself drinking alcohol would not hurt a christians witness but whatever will make people look down on your christian faith should be avoided
2708952 my grandmother drank a small glass of wine each night to help her relax and the doctor said it would work as well or better than sleeping pills i certainly dont think it made her any less of a christian
2708953 i believe that alcohol drinking should be a personal conviction for each christian
2708954 depends on your relationship with the people who know you are drinking and your example that they know
2708955 there are certainly many verses in the bible that reference a christians authority to do so the majority of those polled felt that true believers have the power to exorcise evil spirits
2708956 if a christian truly believes that jesus name is above every name and that they have authority in jesus name then yes they can command that thing to come out
2708957 no any christian cant cast out a demon a person has to be spirit filled and truly anointed in my opinion to operate fully in the holy ghost
2708958 no not in todays world but they should have holy power which comes only through prayer and fasting i would only attempt this with three to six strong christian men of god who were preachers that love and fear god
2708959 im not quite sure i know it was done in bible times and i do believe its possible but i dont know that i have that specific gift if thats what it would take
2708960 i am so disappointed at the lack of effectiveness in the christian world that i no longer feel casting out demons is for our era
2708961 while a slight majority of christians feel that the battle over oil has nothing to do with the battle of armageddon nearly just as many surmise that the demand for fuel may be the catalyst for global conflict
2708962 armageddon has nothing to do with a physical substance but human existence the lord is going to come with the saints to battle for the souls of mankind its about who is saved or born again by accepting jesus christ as their lord and savior and who is not
2708963 read the book of revelation carefully and you will see that armageddon is a spiritual battle between christ and his enemies which culminates at his second coming
2708964 i dont know ive read revelation and unless i missed it there was no mention of oil as the cause of armageddon
2708965 who knows only god knows what will be the final straw as long as god is in control of all this mess i will leave the end results to him after all weve read the final chapter and we know who wins
2708966 the whole world economy is dependent on the supply and demand for oil and supplier nations use fuel as a strategic weapon if nations are cut off from oil supplies suffer from economic collapse they will join in the fray to fight for oil
2708967 armageddon will be fought over oil and israel the super powers of the world will not let the resources of that region go uncontested oil is the one thing we all depend upon
2708968 believers are divided over whether god is using recent natural calamities to bring judgment however only time will tell
2708969 the bible tells us that in the last days these things will come to pass america is in a backslidden condition which brings gods judgment all the wickedness in the world from homosexuality and abortions to child molestations and the occult and so on are resulting in judgment jesus is surely coming for his church soon
2708970 katrina in new orleans is a prime example new orleans was a sin city america is becoming a sin country as a result of declining christianity we will see more disasters in our lifetime here in the usa
2708971 god will not punish the just with the unjust the natural disasters are natural results of mans unwise acts man does things scientifically that confuse nature and then disaster strikes
2708972 god is love never hate god created nature and allowed nature to evolve so i cant see a loving god using the beauty he created to punish mankind it just would not make sense only humankind abuses nature
2708973 maybe yes or no but as for this time the world is becoming worse and worse this is a sign that the coming of our lord is very near
2708974 probably some are but we cannot judge in any event i think christs return could be any time praise the lord
2708975 most believers feel that women should dress conservatively rather than in revealing or sensual attire which may cause the opposite sex to lust
2708976 absolutely not even some women who call themselves christians often dress like prostitutes short shorts low cut tops backless dresses flip flops etc the bible directs us to dress modestly having respect for our bodies and dressing in a manner that honors our lord
2708977 we wouldnt be able to see the president of the united states or the queen of england dressed in that type of fashion lets respect god and his house and dress properly to please him for the past several years attending church has been more like walking into a whorehouse than a house of worship
2708978 god is not looking at the way we dress but at the attitude of our heart others take a more liberal attitude toward church attire especially for youth
2708979 allowing young people to worship in casual clothes brings more of them into the church i believe that attending church is more important than what they wear
2708980 it depends on a few issues different cultures influence how we dress people who are spiritually immature may not realize the impact their attire has on others
2708981 as sons of god we are to witness to sinners and the lost bars are very good place to find these type of individuals
2708982 because christ ate with tax collectors and prostitutes we are not here to witness to christians only we are made to bring his word to everyone everywhere it might be a problem for an alcoholic christian to witness in a bar so choose a friend to go in your stead
2708983 christians should witness at all times and in all places it doesnt matter if it is a bar or not
2708984 i dont believe christians should go to bars for any reason there is too much temptation there also i think it could hurt ones testimony to be seen in such a place
2708985 no because the message is lost among the words the noise and the drunken behavior
2708986 no first to stay away from temptations second i can witness to a person that goes to bar when he she comes out from the bar
2708987 i guess it depends on the christian if they are called to do that
2708988 i dont put any restrictions on where to witness if the holy spirit is leading and maybe the person overcame it and could help someone else out
2708989 a weak and inexperienced christian should probably not they may succumb to the urge to drink with the person they are witnessing to especially if they have a drinking problem themselves
2708990 most believers advocate reconstructive surgery to correct birth defects and deformities but are against having surgeries for vain reasons
2708991 for such deformities as cleft palates harelips and similar birth defects correction by surgery is permissible however people should not have surgery just to enhance their appearance out of vanity people should accept as gods gift any special feature he has decided to create in his creatures
2708992 i have studied the bible for 35 years and i havent found anything on it i also wonder about tattoos and body piercing and why so many young people are doing those things to their bodies
2708993 to correct a harelip or replace scarred and burned tissue does not fall under vanity spoken of in the bible however body piercing tattoos and nose and boob jobs fall into another category which does not honor the body or temple god gave us
2708994 its a question of degree and motivation why would cosmetic surgery following traumatic disfigurement be anti christian repairing a cleft palate this kind of surgery eases suffering
2708995 jesus healed therefore using cosmetic surgery in order to heal for physical mental or emotional reasons can certainly be considered biblical and scriptural
2708996 there will be a tight race for the presidency no matter who is running
2708997 no hes muslim and hes black no offense but when has a black or muslim man ever been elected i mean think logical
2708998 1 he does not respect the country 2 he says he does not support his own pastor when he is behind the pulpit be real how many of us join a club much less a church and dont agree with the administration
2708999 he is too liberal and too eager for change he cant possibly do all that he says hes just not realistic
2709000 he wants to change the way things are done here and im all for that
2709001 he has some good ideas and i would like to see them implemented before i die if the conservatives will allow it
2709002 the american people are sick of republicans and obama is the change they are looking for im voting for obama
2709003 at the moment it looks like obama may win but only god will make the one he wants to be in place for his will to be done
2709004 women and blacks were never wanted in politics now we have one woman and one black if obama wins it will be because they dont want mrs clinton because she is a woman and because of the scandal her husband caused in this nation years ago
2709005 i cant predict the future no one can so why bother just go out and vote
2709006 christians are torn between the fact that global warming is a cyclical event and the fact that we may be contributing
2709007 there have always been waves of variations in the worlds temperatures we can do all we can to prevent ourselves from contributing to temperature changes but ultimately god is in control
2709008 as a science major i can prove that everything is blown wildly out of proportion
2709009 according to scientists who actually know about weather we are not in a warming trend but even if we were it would not bring great catastrophe the earth goes through these warming and cooling trends cyclically and it is due to the tilt of the earth and other factors beyond our control in fact i have a picture taken in the 1900s of niagara falls frozen solid
2709010 it has a lot of effects like rise in sea level irregular seasons increase in global temperatures and increase in the prevalence of pests and diseases
2709011 it results in environmental degradation it pollutes the environment hence reducing on peoples life span
2709012 signs and symptoms of global warming are seen everywhere in the world
2709013 i believe it is happening i am just not sure how much of it is a natural course of nature or how much we can control
2709014 as christians we have a responsibility to god to maintain our environment in a condition that pleases him
2709015 while the bible offers no specific commandment against smoking the majority of christians feel that smoking is a bad habit which defiles the body both naturally and spiritually over half of those surveyed feel strongly that for born again believers using tobacco is a sin
2709016 i smoked for 43 years when i admitted that i loved cigarettes more than god but wanted to put him first god delivered me and ive been smoke free for 10 years
2709017 smoking is no more sinful than eating in excess drinking in excess and judging others in excess instead look at your own sins
2709018 i wouldnt call it sin but an awfully dirty and expensive habit not a very good testimony either
2709019 the bible says our bodies are temples for the holy spirit to dwell in so i am very sure that the spirit of the lord will not dwell in cigarette smoke on the other hand i dont believe you will go to hell for it
2709020 this is a hard one i am a smoker and i know my heart is right and i love christ more than anything
2709021 its not our job to judge whether someone is in sin or not thats gods job
2709022 an overwhelming number of christians assert that have made significant inroads in the church with unbiblical doctrine
2709023 most of them dont even realize they are false and think they are doing gods work pushing the peace and prosperity message and christian psychology instead of repentance and walking in the spirit
2709024 christians do not take their faith seriously their biblical foundation of the christian faith is quite shallow weak generalized and not grounded in the study of scriptures they continued infiltrators are familiar with believers weaknesses and can easily promote a distorted theology such as a materialistic and secular hope or use emotion to elicit a faith response
2709025 i am not sure but there have been a few things going on that a lot of us do not understand and do not agree with it is not only confusing but we dont know if we are to believe it or not god help us
2709026 there may be a few false teachers today but it seems like with every new move of god there are going to be those who will say it is demonic because it is somewhat different frankly i welcome new moves of god
2709027 i do believe that what many call a false teacher is not what a false teacher actually is many say a person is a false teacher if he or she teaches something they dont agree with
2709028 before accepting any ministry leader much prayer fasting and consideration must be given to the candidate
2709029 it all depends on the situation why they were divorced the other party may be to blame so if the leader is the innocent party why not allow them to lead a ministry
2709030 yes god hates divorce but the law of forgiveness heals not to let people be leaders who have experienced divorce in the past is hurtful legalism
2709031 absolutely no because god is so definite in his word that he hates divorce if divorced men or women become ministers how can they preach about having healthy families and healthy relationships when their own lives do not set good examples
2709032 allowing divorced christians to be ministry leaders doesnt say much to our younger generation my next question is how many times can a person be divorced and still be a leader in the church two three or four times
2709033 when you are a leader you lead by example people look up to you and take note of what you do or say but we can not judge only god knows and if god can forgive why cant we we are not greater that god
2709034 healthcare coverage is an important part of the american lifestyle
2709035 a society of equals with equal rights to the best healthcare the country can afford it
2709036 access to basic health care is a human right not a luxury only for the wealthy
2709037 if we can spend billions on an un justified war against people who had absolutely nothing to do with the attacks of september 11th then our countrys lawmakers can give each and every citizen universal healthcare we deserve it
2709038 americans only need access to lower cost insurance plans small business should get low cost opportunities to provide health insurance to the owners and their employees
2709039 the poor can already get health insurance the middle class should have a cheaper options
2709040 because as christians we should depend on god not government for all our needs
2709041 i am not sure as i dont feel that there will be equality for all or that this would improve the quality of care
2709042 i am not sure whether we should have universal healthcare i worry about trying to get into a doctor and having to pay for everyone else who does not have healthcare
2709043 how would this affect our taxes i mean who would be paying for this universal coverage
2709044 believers seem to be split down the middle on the death penalty taking a life as punishment for murder is a sensitive issue
2709045 an eye for an eye people like scott peterson have no conscience for what they do lacy and connor lost their life should i say more death is the only punishment that fits a horrendous crime
2709046 if a person kills another intentionally he should lose his own life i believe it would be a greater deterrent to others who so freely kill because they can get away with very little sentencing
2709047 whoso sheddeth mans blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of god made he man
2709048 look at matthew 5 38 45 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also ye have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but i say unto you love your enemies
2709049 i am ambivalent because of false convictions that are later revealed by dna testing i would more readily consent to life imprisonment without parole proof of innocence does no good after youre dead
2709050 we cant look back to the old testament to make a decision because were not under that now i just know that i wouldnt want to be the one to decide but something needs to be done with those who murder and maim people
2709051 nearly 90 of believers polled not only support israel but also view the nation as
2709052 and i will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed
2709053 i believe what god said about the blessings or curses of israel coming upon us i pray that this nation does not lose sight of that or we are in big trouble i love the nation of israel because they gave us the prophets the word of god and most of all our messiah god said pray for the peace of jerusalem and that is what we need to do it was not a suggestion but a mandate
2709054 first as a christian i should always support right against wrong
2709055 i know of some of the atrocities the israelis have committed against palestinians no i dont support israel
2709056 i do not support the modern day politics of the israeli government i do not support war but i support the word of god that says jesus the son of god will be returning there very very shortly to set up a thousand year kingdom of righteousness without israel salvation would not be available to us today
2709057 only time will tell the people must go to the polls to choose
2709058 he is the best person for the job and he is the only one who will be able to get votes across party lines
2709059 america is not ready to vote into office anything but a white male president that leaves out hillary and obama
2709060 he is a crook a liar a democrat at heart wishy washy not a fit republican candidate
2709061 a vote for mccain is an endorsement for more bush politics people want change from the current administration and bush has just been awful for this country
2709062 he wont win because it is time for a change and the republicans know that is really what the people want but they dont care about representing the people
2709063 only god knows and he will allow a person to be elected that he has a plan for
2709064 i dont know but i will certainly be on my knees praying about it before and after i visit the polls
2709065 it seems like everybody in the country hates bush and the republicans but just as many seem to hate hillary i would choose obama to win except i dont know if he will because he is a minority and he has limited political experience
2709066 over half of the believers we polled are opposed to obama selecting hillary clinton as his running mate
2709067 can you imagine obama having to deal with both bill and hillary i cannot even contemplate it we have had them for eight years and that is enough one does not come without the other
2709068 if a person is losing and starts using deceitful dirty tactics lying and causing division it is a clear sign that they will do whatever it takes to achieve a personal goal with very little loyalty a wolf is a wolf even if it changes from a shirt into sheeps clothing
2709069 together they could be an unbeatable team they both have good ideas about how to save our country from ruin and further destruction up to now our leader has made a shambles of things and the people are paying for his mistakes we need leadership to counteract that
2709070 a clinton obama ticket speaks volumes and demonstrates a spirit of unity in the democratic party
2709071 a marriage and commitment of the sexes and races with an african american male and a white female at the helm will make americans proud and respected
2709072 we cant depend on our wisdom and knowledge its better to ask god in prayer to give obama his wisdom to make a decision only god will make the right choice for him
2709073 more than we already have moral collapse the wrath of god is bearing down on our nation for its acceptance of whorehouse marriages and divorce abortion and for being a nation that practices and defends sin lies habitually and has chosen to sear its conscience
2709074 we were blessed with prosperity when we honored and put god first but that is gone now and so is gods divine protection
2709075 god promises in his word that we would never see the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging for bread hey guys we have to trust god if we pray and stick together god will save america right
2709076 only god knows for sure he can have this nation destroyed if he wants to but he might give america another chance but its unlikely because of abortion gay marriage and many more vices which are against god
2709077 god will uphold the nation for the sake of true believers although the usa has many bad elements there are millions who live a godly life god will honor them and not permit disaster to befall them or their lovely country
2709078 this country has experienced times of economic shifts before we survived and we will survive again we need to stop going after the bigger better and more costly and return to the simple
2709079 nearly all of those polled firmly believe that christians can be delivered from alcoholism through faith in god
2709080 because is a spirit the spirit of god can expel it if the recipient is willing to receive deliverance alcohol has to bow to the name of jesus and the blood of jesus can wash away any sin praise his name
2709081 i was an alcoholic from the age of 14 years but now i serve the lord i accepted the lord in 1986 at the age of 26 and i know the lord is able to break the bondage of alcoholism
2709082 on one hand god can heal anything but on the other hand christians usually work through a substance abuse program to overcome addictions rather than cure them if someone was totally cured of an addiction they wouldnt have to attend such groups for the rest of their life to stay clean
2709083 my first husband gave his life to the lord but died drunk he was spirit filled and i believe he tried to quit drinking
2709084 a christian cant be healed from alcohol addiction because a christian cannot be addicted to alcohol christians have eternal life which is far superior to any addiction here on earth
2709085 an alcohol addiction is a mental disease which takes a toll on the individual although an alcoholic can achieve sobriety with the help of medication and support groups they can always fall off the wagon an alcoholic is always an alcoholic
2709086 the people of this nation are torn between the political causes and effects of the war it is no different in the christian community
2709087 the war in iraq was about weapons of mass destruction not oil
2709088 i am shocked that this is even a question that is still asked president bush has never to my knowledge ever mentioned we were there for the oil
2709089 george bush was tricked and doesnt know how to discern the voice of god
2709090 i think it was there is no evidence of massive destruction weapons and that was the excuse for invasion in the first place
2709091 oil is vital for development therefore industrial giants would like control of oil supplies or possibly bush seniors son trying to out do his dad
2709092 yes amp no i think sadam hussein needed to be caught but after that the us should have gotten out it seems that president bush is about oil as former president bush taxation on gas slowed the economy in the 1990s now they have raised the prices to record levels
2709093 because the bible confirmed that at the end time many strange things will be happening nations will raise against nations
2709094 ne rappelle que trop dautres conflits r cents ayant d chir notre continent notamment dans les balkans

2709104 in a 2007 survey of large retailers 88 of respondents noted that email marketing had
2709105 i go to tonys on the pier for dinner and you always take it for granted its going to be there i think its just a shame
2709106 were thinking someone either took it for the sake of vandalism or for its value to have it smelted down
2709107 wow thats been there forever everybody recognizes it thats too bad it was there so long and it kind of reflects everything about the surfing culture
2709108 still love this place but some discussion w my boyfriend has revealed that i may have given
2709109 the modern english word hell is derived from old english hel helle about 725 ad and ultimately from proto germanic halja meaning one who covers up or hides something
2709110 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2709111 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2709112 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2709113 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2709114 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2709115 we cannot live for ourselves alone our lives are connected by a thousand invisible threads and along these sympathetic fibers our actions run as causes and return to us as results
2709116 you are missing an opportunity to help stop the bad guys
2709117 well sure my nigel says does that but he doesnt mean any harm by it
2709118 one of the first things we discover in these groups is that personal problems are political problems
2709119 women dont like nice guys they only want good looking assholes
2709120 by the way im also hugely concerned with the problem of y and ive written about it here if you would like to discuss it
2709121 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2709122 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2709123 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2709124 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2709125 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2709126 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2709127 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2709128 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2709129 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2709130 who are open to doing something on the production side
2709131 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2709132 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2709133 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2709134 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2709135 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2709136 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2709137 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2709138 post for someone pouting about their questions not being answered ive noticed a couple of people have blogroll links to the faq roundup rather than just the ff101 front page and i think thats an excellent idea as thats the proper core of the blog
2709139 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2709140 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2709141 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2709142 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2709143 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2709144 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2709145 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2709146 she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me
2709147 honey when i die and you want the closest thing to nonis desserts you go to stellas
2709148 without a doubt this is one of the best places to see music in the city
2709149 okay thanks i will have alittle and some of your fryes
2709150 lots of diversity two different floors lots of room to dance security was very friendly and the staff is awesome
2709151 there are people who spend their money on services and there are people who spend their money on tangible items
2709152 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
2709153 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2709154 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2709155 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
2709156 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2709157 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2709158 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2709159 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2709160 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2709161 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2709162 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe

2709164 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2709165 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2709166 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2709167 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2709168 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2709169 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2709170 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2709171 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2709172 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2709173 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2709174 hello taza my old friend ive come to eat from you again
2709175 thats why the cd player is messed up you know people playing bad cds on it i told you to throw these away
2709176 quoting carlos a we came here for our buddys 30th birthday bash and had a great time

2709190 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2709191 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2709192 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2709193 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2709194 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2709195 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2709196 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
2709197 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2709198 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2709199 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2709200 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2709201 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2709202 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2709203 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2709204 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2709205 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2709206 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2709207 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2709208 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2709209 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2709210 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2709211 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2709212 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2709213 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2709214 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2709215 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2709216 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2709217 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2709218 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2709219 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2709220 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2709221 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

2709257 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2709258 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2709259 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

2709261 ich habe heute f r trixi gearbeitet wie sie es schon so oft f r mich getan hat in verona hat es umgekehrt geklappt als ich den titel holte heute eben nicht
2709262 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2709263 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2709264 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2709265 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2709266 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2709297 we have left practically all of south ossetia as an expression of good will and our willingness to stop military confrontation
2709298 according to verified and reliable information at our disposal during the next few hours russian armed forces plan to launch an attack in the direction of the city of zugdidi
2709299 we are not taking any territory which would be laying outside of south ossetia we have not done that
2709300 and the second thing of course we are not targeting any civilians if there are civilian casualties which you cannot rule out this is of course deeply regrettable there is no fighting there have been some reports of bombings outside of territory of south ossetia and if there were some they were in the context of support of the peacemaking operation and because there is some georgian military activity which is supported from outside of south ossetia

2709309 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
2709310 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
2709311 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
2709312 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
2709313 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
2709314 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
2709315 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
2709316 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
2709317 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
2709318 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
2709319 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
2709320 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
2709321 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
2709322 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
2709323 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
2709324 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
2709325 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
2709326 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
2709327 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
2709328 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

2709348 yours looked like a pile of cake with bits of rock stuck in it nothing more and then the rest of the stuff thrown on it nothing else

2709363 new pricing policy we have now changed our pricing policy to offer all inclsive pricing what that means is that fares are no longer displayed without including any surcharges airport charges or taxes these amounts are now all included in the fare why have we done this we have decided to price this way now because we believe it is a simpler system and is in line with our overall corporate philosophy of keeping everything as simple as possible this change makes it much easier for us to manage our fares and improves communications with customers with the cost of fuel at an all time high we also thought that the time had come to stop treating the fuel surcharge and the fare as seperate costs high fuel prices are now a fact of life and we must all learn to live with them a fuel surcharge is meant for a short term spike in prices not a fundamental shift in the economic landscape

2709409 our season starts on sunday were going into it certainly raring to go and hopefully will continue throughout the season on a good run
2709410 football is a lot about confidence its all mental and going into that game obviously we want to win
2709411 its a great occasion for the fans and everyone involved if we win that game everyones buzzing going into the chelsea game were very confident and i think that will help were looking forward to it
2709412 i always believe the best ive played is under him
2709413 i respond to that well hes a good manager and knows how to play the game from my personal point of view he brings the best out of me and is why i came back here
2709414 if you speak to a lot of the players theyll say the same thing
2709415 he seems to get the best out of his players as he understands them and i think thats really important
2709416 i have been on his crouchs case all summer and now hes here everyone is looking forward to it its going to be good
2709417 luck wasnt on our side we played well against korea but lost we were definitely the better team today but once again we didnt get anything out of the game we just arent having any luck at the moment but thats football sometimes you win sometimes you dont so ill take the defeat sportingly
2709418 we should have won today but since we didnt now know that we have to win our next match japan which were very capable off
2709419 i blame my self for the draw i had two clear chances to have scored but i didnt i hope to get it right on sunday
2709420 it was clear that our boys showed courage and firmness in the game they were confident and calm and never showed signs of giving in to the dutch
2709421 i have immense confidence in them as they go up against japan on sunday and victory in that game will then set us up for a fine finish against the americans in group b
2709422 before the match coach siasia told us to play for each other fight for all balls and dont lose concentration and that he trusts us to do the job
2709423 we had to play a determined game because we did not want to let down that trust
2709424 we are happy with the result although we felt we can do more but dont forget it was our first game against a quality opponent
2709425 after the game the coach said well done and keep focused we were very happy with that
2709426 it is not easy to keep out a 20 million euro player so i think i did a good job
2709427 this game is very very important to us because we dont want to put our destiny in another teams hands
2709428 we respect all teams here but we dont have a choice than to go out there on sunday and come back with 3 points against the japanese
2709429 any team can beat any team and we know they lost against the usa so they will be fighting hard but we also drew against holland which means we are going to fight harder

2709444 in these very difficult times for the entire banking industry we think three things are most important liquidity capital and returning to profitability the asset transactions we announced two weeks ago brought in substantial liquidity removing these assets from our balance sheet in july will provide meaningful support to our capital ratios keeping us above the regulatory standards for a well capitalized bank while the losses we will book in 2008 from these asset sales and exit costs are large the restructuring will allow us to return to profitability in 2009
2709445 through asset sales and significantly reducing our exposure to home equity credit losses management and the board are re focusing the corporation on our core services to small business and local branch based customers
2709446 with the remaining home equity portfolio in run off mode we have capped our exposure to the national home equity industry while we exit this business
2709447 we believe we can return to profitability in 2009 by simplifying our business returning to the principles that have driven our success for the past 137 years serving small businesses and consumers in our branch communities and our franchisee customers nationally

2709485 think of the ways in which i hurt you more than anyone else has ever hurt you
2709486 people have hurt me more youre just the most recent
2709487 the greatest punishment was the lack of communication with my wife and my people
2709488 sometimes the worst moment is when you wake up so many questions flood your mind will i be here again tonight will i go home today every day seems like a month
2709489 i had never slept in the same bed as a man but i had no choice
2709490 my mind flooded with thoughts on our fate i prayed to god that we would remain unhurt i tried to remain calm hoping that all the militants wanted was to swindle the company by asking for a handsome ransom but not hurt us
2709491 i admit i was agitated at first wondering what the next step will be i had a feeling deep down that everything would be okay that it would be a matter time
2709492 the greatest punishment was the lack of communication with my wife and my people however they did not mistreat us at all
2709493 its painful not to call your loved ones but i felt it would be harder for them if i lied and said i was sick and dying i wasnt in good health but i wasnt in a bad shape either
2709494 i could hardly stand still for 10 minutes its a battle with boredom the militant commander had assured us we need not worry and at least that was a consoling thought
2709495 asif and i shared a lot of stories about our families and work what else could we do probably wed repeat the same story 10 times we had to kill the time somehow
2709496 i never cried its hard for me to cry it would have to be something really huge before i can shed tears
2709497 questions raced through my mind would i leave the place in one piece would i ever enjoy my kids like i used to do my family in malta know anything
2709498 i barely slept a wink that night i was not happy i felt there was something going on which i couldnt read i spent the night trying to fathom why we had been moved so suddenly
2709499 all i could see through the pillow cases were shadows and big guys coming towards us i was hoping we would get out of there safely and the rescue operation would not be botched
2709500 they may have exchanged something we do not know however the figure was never anything like that 5 5 million there was a demand yes but nowhere near that
2709501 i think they started by making a high demand but kept coming down and eventually settled for much less at the end of the day because we behaved i think they went as low as they could but theres no figure
2709502 my main objective was to get home to hug my wife and sons
2709503 i have never witnessed such compassion from a nation i was touched and very grateful that they sent a delegation to nigeria for just one man it was very special
2709504 i jumped out the car and my wife came and whisked me in the air hugging me and constantly asking is that you in disbelief that i was back

2709533 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2709534 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2709535 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2709536 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2709537 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2709540 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2709541 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2709542 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2709543 thats the same thing i was going to say do

2709632 we played really well that game we knew we had to play extremely well ucla made quite a run at the end of the season
2709633 i actually had to get an iv before the game i was sick with the flu and had lost some weight but i was able to hit a couple of big shots in the second half near the end we had a turnover or two i remember one possession we didnt even get a shot off that definitely hurt us
2709634 i think we called a timeout when we were up by one with 4
2709635 our team was devastated i think we were in shock initially as the tournament progressed and ucla kept marching on to the national title you find yourself saying what if you always go back and think how we could have done things differently ive thought about 17 000 different scenarios
2709636 i was actually rooting for arkansas after we lost they had beaten us by 52 points during the previous season that tigers team reached the elite eight and i wanted to see arkansas win two in a row
2709637 ive never sat and watched the whole game obviously ive seen replays of the shot ive played against charles obannon and toby bailey both starters on that 1994 95 ucla team during my professional career i dont think ive seen tyus though they had a great team and a lot of great players but you see a lot of great teams need a lucky bounce to win six games in a row thats just part of the deal it seems like all the teams that win it all have at least one tough game they all need a little luck on their side

2709709 we are enforcing the law after the ultimatum given last august 7 thursday lapsed
2709710 these are adjoining towns and because they are playing cat and mouse with government forces where they will leave one area and then return the situation is very fluid even as we speak the situation may have changed
2709711 it is against a group that defies the rule of law and continues to neglect the decision of the grp government of the republic of the philippines and milf leadership to vacate unlawfully occupied areas
2709712 their military justification was the milf there was not following the orders to reposition but they have been following since saturday they were already repositioning
2709713 i went to the 105th base command and they were amenable to the agreement to reposition their only concern was there should be strong measures in place before they leave to prevent the salvaging summary execution of our civilian members who will be left in the areas

2709791 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2709792 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2709793 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2709794 dear ones you are entering a time of ever accelerating energies and frequencies as you all move closer to the 2012
2709795 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2709796 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2709797 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2709798 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2709799 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2709802 seamus built up dundrum to what it is today and he also had a massive influence on the luas project and transport infrastructure in general across dublin and the rest of the country
2709803 in fact seamuss resting place in st naghis cemetery near his home in dundrum is fittingly overlooked by the bridge
2709804 seamus was a doer and was never afraid to roll up his sleeves
