9300198 she has been there and made the choice she made the choice for life
9300199 she was faced with a decision of having an abortion and she decided she was going to be there for him it shows a lot about her character
9300200 it is a combination of enthusiasm for john mccain and the prospect of an obama administration that is to say the least sobering
9300201 she is a very gutsy young woman willing to take on special interests and corruption even when it was in her own party
9300202 if they want to put a spotlight on sarah palins experience it will turn into a mirror for obama
9300203 we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9300204 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9300205 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9300206 intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9300207 its the same charge used against the chicago eight in 1968 and that was purely a politically motivated prosecution
9300208 this isnt about protecting delegates this is about a preemptive strike
9300209 his ambition to meet the standard of his famous father might have collided with his appreciation for the implausibility of the accomplishment
9300210 that i was supposed to have a live in father i was too young to know that i needed a race
9300211 they couldnt stop that ticking sound the sound of certain emptiness
9300212 i would go off in a mad frenzy and then suddenly crash to the floor unconscious
9300213 the president is highly unpopular there doesnt seem to be much excitement around the candidate and theres a real fear of being tagged with the republican label and being seen with george bush
9300214 if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
9300215 ruby red platform heels with a pink french style pedicure
9300216 the truth is no one knows whether sarah palin could be a competent president which shows how highly political and potentially reckless this choice is
9300217 shes got a great story she seems to have a wonderful engaging personality and the fact that she got elected governor of alaska i think shows shes got real political skills
9300218 i think that ultimately she subscribes to the same economic theories and foreign policy theories as john mccain does i think those are the wrong theories for this country i dont think that john mccain is offering something that can help middle class families on paying the bills sending their kids to college and getting healthcare and i dont get the sense that the addition of the vice presidential choice is going to change that
9300219 obviously this is a very serious situation it is a potentially very powerful storm
9300220 behold to obey is better than sacrifice and to heed than the fat of rams
9300221 is it the party in government or their head office outside government
9300222 there have been attacks and manipulation of the scorpions the public broadcaster and the judiciary
9300223 the judges of the constitutional court have been dubbed as a bunch of counter revolutionaries this campaign is characterised by war talk with the clear intention of blackmailing the courts the government and the country with the message you dare to charge us and we will cause havoc
9300224 the people who are arguing about a deal fail to acknowledge that this person claims to be innocent
9300225 it will be alright in the end because the love of god conquers all
9300226 they have all resolved as they did back on thursday to return to work tomorrow commencing at first shift monday morning
9300227 we await to see the formal offer for an eba
9300228 it is true to say we reserved all our rights legally and while no final decisions have been taken we would clearly have acted in what we thought were in the best interests of the mastheads and of the business as the situation evolved
9300229 all four of those meetings have voted overwhelming to accept the proposed eba and that will need to be formalised by a full vote of members during the week
9300230 pending that everyone will be back to work tomorrow morning and it will be business as usual

9300242 maar hij heeft gezegd dat als ik zwanger zou zijn hij bij mij blijft
9300243 hij zei dat ik meer ben dan zo maar een one night stand hij zegt me cht leuk te vinden en me vaker te willen zien
9300244 hmm dat is cht niet iets dat tom zou zeggen
9300245 en daarom vind ik het ook zo raar dat hij dat zei
9300246 bill vertelde me gisteren dat hij tom nog bijna nooit zo close heeft gezien met een meisje
9300247 jeweetwel meestal zijn toms vriendinnetjes na een nacht weer weg en praat hij niet meer over ze
9300248 sie haben schon das ganze wochenende einen vertr umten blick in den augen das haben sie ja oft aber jetzt ist es doch etwas anderes

9300312 men are accustomed to mixing which made women seek behaviours that disagree with their nature the more the mixing the greater is the number of the illegitimate children the consequences are clear to all so fathers do not get tempted by money and stop sending your daughters to work at laboratories and teach them to stay away from men statistical data shows that adultery becomes higher and is aggravated where the mixture between the men and the women increases cant you realize that the majority of illegitimate children are to women who work in laboratories or who work as house maids where they are exposed to mens gazes had there been no doctors to administer abortion pills and medicines there would have seen quadruples of these figures it has become sordid to see men in our country refuse to marry the inexperienced girls meaning those girls who have children from adultery so that they can benefit from them how much this woman suffered from the bitterness of the life
9300313 if our girls work in houses as servants or maids then it is better than working at laboratories where the girl becomes pollutant by tubercles that take the splendour of her life forever

9300495 go ahead and climb all over the 117 000 car while we go on a test drive
9300496 do not be afraid of them because by this time tomorrow i will hand all of them over to israel slain you are to hamstring their horses and burn their chariots
9300497 number 54s on a roster of 53 to improve the depth of the roster the bottom half of this team might be 64s on most other squads look for the dolphins to be very busy tomorrow
9300498 decided to hand out bags and ask our guests to help us
9300499 when you have to clear 110 000 people and clean up in 12 hours for another race it is nearly impossible to manage recycling also
9300500 we asked race fans to help and they have really embraced it
9300501 we know people dont want to get up and miss anything looking for a trash can
9300502 but they have been really eager to recycle they want to help
9300503 see that you despise not one of these little ones
9300504 i have not come to deny the law but to fulfill it
9300505 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
9300506 the sexual exploitation of slaves that we know from the american and mexican experience
9300507 youll have people standing in your driveway at 6 oclock
9300508 well that college fund of yours is off and running
9300509 yes we can move off that price a little instead of a quarter well sell it to you for 30 cents
9300510 you could have gotten 100 maybe 125 for that refrigerator
9300511 dad you know theres no way some of this stuff is going to sell dont you
9300512 you could put a price tag on a dried turd on a stick and it would sell
9300513 maybe we should call this a crap sale just what is the going rate for a dried turd on a stick
9300514 is a quarter for a 20 shirt too rich for your blood
9300515 its a social thing now like once a week and if i do i dont sit down with plans to get absolutely belligerent i thought when i turned 21 i would be going out and doing the same stuff i did before but i didnt
9300516 i do not think the drinking age should be lowered because no 18 year old i know would be responsible enough
9300517 if anything it makes people curious kids hear alcohol is terrible but they know their friends are doing it and they know their parents are doing it and yet theyre told not to touch the stuff until they turn 21
9300518 its not a proposal to lower the drinking age and the 129 who have signed are not advocating lowering the drinking age but they think the issue needs to be addressed and theyre calling on the public and lawmakers to consider other possibilities
9300519 i really dont think that lowering the drinking age would solve the problem
9300520 i dont know that it would add to the problem but i dont know that it would solve it either
9300521 i kinda hate it when you hear people say that it seems unfair that a person can serve their country at age 18 but theyre not old enough to buy a beer
9300522 because there is some truth to that i guess but when you have more people buying alcohol youre going to have more problems all the way around
9300523 to lawmakers the 21 year old drinking age is bad social policy and terrible law
9300524 no college president will say that drinking has become less of a problem in the years since the age was raised would we expect a student who has been denied access to oil paint to graduate with an ability to paint a portrait in oil colleges should be given the chance to educate students who in all other respects are adults in the appropriate use of alcohol within campus boundaries and out in the open
9300525 this has nothing to do with drunken driving if it did wed raise the driving age to 21
9300526 thats all well and good but once you have someone starting to consume alcohol they start forgetting their education
9300527 after a few drinks you start to lose your judgment
9300528 i look at it like when i get older and have kids do i want them to purchase alcohol at 18 no i dont
9300529 im not gonna be immature and say that students dont do that because its a part of college
9300530 but i dont really agree with that ruling because i dont even think they are that much more responsible at 21 than they are at 18 i do agree about having more knowledge but lowering it wouldnt solve the problem of binge drinking
9300531 theres probably going to be 40 000 people inside the building were especially looking forward to president bush and his wife speaking
9300532 i think things have changed for the better under bush
9300533 the war that situation has improved and the price of fuel its gone down
9300534 we just got back from ireland the cab driver was saying he wished gas was as cheap there as it is in america when you convert euros and liters into dollars and gallons theyre paying 10 25 a gallon
9300535 no mccain was not my first choice but i think the party is nominating him for a specific purpose to win a war
9300536 i know the election is still a tossup in the swing states but i really think americans are looking for stability and john mccain is about protecting the people
9300537 listening to the speakers at the convention will be great but getting to do things like this its an unbelievable opportunity
9300538 cappettos search for those surviving veterans has been relentless in five years hes interviewed almost 600 combat veterans assembling one of the largest oral histories ever recorded of americans at war
9300539 and anybody that i interview has a good chance of ending up on public television
9300540 i named this series lest they be forgotten because this generation of veterans sacrificed so much but asked so little
9300541 what has been missing is to hear the story of their patriotism sacrifice and love of country in their own words i purposefully sought to document and honor their remembrances and memories without editorial comment
9300542 is that after people watch my films theyll come away with a greater appreciation for all veterans and the freedoms we have in our country
9300543 but thats every weekend thats how much we drink every time we go out
9300544 ive been a carpenter all of my life so it just fits right in
9300545 i think its a good opportunity for families to come together and work on something as a family
9300546 blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of god
9300547 i did not come to bring peace but a sword
9300548 its already 6 00 am theres only three feet of snow on the ground and why aint that amp arena open get your 5 butt into town and my amp parking spot better be shoveled you think im going to amp watch these amp kids all day
9300549 we loaned money on a 1 000 bill one time a person needed money it was something he had received from a parent and didnt want to get rid of because the parent wasnt around anymore but he needed money for car repairs
9300550 there was a gentleman who had purchased a wedding ring when he was in the service in world war ii he came back and had gotten his dear john letter so he put the ring in his safety deposit box he never did get married didnt have any relatives so he sold us the ring in the original box with the original papers it wasnt a pawn but it was an unusual situation where 60 years later we end up with a brand new ring

9300568 something out there beyond the furthest reaches of the known solar system is
9300569 a heavenly body possibly as large as the giant planet jupiter and possibly so close to earth that it would be part of this solar system has been found in the direction of the constellation orion by an orbiting telescope aboard the u s infrared astronomical satellite so mysterious is the object that astronomers do not know if it is a planet a giant comet a nearby protostar that never got hot enough to become a star a distant galaxy so young that it is still in the process of forming its first stars or a galaxy so shrouded in dust that none of the light cast by its stars ever gets through
9300570 the possibility is high that a yet unknown planet class celestial body measuring 30 percent to 70 percent of the earths mass exists in the outer edges of the solar system
9300571 if research is conducted on a wide scale the planet is likely to be discovered in less than 10 years

9300576 secretary of state condoleezza rice on tuesday urged israel to stop expanding settlements on disputed territory hours after a new report came out saying the jewish state has nearly doubled such activity in the past year
9300577 but theres no outcry from our impassioned conscientious leaders to that
9300578 rice is visiting israel and the palestinian territories in hopes of furthering the announced goal of brokering a mideast peace deal by years end
9300579 said senate president lyda green a mother of three who has sometimes sparred with palin politically
9300580 when i was five months pregnant there was absolutely no question that i was with child
9300581 i have no desire to leave my job at all as governor
9300582 we leave the decision to fly up to our customers and their medical advisers
9300583 governor palin was extremely pleasant to flight attendants and her stage of pregnancy was not apparent by observation as she didnt show any signs of distress
9300584 oh sure well sell you an ungodly overpriced bottle of rum now you just have to pay 600 markup on the mix
9300585 in such situations russian diplomats will have to leave georgia
9300586 we regret this step from the georgian side it will not assist our bilateral relations
9300587 would be very awkward to have a diplomatic relationship with russia when russia will be setting up diplomatic relations with south ossetia and abkhazia
9300588 no moral right to the role of mentor in matters of international relations and to judge the actions of other states
9300589 even during the cold war regardless of political or other circumstances the soviet union always promptly met its contractual obligations to deliver energy to europe and russia being a responsible and reliable partner will also uphold such principles
9300590 made the international situation much more tense the direct consequence being a forceful strengthening of natos military and political position and all that will be happening close to our borders
9300591 i think we will shortly be witness to a dramatic change of the east west policies
9300592 despite the apparent strength the nato naval group in the black sea is not battle worthy
9300593 if necessary a single missile salvo from the moskva missile cruiser and two or three missile boats would be enough to annihilate the entire group
9300594 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al qaeda the taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9300595 acknowledge again and explicitly that this nation remains engaged in an armed conflict with al taliban and associated organizations who have already proclaimed themselves at war with us and who are dedicated to the slaughter of americans
9300596 this seems like a final push by the administration before they go out the door
9300597 we have been at war with an unconventional enemy whose primary goal is to kill innocent americans
9300598 is trying to stir up again the politics of fear by reminding people of something they havent really forgotten that we are engaged in serious armed conflict with al
9300599 but the question is where is that conflict to be waged and by what means
9300600 as sept 11 2001 recedes into the past there are some people who have come to think of it as kind of a singular event and of there being nothing else out there
9300601 in a way we are the victims of our own success our own success being that another attack has been prevented
9300602 reaffirm that for the duration of the conflict the united states may detain as enemy combatants those who have engaged in hostilities or purposefully supported al cia da the taliban and associated organizations
9300603 i dont want to face another situation where we had the sept 14 resolution and then attorney general gonzales claimed that that was authorization to violate fisa
9300604 i do not believe that we are in a state of war whatsoever
9300605 we have an odious opponent that the criminal justice system is able to identify and indict and convict theyre not a goliath dont treat them that way
9300606 they were supposed to destroy them and they signed documents saying they destroyed them
9300607 greenspan saw his job as a cheerleader for people who were able to get rich fast sort of like a pilot fish for sharks
9300608 dollar hegemony enables the us to own indirectly but essentially the entire global economy by requiring its wealth to be denominated in fiat dollars that the us can print at will with little in the way of monetary penalties
9300609 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
9300610 in the three months from april to june banks posted their second worst earnings performance since 1991 earnings for the quarter totaled just 5 billion compared with 36 8 billion a year ago a decline of 86 5
9300611 financial institutions will have to pay off at least 787 billion in floating rate notes and other medium term obligations before the end of 2009
9300612 this is my skirt it is blue with a bow and has pockets its good to put money in the pockets
9300613 i dont want to go in there there may be zombies im not ready for that yet
9300614 we cannot allow perpetrators to remain among us if they do it to one dont worry it will come to your door as well if you know turn them in drop the dime on them
9300615 we need the cooperation of the people in this community
9300616 we need people to come forward and tell the police what they know about the crime thats going on around them criminals prey on fear they prey on silence
9300617 people have to work these and the people who are working them are saturated
9300618 let our treasonous elected officials know justice will be done i try to express myself and let people know i am one american that will not go down without a fight i will with my god given dying breath use that last movement to spit in the face of the lying treasonous corrupt public officials who are destroying the usa one of the greatest gifts god has given the world since he gave his son jesus christ to die for our sins
9300619 the undermining of the ideals the degeneration of the decent way of life and the fragmentation of the former general cohesion of western society are a long planned and progressively executed mission controlled by those few who have and wield the power behind the scenes to achieve their objective they supervise corruptible politicians of all political complexions and the judiciary to implement their agenda to stop their malfeasance their objective requires to be exposed they must be brought to justice for their crimes are legion and the evidence to the wrongdoing incontrovertible
9300620 it has come as another massive blow to us we have had to cancel
9300621 this is the not the first bump in the road we have had in fact it has been a total nightmare to try and keep this festival together with one problem after another this one has finally knocked us down and we are not getting back up from it

9300823 domestic abuse against men is such a taboo subject men who are suffering from it are embarrassed to broach it causing them to feel isolated and ultimately causing them to remain in their same vulnerable position patricks poetry does anything but its harrowing compelling and psychologically acute juxtaposing the cruelty of domestic abuse against the pleasure of a new relationship a technique which thoroughly engaged me as a reader and left me feeling utterly hopeful despite the distressing subject matter the theme is fascinating because of its virtual invisibility and it is handled adeptly with skill and sophistication the poems give the reader an insight into the painful effects of domestic abuse without having to resort to malice or sentimentality elsewhere patrick addresses the way children are taught at school in a poem entitled valley comprehensive he asks shouldnt education be about teaching children how not what to think the iraq war nationalism and the countryside alliance come under scrutiny material we have come to expect from a poet so rooted in welsh socialism but there are also a few surprises man kind dedicated to waris dirie former chanel model and humanitarian worker born into a nomadic tribe in somalia who aged five had her genitals hacked away and vagina sewn up by her mother and another local woman condemns female genital mutilation for cultural and religion reasons

9300874 most of the soldiers who had served in either the gulf or afghanistan were suffering from post traumatic stress
9300875 most of the soldiers who had served in either the gulf or afghanistan were suffering from post traumatic stress little support or counselling was available on discharge from the forces
9300876 virtually all became involved in heavy drinking or drug taking and in consequence involvement in violence offences sometimes domestically related happened routinely
9300877 the vast majority of the offending is drug or alcohol related violence there is no systematic availability of stress related counselling
9300878 had support services been available at the point of discharge and when personnel first came in touch with the criminal justice system custody could have been avoided probably in the majority of cases
9300879 a select few get into a vortex that drags them downwards
9300880 we believe more effort should be made to tackle the acceptance of heavy drinking that still occurs among sections of the armed forces to identify causes for alcohol misuse to help vulnerable personnel reduce their alcohol intake and to investigate the long term psychological health effects of alcohol over use among service personnel
9300881 the majority of people that leave the armed forces leave having had a life changing experience
9300882 some do find it difficult to adjust and feel isolated and lonely in some cases people will descend into alcohol or substance abuse lose their job and spiral into homelessness and eventually end up in jail military operations in recent years have placed the armed forces under increased pressures
9300883 robust systems are in place to treat and prevent ptsd and other stress disorders counselling is available to service personnel at all times and all troops receive pre and post deployment briefings to help recognise the signs of stress disorders
9300884 thats when i started to drink heavily everybody did it it was the norm
9300885 it took me a long time to realise i was suffering from ptsd and now i look back at the way that i used to be violent in the past and i really regret it

9300906 ad una riforma federalista che rischia di smantellare il diritto allistruzione a 60 anni dalla costituzione ha detto fioroni si ritorna ad una scuola che ciascuno pu avere a seconda di dove nasce e dei soldi che ha in tasca quando tremonti dice miglioreremo rapidamente gli apprendimenti credo che in realt pensi a questo io vedo lo spettro di uno smantellamento del diritto allistruzione
9300907 quel che mi preoccupa ha sottolineato lex ministro la sensazione di una strategia della distrazione che apre un dibattito rispetto alla scuola pubblica italiana e nasconde il tema pi preoccupante da un lato i tagli che mettono a repentaglio la presenza delle scuole nei comuni pi piccoli nei comuni montani dallaltro questa attenzione pervicace alla quota capitaria come applicazione del federalismo nellistruzione realizzare il federalismo in italia significa avere risorse aggiuntive da mettere in campo subito per consentire ad esempio ai nostri ragazzi del sud di essere protagonisti avendo strutture essenziali uguali a quelle del nord
9300908 con la quota capitaria di x euro forse si pu avere una scuola di qualit al centro di una grande metropoli ma non si pu avere nelle zone disagiate ha concluso non la pu avere il diversamente abile o il figlio dellimmigrato
9300909 si educa con le sanzioni che hanno funzione deterrente ma queste da sole non bastano ha detto berlinguer dal 96 al 2000 a capo dellistruzione perch i ragazzi rispettano le regole anche severe se le sentono proprie difficile imporle con la verga
9300910 istruzione ed educazione sono due facce della stessa medaglia sostiene lex ministro fondamentale capire che rigore e coinvolgimento devono andare di pari passo preferisco le sanzioni alternative che non sono lassismo ma punizione efficace ed condivisa
9300911 una scuola che ha unofferta didattica monocorde antica non si pu tornare al passato questo provvedimento conclude ha tutta laria di servire a tagliare posti di lavoro
9300912 la contrapposizione segue unuscita poco felice del ministro peraltro subito rettificata ma non mi pare di veder delinearsi alternative che mettano listruzione al centro dello sviluppo della societ italiana
9300913 magari fosse di due anni il ritardo che separa il sud dal nord nellistruzione in realt e un ritardo epocale accumulato grazie a unintera classe politica al sud le famiglie riescono a seguire il cammino dei figli fino alle elementari poi vanno in tilt nessuna riforma masi stata realizzata anche se nellopinione pubblica si fissata lidea che riforme ne siano state fatte a decine

9301010 chicas y maletas me parece muy buen t tulo para una comedia de mujeres abandonadas
9301011 pina el personaje que interpreta pen lope no se parece a carmen maura es m s un cruce entre la mar a barranco de mujeres y la audrey hepburn de sabrina se trata de una adaptaci n muy libre de mujeres y s repito el gazpacho pero lo resuelvo de otra manera
9301012 hay un director y una actriz una actriz que por fin cumple su sue o pero que le llega en un momento en el que los problemas que atraviesa le crean enormes dificultades para actuar y para ser graciosa est delgada demacrada pero tiene que ser chispeante el reto para ella es terrible en el peor momento posible tiene que resultar una gran actriz c mica
9301013 yo necesitaba una comedia ligera y divertida para ponerla al servicio del drama y pens que lo m s c modo era utilizar una de mis pel culas y hacer una versi n libre
9301014 en los ltimos a os mi cine ha girado en torno al mundo de los sentimientos se ha ido oscureciendo y por eso pens en chicas y maletas como en un regalo un capricho una posibilidad de volver atr s y como no creo que vuelva a hacer una pel cula pop entera echar una cana al aire
9301015 la mitad del atrezzo es m o yo quer a vivir en una casa discreta pero est claro que no puede ser
9301016 el director de chicas y maletas quiere hacer una comedia muy estilizada un pop mondrianesco destilado desde la mirada de los a os noventa
9301017 es curioso no s lo hemos rodado en el mismo estudio en el que rodamos mujeres sino tambi n en el mismo decorado de entonces ocupamos el mismo espacio el rodaje de mujeres fue dif cil y ste tampoco ha sido f cil todo es un poco de locos convertir la comedia en drama conseguir una interpretaci n que resulte pat tica en escenas propias de un vodevil hacer una pel cula en la que parece que nada funciona hacerlo mal a prop sito pero sin caer en la parodia pen lope y carmen machi pina y chon han superado el reto y al final todos nos re mos mucho ha sido una experiencia muy interesante para ellas y para m mismo y la verdad es que pese a todo nos hemos divertido tanto que hay m s chicas y maletas de lo previsto y hasta creo que har algunas modificaciones en el gui n para incluir alguna secuencia m s

9301019 ramadhan is the month in which the quran was revealed a guidance for mankind and clear proofs of the guidance and as a criterion al furqan
9301020 the prayer of repenters is due when the young camel can feel the suns heat early in the morning
9301021 o you who believe fasting is prescribed for you as it was prescribed for those before you that you may become pious
9301022 these are the limits set by allah so approach them not
9301023 every deed of the son of adam will be multiplied in rewards the good deed by ten of its like up to seven hundred times up to whatever allah wills except fasting it is for me and i will reward it he abandons his desire and his food for my sake
9301024 and people may see that a person is not eating in front of them but the fact that he is really abandoning his food and his desire for the sake of god is a thing that nobody can find out about and that is the essence of fasting
9301025 fasting is a shield and a secure fortress against the fire
9301026 whoever performed the night prayer during ramadhan out of belief and anticipating gods rewards will be forgiven his previous sins
9301027 whoever feeds a fasting person has the same reward as him except that the reward of the fasting person will not be diminished
9301028 fasting and reading the quran will intercede for the person fasting will say o lord i forbade him eating and drinking so let me intercede for him and the quran will say i deprived him from his night sleep so let me intercede for him
9301029 the prophet peace be upon him was the most generous among people and he was more generous during the month of ramadhan
9301030 the prophet peace be upon him used to perforrn itikaf during the last ten days of ramadhan
9301031 and when my slaves ask you o muhammad concerning me then answer them i am indeed near to them i respond to the invocations of the supplicant when he calls on me
9301032 three invocations will be answered the invocation of the fasting person the invocation of the oppressed and the invocation of the traveler
9301033 when the last ten days come he would pray most of the night and wake his family and apply himself and tighten up his loincloth
9301034 the messenger of allah used to strive in the last days of ramadhan more than he did during the other days
9301035 fasting is not only abstaining from eating and drinking but abstaining from vain and obscene talk so if someone insulted you or wronged you say i am fasting
9301036 whoever does not abandon lying then allah does not need him to abandon his food and drink
9301037 this is a book which we have sent down to you full of blessings that they may ponder over its verses
9301038 those who read the quran in less than three days do not grasp its meaning
9301039 but when i say lets keep in touch i hope you know i mean i wish that youd grow up this is the first song for your mixtape its short just like your temper

9301059 la importancia de promover el trasporte p blico para acceder al concierto
9301060 por ello se sacaron a la venta m s de 3 000 tickets de tren de cercan as que ya se han vendido
9301061 con el ticket se podr coger cualquiera de los autobuses en un intervalo horario determinado y lo mismo ocurrir para la vuelta donde durante unas cuatro horas se podr coger otro autocar para volver
9301062 para promover que la gente por ejemplo acuda a cheste por la ma ana y desde all coja un autob s que le desplazar hasta el circuito y despu s de devuelva a la localidad valenciana
9301063 lo que sobre todo se quiere conseguir con todas estas medidas es el escalonamiento tanto en la llegada como en la salida de los asistentes al concierto de madonna para evitar el menor n mero de atascos y problemas en las carreteras
9301064 as intentamos lograr que no todo el mundo se vaya cuando acabe el concierto
9301065 tambi n es recomendable que si se va en coche se intente que vayan llenos para que se reduzca su n mero lo m ximo posible y que no se colapsen los accesos
9301066 lo que de verdad queremos es que cuando a las 22 00 horas la gira sticky amp sweet tour de madonna comience en el circuito de cheste todo el mundo est dentro
9301067 si el d a del concierto a n quedan entradas a la venta tambi n se podr n adquirir en la fnac pero nunca en el circuito ya que queremos evitar al m ximo las aglomeraciones
9301068 habr n unos 88 trailers por lo que no va a faltar el sonido y se oir con la misma calidad en cualquier punto del recinto

9301092 and it turns out that the role of the centrifugal acceleration mechanism is significant and may explain a large fraction of the parallel velocities observed at high altitude above the polar caps

9301112 the person who accepts the khilafat of only thirty years ignores its real object through his folly he does not know that
9301113 we indeed wrote in the book after the reminder that my righteous servants shall inherit the earth
9301114 given that god had explained by use of an analogy that he would raise khalifas in this ummah in the same manner as he raised khalifas after moses one should see what course did god follow after the death of moses did he send khalifas for only thirty years or did he extend this series for fourteen hundred years the grace of god upon our holy prophet may peace and the blessings of god be upon him was far greater than that which was upon moses how could it be that the series of successors of moses should be continued for fourteen hundred years but here the khilafat terminate after a mere thirty years
9301115 he will surely make them khalifa in the earth as he made khalifa from among those who were before them
9301116 al nur 56 means that muhammadiyya khilafat is similar to the khilafat of bani israel by all aspects
9301117 29 september 1905 before noon a man asked the question will a mujaddid come after you he the promised messiah replied what is wrong with a mujaddid coming after me the prophethood of moses had come to an end and that is why his chain of successors ended with jesus however the dispensation of the holy prophet muhammad will last till the day of judgment therefore mujaddids will arise in it till judgment day as long as the day of judgment withholds its destruction it does not matter that someone else should come we most certainly do not deny that good and righteous people will continue to come and then all of a sudden the day of judgment will come
9301118 for every age the conclusive proving of the case for islam takes place in a different sense and the mujaddid of the time comes with the powers faculties and qualities upon which depends the reformation of the prevalent evils god will ever continue to do this as long as he pleases so that signs of righteousness and reform remain in the world these matters are not without proof on the contrary repeated observations testify to them
9301119 another point is that the letter ra in the word alif lam ra shows that this word refers to the permanent institution of mujaddids and the sent ones which will continue till the day of judgment all these miraculous works and victories which took place at the hands of the mujaddids among the followers of the holy prophet muhammad after him and will continue till the day of judgment are really the achievements of the holy prophet
9301120 is it essential that a mujaddid comes in every century
9301121 29 september 1905 before noon a man asked the question
9301122 what is wrong with a mujaddid coming after me the prophethood of moses had come to an end and that is why his chain of successors ended with jesus however the dispensation of the holy prophet muhammad will last till the day of judgment therefore as long as the day of judgment withholds its destruction it does not matter that someone else should come we most certainly do not deny that good and righteous people will continue to come and then all of a sudden the day of judgment will come

9301371 noel literally just played it the night before it was recorded did a little one man band job played the drums the bass the guitar sung it and came back up the stairs
9301372 its really hearfelt theres a melancholy there and thats whats liams showing
9301373 the oldest song on the album originally demoed for heathen chemistry wouldnt have made the album but the bass is so heavy it forced its way onto the final cut
9301374 three chords one note krautpop the kind of song ive wanted to write for years
9301375 it was just a groove a bassline and noel was like thats the one write some words for it its a stream of consciousness and theres no guitars on it which is another thing i like as well
9301376 liam wanted it to sound like the who with ginger baker on drums playing while a fight was happening
9301377 it was written at an odd time in my life when my marriage had run its course i taught noel the guitar parts and then let him roll with it gem played bass on it i dont play on it at all i wanted to make sure that it sounded right in the control room where it was being played
9301378 the coral said to noel thats a top tune so noel said whats this and i said i havent got a clue it was an old liam song i demoed with him around 2004 or 2005 and couldnt remember

9301420 before leaving the altar the concelebrants make a profound bow to the altar for his part the principal celebrant along with the deacon venerates the altar with a kiss in the usual way
9301421 if a long recessional hymn is being sung the concelebrants may come before the altar in twos and bow or genuflect in pairs
9301422 on arriving in the sacristy if there is room for them the concelebrants should line up facing the crucifix or image or the processional cross held by the cross bearer and so as to allow the principal celebrant to come to the center of the room all make the customary reverence together and then proceed quietly to the designated place or vesting room where each concelebrant un vests in a spirit of recollection and peace
9301423 to me it seems that one is either a celebrant or not this is particularly annoying in vesture to distinguish between the celebrants seems to confuse the idea of a hierarchical liturgy i understand the practicality of the distinction but it seems that with the frequency of concelebration concelebrants seem like secondary ministers not equal in dignity to the celebrant the bishop being a different matter altogether is understood
9301424 does the rule of wearing a proper vestment alb chasuble and stole during concelebration apply to a mass celebrated at a private chapel of the residence of priests will it be proper for a priest just to participate in the mass without concelebrating

9301429 bersiaplah dan berhias dirilah untuk menyambut para hambaku mereka hampir beristirahat dari kelelahan dunia menuju tempat tinggalku dan rahmatku kelima bila penghujung bulan ramadhan tiba allah berkenan mengampuni dosa mereka semua
9301430 tidak tidakkah kau lihat para pekerja yang mengerjakan tugasnya dengan baik bila mereka telah selesai bekerja maka dipenuhilah gaji mereka

9301441 the maternal center of mass shifts forward about three to five centimeters during pregnancy so that its no longer beautifully aligned with the hips and feet
9301442 its a nifty little package of adaptations we see it in modern humans but its also apparent from the little bit of vertebral anatomy we see in earlier hominids
9301443 it seems part and parcel of the challenges of bipedalism walking on two feet rather than four
9301444 women by and large make pregnancy look so easy but there are very few women who have experienced pregnancy who havent had some back pain
9301445 without these adaptations i think this back pain would be exceedingly worse i think these adaptations mediate some of the intensity of back pain
9301446 i think the reason why pregnant women dont tip over is that the placenta produces relaxin a hormone released in pregnancy that spreads your pelvis making it wider and giving you a wider stance thats why you walk like a duck when youre pregnant

9301453 despite obamas impressive victories in february clintons comeback is based on sowing political seeds of doubt
9301454 in order to clinch the nomination he must anticipate the worst attacks ever
9301455 if these attacks are contrasts based on policy differences there is no need to stop the race or halt the debate
9301456 but if this is more division more diversion from the issues and more of the same politics of personal destruction chairman dean and other should be on standby
9301457 why is it that everyone has all of a sudden made barack obama the blackest black man on the planet malcolm x would be jealous of obama at this point
9301458 thanks for the joyful email like most of the other pro clinton emails i have now put them in a special folder called tales from the gutter stay positive and remember if she wins you will need obama supporters and donors so please stop throwing stones give her the support now and stop sending frivolous emails

9301460 oh yeah well we disagree with your view that the quran encourages the education of girls
9301461 when it comes to the problem of family disintegration we are like a deer in the headlights everyone is affected by the issue but were afraid to address it because we know none of us is perfect unfortunately that allows the problem to grow and the price tag keeps expanding its time we put more effort into enacting policies that support marriages and help families both survive and thrive

9301544 apabila seseorang melihat hilal ramadhan atau syawal apakah menjalankan ash shaum atau berhari raya dengan ruyahnya sendiri atau menjalankannya bersama kaum muslimin
9301545 shaumnya kalian adalah pada hari dimana kaum muslimin bershaum idul fitri kalian adalah pada hari kaum muslimin beridul fitri dan idul adha kalian adalah pada hari kaum muslimin beridul adha
9301546 sebagian ulama menafsirkan hadits ini bahwa maknanya adalah ash shaum dan hari raya bersama jamaah kaum muslimin dan mayoritas dari mereka
9301547 perkara inilah yang tepat dan sesuai dengan asy syariat yang bersifat selalu memberikan kemudahan ini yang diantara tujuan utamanya adalah menyatukan barisan kaum muslimin dan menjauhkan semua sebab sebab yang menimbulkan perpecahan diantara mereka dengan munculnya berbagai pendapat pribadi
9301548 anda mengkritik utsman sedangkan anda sendiri shalat empat rakaat yakni berma mum di belakang utsman
9301549 kaum muslimin berusaha hilal kemudian saya mengabarkan kepada nabi shalallahu alaihi wasallam bahwa saya melihatnya maka beliau menjalankan ash shaum dan memerintahkan kaum muslimin untuk bershaum
9301550 tidak diragukan lagi berdasarkan as sunnah hadits hadits yang sah serta kesepakatan para shahabat bahwasanya tidak boleh menyandarkan masuk dan keluarnya bulan ramadhan kepada hisab perbintangan sebagaimana hadits yang telah sah dari beliau rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wasallam yang diriwayatkan dalam ash shahihain al bukhari dan muslim beliau berkata
9301551 ash shaum tidak menjadi wajib hukumnya dengan berdasarkan ketentuan hisab falaki walaupun para pakar ilmu hisab telah menetapkan bahwa malam ini merupakan bagian dari ramadhan padahal kaum muslimin tidak berhasil melihat al hilal maka tidak boleh bershaum karena syariat islam mengaitkan hukum shiyam berdasarkan sesuatu yang bisa dicapai oleh indera manusia yaitu berdasarkan ruyatul hilal
9301552 bershaumlah kalian berdasarkan ruyatul hilal dan berharirayalah berdasarlan ruyatul hilal jika hilal terhalangi oleh mendung atau semisalnya maka genapkanlah bilangan hari bulan syaban menjadi 30 hari
9301553 janganlah kalian bershaum hingga kalian berhasil melihat hilal dan janganlah kalian berbuka beridul fitri hingga kalian berhasil melihat hilal
9301554 sesungguhnya kami adalah umat yang ummiy kami tidak dapat menulis dan tidak pula menghisab maka bershaum lah kalian berdasarkan ruyah al hilal dan berbukalah memasukui idul fithri berdasarkan ruyah al hilal
9301555 maksud kata al hisab dalam hadits ini adalah ilmu hisab perbintangan dan peredarannya mereka para shahabat dahulu tidak mengetahui tentang ilmu tersebut kecuali segelintir orang saja
9301556 jika terhalangi oleh mendung maka sempurnakan bilangan syaban menjadi tiga puluh hari

9301601 when we first went into afghanistan to overthrow the taliban we were actually welcomed by an overwhelming majority of afghans they did not see us as invaders as they saw the soviets
9301602 not a united force not a world oriented terrorist movement but a real afghan phenomenon
9301603 well if mccain is president and if his secretary of state is joe lieberman and his secretary of defense is rudolph giuliani we will be moving towards the world war iv that they have been both favoring and predicting
9301604 so it depends on who are the principal officers if its richard armitage or if it were to be brent scowcroft i think it would be very different
9301605 i think sen chuck hagel i would like to see a bipartisan cabinet i think we need one very badly and we did well in the cold war when we had one i would say hagel and sen dick lugar would be very good republicans for obama
9301606 keep secretary of defense bob gates in the job for a few months
9301607 i think there is a tendency because of the very complexity of the issues for solutions to become polarized and more extreme republicans move toward neocon ish formulas and democrats follow idealistically escapist formulas in either case you dont end up with the necessary mix of idealism and realism

9301682 semua pemain kami menjadi sangat bernilai karena cara bermain deco tim lain berusaha menjaga dia dengan satu atau dua pemain yang malah memberi kami pemain lain ruang gerak ekstra rekan setimnya memahami itu dan memberi kami kepercayaan diri untuk bermain lewat caranya

9301693 several kids and babies died in the fields because parents were fearful of sending them to head start
9301694 since early 2007 many of our programs started to notice that border patrol of immigration and customs enforcement vehicles were parked outside their centers and some were following buses picking up children
9301695 it could have happened if we believe there was an immigration violation afoot but its not our policy or practice i believe
9301696 generally our operations avoid actions at school settings however we will take into custody during these targeted operations anyone encountered who may be in the country illegally
9301697 we ask that ice enforcement and intimidation tactics near migrant and seasonal head start centers cease immediately
9301698 parents were fearful of going to the centers or letting their kids get on the bus and enrollment went down in some parts
9301699 since the head start program was started in 1965 we have never asked families if they are citizens and its never been a requirement

9301705 whether you voted for me or voted for barack the time is now to unite as a single party with a single purpose
9301706 to repent is to believe and to believe is to repent
9301707 we repent change our minds when we believe trust in rely upon jesus based on what he did for us on the cross and we are saved he then comes into our lives and changes us from the inside out turns us from our sins day after day but he doesnt begin that work of spiritual transforamtion until hes working from the inside philippians 2 12 13 and he doesnt get on the inside until we trust in him for our salvation ephesians 1 13 14
9301708 it is true that numerous bible verses speak of the promise of salvation with no mention of repentance
9301709 repentance toward god and faith toward our lord jesus christ
9301710 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth
9301711 he that covers his sins shall not prosper but whoso confesses and forsakes them repentance shall have mercy
9301712 repent and be converted that your sins may be blotted out
9301713 it is the responsibility of the district administration and the police to protect life and property of all opposition leaders and supporters in darjeeling hills

9301717 congress is interested to keep the gorkhaland movement in the highlight until the forthcoming lok sabha election once the election is over they will pack up the issue and forget it for another five years
9301718 avevamo proposto di simulare lo spegnimento della fiamma olimpica racconta la fonte cinese per poi mantenerla accesa fino alla fine delle paralimpiadi per dare un segno di continuit fra i due eventi
9301719 mantenere accesa la fiamma olimpica sottolinea lattivista che da anni si occupa di disabili nel paese avrebbe rappresentato un segnale forte per la comunit internazionale essa testimoniava lattenzione e la cura con la quale la cina segue le persone affette da handicap dando rilievo e interesse allevento sportivo a loro dedicato
9301720 purtroppo anche qui denuncia la fonte c molto su cui lavorare
9301721 in realt levento olimpico conclude lattivista era solo un pretesto per mostrare al mondo la potenza della cina contava solo che tutto filasse liscio e non ci fossero incidenti

9301728 mongols need laws and i will make them obey even if i have to kill half of them

9301730 sometimes as adults we forget what its like to be happy and all our activities are geared to perpetuating unhappiness when youre a kid you want to be happy so they did things to make themselves happy
9301731 its a world we better figure out because we cant ask our students to come into a classroom put those things aside and sit in a row and think were interesting were just not that interesting
9301732 its the place to do something fun and a little out of the box
9301733 its the biggest crowd and its what people are talking about i was fortunate to play and win in the audrey hepburn dress
9301734 right now it needs other things including more people living downtown and a downtown that is more livable
9301735 a convention center is not at top of the list personally i think it ought to be a little bit on the quiet side
9301736 this selection was complicated by the australia a team being in india in normal circumstances the additional player added to the australia squad would come from those selected for australia a
9301737 with only two one day internationals remaining in darwin and 12 fit players however its unlikely that any replacement player would play in either of these matches
9301738 given the importance of the australia a tour of india where players will have an opportunity to press for test selection in the upcoming series it was decided that a young emerging player should be added to the national team to gain experience
9301739 the nsp thought it was an ideal opportunity to reward moises for an outstanding stint at the cricket australia centre of excellence and emerging players tournament
9301740 simply organic a cookbook for sustainable seasonal and local ingredients

9301744 theres going to be a lot more options available to tyler students now
9301745 having the galleries and the concerts and more artistic opportunities available will be great for temple as well as the surrounding community
9301746 has in some ways isolated us a little bit from the rest of the art scene in philadelphia
9301747 its going to more accurately reflect the standards of the school
9301748 one thing we often hear here is that people dont understand contemporary art that it is too abstract
9301749 she has more staying power than anything ive seen to date
9301750 its exciting to see three big institutions in the triangle devote considerable resources to contemporary art
9301751 non u s carriers exclude more of their coach fares from frequent flier accumulation than u s carriers
9301752 i figured that it must have been a slow news week which is hard to believe considering the russians invaded georgia and the olympics were getting started
9301753 we had one arch out of more than 2 000 collapse
9301754 and while it was the 12th largest arch in the park theres many more that are better known than wall arch
9301755 we all want to get the trail open as soon as we can but we are talking about a very small percentage of the park being affected
9301756 we are open for business and there are still lots of arches to see both in this section of the park and others
9301757 jackson is very interesting sort of small towny yet very elegant in its own way
9301758 and the drive through the grand tetons on the way to the park is a great thing its just incredibly beautiful

9301762 it was absolutely stupendous i think for me the pinnacle of the day was when jimmy james was doing his finale and the fireworks went off overhead from curwen park
9301763 that was a truly spectacular moment the whole audience was bouncing and it just finished off the day perfectly it has put a mark down and set a stamp for the future
9301764 we always had great shows here and i think that today is one of them people can live together in a community and not meet but this kind of event brings them together
9301765 i hope it will get better and better as it goes on
9301766 it was awesome he put me in the boot while the car was on two wheels i was leaning out of the passenger seat when the car was on its side and waving out the window
9301767 i really enjoyed the day and i hope that its something that can be put on every year its absolutely great

9301788 will look to sarah palin as a fellow traveler with john mccain on the road to reform
9301789 she clearly has the judgment to be one of our nations most effective and popular governors
9301790 she is a tough executive who knows how to bring together democrats and republicans new jersey can identify with this ticket that really will reform washington

9301817 in the 1990s there will be millions of personal computers they will be the size of notebooks today have high resolution flat screen displays weigh less than 10 pounds lets call them dynabooks
9301818 the difficulty of adults to adjust to new ideas i dont mean really new ideas like computing but ideas new to the human race like science and how it uses mathematics or even slightly older ideas like reading and writing teaching the latter is still a struggle despite its relative antiquity and despite the fact that we know very well how to do it best and real mathematics and real science are not yet taught in elementary and even most high schools
9301819 students are learning how to micromanage an array of elements while simultaneously balancing short and long term goals
9301820 theyre completely high tech and they dont know a different way

9301828 i dont tell the state police how to write their reports
9301829 so its accurate to say then that matwiejczyk was choosing to disregard your study
9301830 if it was their intent to conceal the state police report it would be difficult to understand why matwiejczyk and wolfe would have freely discussed the existence of the report with other members of the ingham county prosecutors office and the family of ms kronenberg
9301831 theres no question something of this magnitude should have been brought to my attention
9301832 if the attorney general had believed that ms maloney was aware of that opinion i have no doubt they would have cited her too
9301833 thats one of the things i hope to find out from the attorney generals report and ill read the transcripts

9301852 to tell the truth we had over thirty matches and every one of them was different
9301853 i was always working out at the ymca but i never had any athletic goals in mind
9301854 he told me they made big money and id have my college money in no time
9301855 i had his leg tied in the ropes and i went for the knee drop but on the way down all of a sudden he moves his head and i clipped him with the top of my boots thats what severed the top of his ear
9301856 the promoter quinn tells me that i owe eric an apology
9301857 at first i wasnt too sure about becoming a vegetarian then i heard about these two runners roger bannister and john landy they were the first two men to break the four minute mile barrier it was at the british empire games which were run in british columbia roger bannister from england won in under four minutes and the little guy john landy from new zealand he was just behind by a foot so he ran under four minutes also they both broke the four minute barrier
9301858 and so i thought i better give it a shot overnight i became a vegetarian
9301859 in the beginning it was for athletic reasons but later i became more concerned about life itself i wont go too deeply into it but there is a religious part and meditative part of vegetarianism for me
9301860 after i made the change people asked me different questions about being a vegetarian such as
9301861 elephants theyre vegetarians they grow up big and strong and horses they have tremendous endurance and they are vegetarians but meat eaters like lions and tigers they have a short life span

9301940 el campo es lo que es y el rival tambi n as que no se tienen que buscar excusas tenemos que ir a ganar
9301941 complicado tendr que hacerse todo bien aunque no se ganar o perder la liga en funci n del resultado
9301942 muy contento con el equipo y con los fichajes que se han hecho
9301943 han hecho un muy buen trabajo y ahora se tiene que redondear con la victoria en soria estamos en tres competiciones y las lucharemos todas
9301944 una vez hayamos jugado sabremos si es un grupo f cil o dif cil
9301945 por un nombre se pueda saber la calidad de un equipo sobre el terreno de juego
9301946 the bigger the audience the better i play i will feel nervous if im not well prepared but thats not usual its exciting and exhilarating to be on stage when i go on the stage theres nothing more exciting than feeling that yourself the orchestra and the audience are in total harmony
9301947 i like ping pong telling jokes swimming and playing with my friends because i am home schooled i have more time to play when i am at home because i do not have to go to school unlike other children who are confined in school for seven hours a day thats a lot of work for them
9301948 he is perfect musically and also perfect at getting the audience into the music
9301949 if i have a gift from god it is my mom who is my angel
9301950 i try not to think about what a huge responsibility it is
9301951 i never expected when i was pregnant with marc that he would be a prodigy i played music to him before he was born just because i hoped it would help him develop a love of music
9301952 i am no expert but i believe that it is more nurture than nature so children should not be discouraged because they are not born with an obvious talent it is not easy to become a virtuoso it takes a lot of work and dedication
9301953 what other children learn in eight hours a day he can squeeze into 30 minutes or an hour this way he can learn whatever he is interested in at that moment
9301954 i like playing music because it has a lot of different feelings expressive sad excited and happy music is just full of emotions thats what i love about it i like playing difficult pieces especially those that my teacher says no to practice really does make perfect
9301955 according to forbes magazine i earned 32 million last year
9301956 my dad was a founder member of a leftwing theatre company i went to a comprehensive what do you think
9301957 people from the guardian and observer always want to know that its weird
9301958 why are you so obsessed with poshness somebody from the observer asked me why i dont have a cockney accent seeing as i went to a comprehensive school
9301959 not everyone who goes to comprehensive school has a cockney accent i think i probably did have more of an estuary accent coming from teddington its more estuary cockney is more east london
9301960 youre an actor so act oi shes stealing my lines give me a script then
9301961 the way you can have extremely strong people who actually in private are completely breaking down everyone does it presents a front that is actually no one can ever know whats going on emotionally inside
9301962 am i very lonely and terribly trapped and all the rest of it no i dont particularly look for characters that are like some kind of biography of myself no
9301963 i wasnt particularly confident about it which i think actually helped because i dont think that confidence is always a very helpful thing i really found it very difficult to get a grasp of her
9301964 id probably shit myself if i had to give a speech
9301965 theres always an element of fear that youre not going to be able to make people believe in the fiction that suddenly youre going to be standing there in your dress and wig and feel like a complete wanker which is not particularly helpful
9301966 i think ive simply read better characters in period pieces than i have in contemporary which is a pity i dont know why that is but i havent been kind of going i really want to do another period film ive just been led by what scripts ive thought were good and what film makers i thought were good
9301967 i dont think weve really changed that much in our essence
9301968 as an actress i hope not it would be quite sad if i said yes ive only been making films for the past five years you change as a person all the time and so therefore the way you perceive the world and situations and the way you portray characters is going to change i think thats the aim
9301969 youre not actually going to quote me something really shitty that someones said are you
9301970 if you want to befriend a woman ask her the question what do you think of keira knightley in the resulting torrent of bile and loathing you will bond
9301971 well im doing a good thing for women all over the country then
9301972 maybe you should ask the woman who wrote it i think if you put yourself in the public forum then thats what you put yourself up for i guess i dont think i need to read it i have friends
9301973 i think manipulation is something that women do a lot its still our number one problem
9301974 you look at those characters in the duchess georgiana and bess and theyre hugely trying to outmanoeuvre each other but i think its also possible for intense love affairs to happen between women not necessarily sexual but things can obviously take a sexual turn women do get obsessed with other women whether they love them or hate them and i think that line is very easy to cross
9301975 someone saying you have a mental illness is obviously rather difficult to take and particularly when theyre blaming you for killing someone
9301976 right now it would be hard yes i could do open university

9301996 to try to erase many years of thinking about either needing to change their sound or evolve
9301997 if your marching orders for the first 20 years have been change change change then letting go of those preconceived ideas is in its own way a new idea
9301998 rick put this mantra over our heads which was dont be afraid of your past you dont have to copy it but its o k to be inspired by it
9301999 somebody would smuggle one in but you didnt know that person you asked around and somebody would give you a cassette a copy of a copy of a copy
9302000 i said to them lets say there was a battle of the bands coming up and nobody knew who they were and they cant rely on any of their hits to get them over what would that sound like
9302001 it cant sound like those songs because you already have those songs
9302002 the exercise wasnt to rewrite songs like that but to write songs in that spirit
9302003 you cant make yourself a virgin again but i got what rubin meant
9302004 nobody was being selfish it was like going to the best music school you could imagine
9302005 like most musicians im a little insecure about my playing
9302006 i would say that was a different person i know more now
9302007 i needed to take the reins again and get heavy and scary with myself again
9302008 i think its a lot easier to access now i know how far i want to go with it and ive gone far and still been o k ive had duality my whole life theres the person i hide and the person i show
9302009 when thats done i get to go sit by myself
9302010 so i am both is that the one i want to be is this the one i want to be probably neither
9302011 were not so focused on whether or not we can play it were better
9302012 da miedo creo que las reacciones impulsivas de este se or no son necesariamente las mejores
9302013 el problema es que cuando uno reacciona de ese modo est dando por acabada la discusi n env a el mensaje de que no quiere seguir dialogando
9302014 cuando uno tiene estos arrebatos como senador no sucede nada porque no afecta a la vida p blica pero si uno se enfada as en la presidencia el resultado puede ser muy peligroso
9302015 perd neme por asumir que lo que usted me dijo en privado sobre colaborar en nuestros esfuerzos para elaborar una ley entre los dos partidos era una expresi n sincera
9302016 no supe ver que sus palabras eran la t pica parafernalia ret rica que se usa en pol tica para los propios intereses de partido y para que usted fingiera que es alguien m s noble perdone la confusi n pero est seguro de que no volver a cometer el mismo error

9302024 no me parece adecuado bajarles los impuestos a los millonarios a costa de la clase media es un error
9302025 suficientes tropas norteamericanas en irak para cumplir con los objetivos iniciales
9302026 no tengo ni una gota de confianza en l nada
9302027 si no estamos dispuestos a aportar las tropas necesarias para ganar la victoria en s misma ser algo imposible
9302028 cruel inhumano o degradante de los prisioneros bajo custodia de ee uu
9302029 no decirles a los soldados lo que est permitido y lo que est prohibido cuando las cosas salen mal culpamos a las tropas y las castigamos francamente creo que podemos hacerlo mejor
9302030 pero lo importante aqu no es qui n es el enemigo es qui nes somos nosotros nuestros valores nos distinguen de nuestros enemigos
9302031 hago esto para dejarle claro al mundo que este gobierno no tortura y que nos adherimos a las convenciones internacionales contra la tortura sea aqu o en otros pa ses
9302032 hay una gran diferencia entre el mccain que vemos en los medios el h roe de la prensa norteamericana y el pol tico de verdad
9302033 mccain es alguien capaz de cambiar de argumentos de un d a a otro dependiendo de lo que m s le convenga ahora todo depende de lo que le ayude a ganar la presidencia
9302034 mccain no tiene predicamento entre la gran base evang lica del sur del pa s
9302035 los de los evang licos del sur son votos que bush se gan con mucho esfuerzo en realidad mccain es como el padre del actual presidente un candidato con pocas credenciales religiosas que va a tener que hacer muchas concesiones frente a bush hijo para ganar estados como carolina del norte florida o virginia
9302036 siempre hemos estado a favor de que la cia utilice ciertas medidas adicionales en los interrogatorios
9302037 es desastroso que mccain haya cambiado de opini n respecto a la tortura con tal de ganar unas elecciones
9302038 nos parece que fue un mal paso en una trayectoria que por lo dem s hab a sido impecable
9302039 obviamente tiene sus razones para tomar esta decisi n entre ellas la de presentarse a unas elecciones en el partido republicano
9302040 es la primera vez que un presidente supera la barrera del 70 de desaprobaci n
9302041 no necesitamos otro pol tico en washington que anteponga sus intereses y sus lazos pol ticos a la capacidad de resolver problemas
9302042 yo antepondr a mi pa s siempre siempre siempre ya lo hice en aquellos d as en que estaba en prisi n y se me ofreci marcharme a casa antes que mis compa eros de cautiverio el pa s primero
9302043 algunos ven la bandera como un s mbolo de esclavitud otros la ven como un s mbolo de nuestra herencia cultural yo la veo como un s mbolo de herencia cultural
9302044 podr a haber pronunciado la respuesta de memoria pero me empe en escenificar el teatro de desdoblar el papel y leerlo como si fuera un reh n leyendo un comunicado de mis captores quer a enviar a los periodistas el mensaje de que yo en realidad no apoyaba que la bandera siguiera ondeando pero que los imperativos pol ticos me obligaban a ser esquivo
9302045 estoy en contra del aborto soy fiscalmente un conservador a favor de las pol ticas de familia aun as pat robertson jerry falwell y algunos l deres del movimiento antiabortista de washington dicen que soy un candidato presidencial inaceptable
9302046 el reverendo vino a verme a mi oficina y me pidi que super ramos nuestras diferencias lo hice con mucho gusto
9302047 en verdad creo que han sido los paganos los abortistas las feministas los gays y las lesbianas que tratan de convertirse en un estilo de vida alternativo yo les apunto con el dedo a la cara y les digo hab is hecho posible que todo esto ocurra
9302048 cuando me convert en uno de los principales abogados de la causa de la reforma de la financiaci n electoral llegu a darme cuenta de que las sospechas de la ciudadan a no son infundadas
9302049 el dinero te abre muchas puertas en washington y este acceso incrementa la influencia y as se benefician unos pocos a costa de muchos otros
9302050 hay pruebas suficientes de que gracias al rechazo del senador mccain a participar en el asunto acab distanci ndose del se or keating
9302051 a la gran mayor a de los americanos nos preocupa que ahora sea legal que una compa a subsidiaria de otra empresa controlada por el ej rcito chino done cantidades ilimitadas de dinero a campa as pol ticas norteamericanas
9302052 estoy de acuerdo vienen aqu de forma ilegal rompen nuestras leyes tienen que pagar si lo hacen pero redondear al alza y decir que 12 millones de personas deben volver al pa s del que vinieron es un insulto a la inteligencia y una franca contradicci n a lo que am rica representa
9302053 cuando hayamos cumplido nuestro objetivo de aportar m s seguridad a las fronteras podremos comenzar con las otras partes de la pol tica migratoria
9302054 el candidato est tratando de resucitar algunos elementos de la pol tica neoconservadora de bush sobre todo con su nfasis en una guerra global contra el terrorismo
9302055 si examinamos sus ideas en pol tica econ mica y exterior mccain y bush han acabado sorprendentemente cerca
9302056 todo lo que puedo decir es que en los principios fundamentales del partido republicano y en los asuntos concretos de nuestra filosof a compartida el presidente bush y yo estamos totalmente de acuerdo

9302101 there are several locations around the job site where children have signed their names this is unacceptable to the city and we will have the contractor remove and replace these pieces
9302102 if this keeps up we will be forced to contact the edina police department for assistance
9302103 we pretty much took care of it without having to replace it
9302104 the contractors got to it right away and smoothed it out
9302105 well start the boarding process now with our first class customers
9302106 if youre bringing on people who need assistance younger kids all at once you potentially create a bottleneck on the front end as opposed to randomly dispersing them based on where people are sitting in the aircraft
9302107 this is something that has been needed to be done for a long time
9302108 i think i use every inch of this 1 096 acre park
9302109 i run ride walk and cross country ski here i run a six mile loop and ride on 25 miles of trails its a great workout id rather be riding outdoors than ride a bike indoors
9302110 you have to focus you have to be present in the moment
9302111 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9302112 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9302113 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region
9302114 this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9302115 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9302116 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9302117 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms you need to be scared you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans this is the storm of the century
9302118 mccain says he might delay the republican convention if a major hurricane hits the gulf coast
9302119 pompeii and the roman villa art and culture around the bay of naples
9302120 no 1 be bold and aggressive on issues and priorities most important to the american people
9302121 no 2 make sure that people understand that barack obamas views are not in the best interest of the country
9302122 a strong record of increasing taxes on energy which is exactly the wrong direction for the country
9302123 john mccain issued one statement that was definitive clear and reflected the reality of the situation
9302124 in contrast barack obama issued three or four statements steadily evolving over several days essentially into sen mccains position
9302125 this was a snapshot of the value of having experienced wisdom and judgment on these matters
9302126 mccain was able to articulate what he believes in a crisp decisive manner
9302127 in contrast it was one of those instances where you dont see barack obama with a teleprompter hes kind of stammering wandering halting hes asked basic questions like why do you want to be president when does life begin and he gives fairly unconvincing fairly unclear answers
9302128 mccain has an extraordinary compelling story of accomplishment and service and putting country first even if it meant great peril for him physically politically or otherwise
9302129 obamas resume is quite thin at least for the purpose of someone who wants to be president of the united states
9302130 barack obama has not led the country on an issue of national significance in a way that has cost him anything politically he always toes the partisan line
9302131 everybodys for that that wasnt some act of courage to take on his party
9302132 i will not bow i will not step down and i will not resign despite the pressure mounting on my government
9302133 since the government cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9302134 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9302135 and it is warm not something im really used to
9302136 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9302137 can be a distraction in these kinds of situations so we want to make sure that were monitoring the situation and that were being useful
9302138 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9302139 while i encourage you to engage in the political process please use good judgment regarding participation in activities that might violate state or local laws or the universitys student conduct code
9302140 as an example if university students are arrested or ticketed for illegal activity that damages property or poses risks to the safety of others on or off campus such behavior will be considered for adjudication under the conduct code
9302141 this is clearly an attempt to scare students and is meant to have a chilling effect on participation in the protests of the rnc
9302142 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principle that our works define who we are then god is evil
9302143 what kind of question is this of course it exists have you never been cold
9302144 in fact sir cold does notexist according to the laws of physics what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat everybody or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy absolute zero 2730c is the total absence of heat all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature cold does not exist we have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat
9302145 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light we can study light but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colours and study the various wavelengths of each colour you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darknessis a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
9302146 of course as i have already said we see it everyday it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
9302147 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has god did not create evil evil is not like faith or love that exist just as does light and heat evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light
9302148 the purple panel traps will not bring emerald ash borers into a noninfested site
9302149 these traps help us determine if the pest is already there
9302150 anybody who rides here knows this was the biggest mud hole probably from forever
9302151 to protect and encourage shared use trail access in western pennsylvania
9302152 they do work no one else wants to do and they do it with a smile
9302153 we got everyone together in the same room and talked about what we wanted to do
9302154 each group was told they would have a voice in how things were done i said mountain biking is a perfectly proper leisure activity and that todays mountain bikers are yesterdays horsemen
9302155 in making this all work i cant say enough good things about him he was on vacation when the boyce park trail work was to be done he drove in to make sure the ptag volunteers had the tools they needed
9302156 the patient is now recovering and we hope to discharge him today sunday
9302157 into the darkness of my most inner being any time i get lost within myself
9302158 a sweet girlie with an eager mouth is such an easy sell on the street crossdressers are well known for their cocksucking talents sissy school
9302159 en quelque sorte dans ce contexte tendu on d couvre que faire
9302160 na t low cost on ne devient pas low cost
9302161 on a pas de p trole mais on a des id es
9302162 dat was ik niet hoor dat was mijn lichaam en dat is alleen maar vel met een spook erin
9302163 the bowery was very gritty when we first visited it
9302164 we were a bit shocked but we were also impressed that a contemporary art museum wanted to be there
9302165 you have given me and my family more you have given your people and this country more than you will ever know
9302166 if this work was hard or overwhelming if she ever felt any loneliness in so often being the first you never wouldve known it
9302167 because stephanie was not a complainer she always had that big smile even when times were tough self pity was never an option as far as stephanie was concerned
9302168 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides and she we would see each other and she just said to me this is what it means to be a friend for me
9302169 what struck me most about stephanie was how even after a decade in congress she was so utterly unaffected by the ways of washington
9302170 she was still a home girl stephanie couldnt put on airs if she tried
9302171 its just not what we wanted to face this soon after katrina
9302172 made instant converts out of even the most reluctant of us
9302173 our franchise is being the best and most thorough and most sophisticated analyzers of our own backyard
9302174 we are going to be much better prepared than we were three years ago
9302175 the economic impact of this four day event certainly has got to rank as one of the largest
9302176 it is important to recognize both private and public costs and benefits and carefully detail each
9302177 we have such a regular group of customers normally im at capacity
9302178 we havent seen any impact one way or the other no increase or no decrease
9302179 hopefully it will trigger some interest in us down the road you often never know how people hear of you
9302180 it has been a grand slam home run for us in terms of getting a good global media coverage
9302181 i have lived in denver for almost 25 years and i have never been more energized or seen the city more energized
9302182 northwood community park is the center of life in northwood
9302183 i really saw this sense of community there that i didnt even know existed anymore
9302184 i appreciate that i lived next to the freeway for eight years and it wore on me quite a bit
9302185 we had one of the people on our street that had a motor home and didnt want to pay to store it so he built a garage that looks like a fire station
9302186 the lord is with everyone so of course everything would be ok
9302187 i think once i get there to arkansas im going straight to stone mountain ga
9302188 i gave myself a year and a half to make it in new orleans but the city isnt back from katrina and its time to leave
9302189 if i can find the work i dont have to go back
9302190 the only luxury senior living community with an in city location that puts seniors right smack in the action of dining shopping cultural and sports opportunities without having to drive a long time to get there
9302191 wanting to put the lawn mower away for good having the ability to lock and leave when they go on vacation or wanting to remain in colorados four seasons
9302192 those children have higher expectations for the features of their own homes and want the same for their parents
9302193 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9302194 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9302195 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9302196 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9302197 highest proportion of income transferred to loss reserves since 1989
9302198 2 in provisions for future loss for every 1 in current defaults
9302199 then i hear someone outside one morning and i go outside and see a sign on my door that says theyre auctioning the house
9302200 and families who are very low income feel the costs of having to move even more than other people
9302201 the research shows that there are going to be more waves of these mortgages resetting and people wont be able to make the payments thats going to be devastating for these renters who have been in their homes in some cases for 10 or 15 years
9302202 i took out so many personal loans from friends just to keep paying my bills that for a while i was just hiding in my house
9302203 these low income renters werent involved in the housing problem or at least thats what they thought
9302204 obviously we cant hold the mortgage company accountable for a contract they dont have with us
9302205 airline travel is airline travel its been bad for a long time
9302206 i suspect prices will go up fewer people will travel and if youre willing to pay the price it will be fine
9302207 if somebody sees a good fare they should grab it
9302208 weve been making improvements along the way but we have rooms that are hot in the summer and cold in the winter so we were trying to find out some answers as to why
9302209 everything is going to be costing more and you want to make sure that youre not tossing money out the window by doing some very simple things
9302210 the knowledge level of consumers is so much higher than it used to be
9302211 a lot of projects now are very collaborative where consumers are coming in needing fairly high level questions answered
9302212 the purpose of this program is to improve energy savings by influencing homeowners and renters behaviors through conservation education
9302213 a lot of the newer rebate programs and even new building programs are now requiring energy audits for houses that are going to be installing solar
9302214 in the case of boulder they require comprehensive energy audits before you can make additions or make major changes to a home to ensure that the changes you are going to do arent going to make the home less energy efficient
9302215 police and prosecutors have shared the grief of families but have so often been unable to seek justice for the full offense
9302216 we think there are several types of value to this law
9302217 one is deterrence hopefully people will take this into account when they beat up on a woman
9302218 he had a name he was loved and his life was violently taken from him before he ever saw the sun
9302219 the concept of a fetus or unborn child as a potential victim of violence is neither obscure nor difficult to grasp
9302220 congress made it evident that the protections of federal criminal law may be extended to an unborn crime victim
9302221 when i started this my wife said be sure to keep it nonpartisan
9302222 elevate that and do not say youre for anybody but youre for america
9302223 iran is changing its cars to run on natural gas and were not doing a thing here theyre doing this to use less oil and sell it for 120 a barrel
9302224 they said can you prove were doing nothing about it well so much for free speech
9302225 wheres the money gonna come from to jump start the economy
9302226 the only pot of money thats big enough and fast enough and easy enough to lay our hands on is boone pickens 700 billion thats why i support pickens
9302227 he is a great spokesperson for what were trying to do with global climate change
9302228 but we want to create good green collar jobs and i think its nice to have someone abandon the oil companies and come on over and say thats yesterdays solution we need tomorrows solution for that i respect him funding the swift boat ads against john kerry four years ago no respect
9302229 this is the beach house of your dreams and everybodys favorite omelet bar
9302230 so bite size vegetables fruit or cheese and crackers work well
9302231 more realtors seem to come to see your listings if food is served
9302232 and one of the problems is that you draw in agents not looking to do business but who are looking to do lunch
9302233 if it was listed for sale at 13 million and the agents were getting a bigger commission for their work
9302234 to be walking around a 20 million house with a wrap in one hand a diet coke in the other
9302235 get in look at the house and meet with my team over lunch after the caravan to talk about potential buyers for what weve seen
9302236 pecan chess key lime texas silk the soon to be famous cowboy cookie
9302237 oh you want lunch well girl let me tell you i make the best chicken salad sandwich this side of the rio grande
9302238 i knew i had to wait till after i was 40 otherwise nobody believes you can really be a pie maker because youre too young
9302239 cant wait to get back there and have another of your texas silk pies
9302240 that is just the coolest biggest gift in the world
9302241 weve raised almost 3 million and its going to be fantastic its something im very passionate about
9302242 the terms of the conversation about sex and love in the united states
9302243 titanic emotional and physical explosion that culminates the act of marriage
9302244 managed to undo the most important achievements of the sexual revolution
9302245 you have fads that go in and out but john nyquists style has been unchanged for decades
9302246 he never made a shape that didnt serve a purpose he is a connoisseur using design to bring out the qualities of fine woods
9302247 once you solve the problem of how a piece must function let the wood speak for itself
9302248 i love to look at it and decide the best way to use it and shape it to turn it into something one of a kind
9302249 where hard right angles are softened by curved and sloping lines like the flirty outward kick of a chairs back legs
9302250 the wood just glows and thats because of his careful sanding polishing and finishing which is an art form in itself
9302251 its humanistic yet its sophisticated design gives it a modernist high style spin that makes it feel at home in such disparate interiors as arts and crafts and contemporary
9302252 then we moved into a modern one with running water
9302253 john even used leather from connolly a british firm that did the interiors of rolls royces and jaguars
9302254 which is quite appropriate since he is obviously an aesthete and his work has the classic curves of luxury motor cars
9302255 were not a dying breed but our clientele has changed a lot over the years
9302256 theyre further and fewer between but they do like to spend the money if they have it
9302257 its made in long beach you can smell the sea and the salt air and get to know the man with the hands and smile who designed and built this furniture who takes your measurements and makes the host and hostess chair different sizes to fit each one perfectly
9302258 its a relationship that cannot happen with mass production furniture
9302259 it is all about making students feel welcome excited and motivated on the first day of school
9302260 i think most parents were really surprised to see the superintendent and all those officials
9302261 it was the smoothest opening in the four years that i have been here
9302262 we try to make it an exciting welcome for the kids
9302263 im at a loss for words im ecstatic about it
9302264 at the same time i have mixed feelings her mother made some bad choices
9302265 i wanted my daughter to have a mother and a father
9302266 when an emergency happens the most important thing to remember is dont panic
9302267 allows california to grow but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals
9302268 gas prices certainly may have an impact on growth patterns but i think thats only one piece of it
9302269 im not confident that the current state of gas prices alone will combat sprawl
9302270 this is not about mandating where people live but it is about urging our cities and counties about being more thoughtful about where people live
9302271 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future the strategy outlines in detail the range of weather conditions facing london which could both seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people and endanger our pre eminence as one of the worlds leading cities
9302272 london is not unique all major cities such as new york and tokyo are at risk from climate change
9302273 it is essential that the capital prepares for the impacts of climate change which is already affecting londoners through increased flood risk heavier and more frequent downpours and extreme heat
9302274 the mayor must provide a comprehensive action plan for reducing emissions that includes ways to make it cheaper and easier for londoners to go green
9302275 we are trying to provide a safety net to meet the needs of those suffering in this economy and having to change their way of life
9302276 the only good thing about the jump in food stamps is that the nutritional needs especially of children and seniors are being taken care of
9302277 people who never expected to ask for our services are coming to us
9302278 we have many patients in this community who are one paycheck away from this clinic
9302279 there are a lot more people who dont come to the shelter
9302280 the cost of living and the cost of housing in harford are so high poor people have to wait years to get an apartment at this shelter sometimes there are so many people its standing room only
9302281 we are getting families from this immediate area who need help with rent gas food and utilities
9302282 the demographics and needs vary from single moms to seniors and we dont turn anyone away
9302283 the level is possibly higher due to the bad economy but you have to be careful how you look at the data
9302284 a 5 percent level is a concern but historically that has been the number for the county
9302285 it would mean some 6 000 people moved out of the county and came back the next year
9302286 this is either an aberration or a mistake a three year average would be a better indicator
9302287 those numbers are not going down not if you look at our patient load
9302288 we have always had a fair number of working poor people who are usually sicker and need more time to treat
9302289 now we have quite a few young people nearly all uninsured and many with chronic conditions that no physician has managed we are averaging about 200 patients a month double what we had last year by this time next year we expect to double again
9302290 the site also lists all the agricultural agencies related businesses and calendar events
9302291 we have plenty of food to buy here you dont really have to leave the county to buy food
9302292 this is all about marketing and letting people know what is out there
9302293 i had calls for my hay last year from all up and down the east coast because of it
9302294 when you buy local you dont have to worry about spoilage and transportation from thousands of miles away
9302295 people know that what is grown here is well taken care of
9302296 people like to know where their food comes from and they appreciate that its available locally
9302297 if you want to expand your web site this is the way to go
9302298 everybody who wants to be listed is there the county can continually add to it and it has been made so easy for consumers
9302299 this tool shows them what they can buy locally and how to get there the site really puts everybody together it will help keep farms profitable and viable into the future
9302300 with my mom working i either had to learn how to cook or eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
9302301 i think it goes back to my boy scout fascination with fire
9302302 wine tastings and wine events are becoming popular at golf courses and other outside venues
9302303 we started the classes to give guests a chance to see the culinary side of mountain branch
9302304 we wanted to give people a chance to come here take a class and take what they learned home and try it
9302305 my main focus today is to teach you how to make these items at home on the grill in a timely fashion
9302306 it was three years before they let me touch a knife or turn on a grill
9302307 but i was passionate about cooking it was in my soul
9302308 my passion for cooking helped me realize a dream to be an executive chef
9302309 it takes most people 30 years to achieve that dream but i did it in 10 years
9302310 i like cooking these peppers like this because you can burn them and then use them
9302311 i learned some new ways to do things such as how to properly make a vinaigrette dressing and how to soak brine
9302312 youre welcome i had a plan it was the best plan that i could make and for the plan to work the coffee had to cool enough that it wouldnt burn your tongue im glad that you appreciate my plan i wasnt 100 sure that it would work who wants to go in and have bread and hot chocolate
9302313 we kind of knew with the economy being so bad it would be tough we postponed the addition of first grade until next year
9302314 but we have a capacity for up to 900 students it would have been nice to have 850 students we have no fat on our budget at all well have to be really tight with spending this year
9302315 its no secret that the economy is hurting private schools
9302316 but we cant predict the prolonged effect of the poor economy on our schools enrollment and so far the brac realignment the nationwide military base reorganization has not had a great influence on enrollment but weve been told that things will pick up in two years
9302317 we have definitely started to see the impact of brac
9302318 surprisingly they are not all coming from new jersey we have kids coming from florida and texas who say they are here because of base realignment and their parents job has been transferred here
9302319 we wanted to find the best teacher for the job the problem is that the teacher wasnt chosen until late may and parents like to meet the teacher and know who will be teaching their children
9302320 then he called one day completely ecstatic he told me that he was getting a house and getting a job and he needed help to find furniture it was so wonderful that he was getting what he needed
9302321 we have 30 to 40 people come into the center each day and we only have a small little area where they can go
9302322 what fascinated me most was seeing the crowd react to the different speeches
9302323 dutchs arthritis was so severe that he didnt even like to be touched and after massage his bodys much looser and he loves being touched
9302324 i see dogs who have arthritis elbow dysplasia and other issues if massage can help them avoid surgery thats fantastic
9302325 we outfitted the city and volunteer fire authorities plus some for windsor wellington and loveland with three sizes of canine oxygen masks
9302326 i didnt have enough strength to hold my body up so if i went down the slide my feet might get caught underneath me and id get a twisted ankle or a sprain
9302327 as we acquire more knowledge things do not become more comprehensible but more mysterious
9302328 if july 15 was a true bottom the market should be roaring up today and thats not whats been happening caution is warranted
9302329 as shown in the chart below the reading has been creeping higher and higher since mid july and looks to be on its way to the 80 to 85 levels seen twice over the last year readings above 50 are signs of a healthy market and it hasnt been above 50 for much of 2008
9302330 september has firmly secured the rank as the worst month of the year
9302331 global business sentiment remains weak and fragile and consistent with recession in the us europe and japan
9302332 across the globe sentiment is consistent with an economy that is near recession pricing pressures remain very elevated but fell notably last week
9302333 even many mainstream economists are now suggesting we will be in a recession by the fourth quarter if we are not in one now the recovery when it comes will be tepid until credit spreads signal an end to the credit crisis it is going to be muddle through for 2009 this is not going to be good for the stock market when will it be safe to get back into the water pay attention to credit spreads
9302334 shares in fannie mae and freddie mac fell on friday amid concerns foreign investors were reassessing their exposure to the troubled us mortgage financiers bonds and guaranteed securities
9302335 bank of china this week revealed it had cut its portfolio of securities issued or guaranteed by the two government sponsored enterprises by a quarter or 4 6 billion since the end of june the sale underscored signs of nervousness among foreign buyers of fannie and freddies debt
9302336 federal reserve custody data on thursday showed foreign official and private investors reduced their holdings of agency debt for the sixth consecutive week
9302337 bill odonnell analyst at ubs said if this recent theme of cooling passions for gses debt becomes a longer term trend then it could be problematic for the gses given that the central banks have taken roughly 30 to 60 of new gse issuance in recent months and years
9302338 the us treasury was granted powers last month to extend its credit lines to fannie and freddie and to invest in their debt and equity
9302339 for fannie may and freddie mac the game is over the sage of omaha has spoken
9302340 warren buffett the worlds richest man said it was no longer feasible for americas two biggest mortgage finance companies to exist independently he went on to forecast that the us economy would remain in the doldrums for at least five months
9302341 fannie and freddie which underpin americas mortgage market by buying home loans and packaging them into bonds did not have any net worth mr buffett told cnbc
9302342 mr buffett was also downbeat about the housing market and in turn the broader economy
9302343 mr buffett who runs the berkshire hathaway investment group from its headquarters in omaha nebraska added you always find out whos been swimming naked when the tide goes out we found out that wall street has been kind of a nudist beach
9302344 mr buffett said he expected more banks to fail especially in areas where there was a housing bubble we will see failures where the bankers were dumb in what they did he said
9302345 more than a year into the credit crisis the worlds top central bankers admit they are still in the dark as to what its ultimate impact on the global economy will be
9302346 by the same token they are unsure to what extent weakening growth will help to ease high inflation
9302347 there is enormous uncertainty about where we stand at the moment stanley fischer governor of the bank of israel said at the close of the federal reserves annual retreat in jackson hole wyoming
9302348 his comments came as us treasury officials worked through the weekend on options for fannie mae and freddie mac the troubled mortgage groups amid expectations an announcement could come this week
9302349 mr fischer told central bankers from 43 nations we are in the midst of the worst financial crisis since world war ii but it was still not clear how big an event it would turn out to be
9302350 so far he said in real economy terms we are not looking at anything exceptional but the crisis was entering a second round in which economic and financial weakness could feed on each other
9302351 other current and former central bankers shared this view alan blinder a former fed vice chairman said it is amazing a year later how much is still unresolved
9302352 monetary policymakers appear torn between hope that the global economy is turning out to be resilient in part thanks to policy interventions and fear that the worst could lie ahead
9302353 they think the economy will muddle through and recover next year but they cannot rule out the possibility that the financial crisis in conjunction with the oil shock could deliver a bad economic outcome
9302354 my invitation to hob nob with the worlds monetary muckety mucks in jackson hole this weekend got lost in the mail yet again
9302355 too bad they are little more than corks tossed on violent seas of global forces totally beyond their control
9302356 the inflationary tide in global liquidity could be turning the sharp break in gold suggests that could be happening and thats being transmitted through the commodities markets
9302357 thats something that the crowd in jackson hole can scarcely control so they might as well enjoy themselves on their junket
9302358 us and european banks already burdened by losses and concerns about their financial health face a new challenge paying off hundreds of billions of dollars of debt coming due
9302359 at issue are so called floating rate notes securities used heavily by banks in 2006 to borrow money
9302360 the crunch will begin next month when some 95 billion in floating rate notes mature
9302361 the problem highlights how the pain of the credit crunch now entering its second year wont end soon for banks or the broader economy
9302362 the credit crunch is entering a second post subprime phase where banks loan books deteriorate more rapidly and capital raising efforts might become harder says scott bugie credit analyst at standard amp poors
9302363 loan book deterioration is starting to hit a wider array of financial institutions as credit losses migrate from subprime into other sectors of household finance such as credit cards alt a and prime mortgages and auto loans well into 2009 he says
9302364 mr bugie believes losses on the loan books of us banks could reach 265 billion a year for the next two to three years in europe he says the focus of concern is shifting to commercial loans as european economies enter a downturn
9302365 while capital raising has largely offset losses that financial institutions have incurred from writedowns much of the capital raised has been in the form of hybrid securities with both debt and equity characteristics he says
9302366 consequently the quality of the banks capital has eroded somewhat
9302367 and he warns that in the us and europe a major concern is regional banks ability to raise capital
9302368 the main message from the minutes of the august 5 fomc meeting is that the fed is on hold for several meetings barring unexpected developments
9302369 brilliant bloomberg columnist caroline baum probably knows the bond market better than anyone else i know
9302370 whats going on one school holds that bonds are mispriced buyers are either complacent or smoking something stronger than tobacco even if they are in full command of their faculties they are choosing liquidity over yield
9302371 remember years ago i said that the big problem coming up would be income everybodys going to need income and income will be hard to come by im still of that same opinion my dear subscribers hunker down theres a hard rain acomin were heading into de leveraging and deflation and nobodys positioned for it
9302372 harvard university economist martin feldstein a member of the committee that charts american business cycles said the federal reserve cannot count on low interest rates to buoy economic growth sheryl king merrill lynch economic domino effect
9302373 the us economy grew at an annual rate of 3
9302374 massive policy easing and fiscal stimulus have not been sufficient to offset the drags from a housing bust and squeeze on consumption
9302375 the conference boards us leading economic indicator lei fell again in july providing a fresh reminder that the slowdown is far from over a domestic recession is underway and policy efforts to stimulate growth have been short circuited by a collapse of risk taking in the financial markets
9302376 mortgage rates rose as policy rates declined underscoring that the housing slump will persist rumors that the treasury department may have to absorb the two large gses are proliferating underscoring the seriousness of the banking and financial crisis please see the next insight
9302377 us core durable goods orders rose further in july underscoring that business investment has held up well in face of a domestic recession and tight credit conditions however risks remain to the downside
9302378 investment spending has been a relative bright light for the us economy mainly because a weak dollar has allowed us companies to gain global market share and overseas demand has been resilient
9302379 durable goods orders beat expectations with a 1 3 month on month increase in july but the apparent strength is due to higher prices not stronger activity in fact deflating orders by the producer price index for durable manufactured goods shows a 9 4 year on year drop in real orders the worst since early 2002 even if we adjust for the unfavorable year on year comparisons that partly explain this plunge the recent data look surprisingly similar to those seen in the run up to the 2001 recession
9302380 the price to rent ratio of homes is a useful measure to put home price trends in a big picture framework
9302381 the price to rent ratio used here is computed from the national case shiller home price index and owners equivalent rent of the consumer price index
9302382 compared with these numbers the 125 4 price to rent ratio in the second quarter of 2008 is still at an elevated level it appears that home prices have a long march ahead when compared with the mean 109 6 and median 102 5 price to rent ratio for the period 1987 2008 q2 also
9302383 if history is any guide the price to rent ratio suggest that the bottom of home prices is not here yet
9302384 both the national association of realtors and the case shiller index confirm that us house prices continue to fall sharply
9302385 a domestic recession is underway and a rising unemployment rate means that the uptrend in foreclosure rates will spread beyond the sub prime market
9302386 merrill lynchs losses in the past 18 months amount to about a quarter of the profits it has made in its 36 years as a listed company according to financial times research that highlights the extent of the global banking crisis
9302387 since the onset of the credit crunch last year merrill has suffered after tax losses of more than 14 billion as its balance sheet has been savaged by almost 52 billion in writedowns and credit related losses
9302388 merrills total inflation adjusted profits between its 1971 listing and 2006 were about 56 billion according to figures from thomson reuters fundamentals and an ft analysis of reported earnings
9302389 the 14 billion in losses for 2007 and the first two quarters of 2008 equal half of merrills profits since the beginning of the decade
9302390 merrill had the highest ratio of credit crunch losses to historical profits among 10 us and european financial groups analysed by the ft which included citigroup jpmorgan chase bank of america morgan stanley goldman sachs lehman brothers bank of america credit suisse and ubs
9302391 ubs which has lost more than 15 billion during the crisis had the second highest ratio
9302392 us companies are set to switch to international accounting rules in a move that will for the first time see all the worlds most important listed groups reporting according to the same set of standards
9302393 the us securities and exchange commission on wednesday proposed a roadmap to manage the migration of us companies from its rules to the international ones the plans are open to comment for 60 days
9302394 more than 100 countries use or are adopting international financial reporting standards ifrs including all 27 european union members as well as china japan canada and india us gaap the accounting lingua franca until the sudden rise of ifrs is the last significant standard to be switched
9302395 under the secs plans us groups are likely to adopt ifrs in 2014 providing certain conditions are met a decision that will be taken in 2011 some companies may be allowed to adopt ifrs sooner
9302396 christopher cox sec chairman said more groups were reporting under ifrs than us gaap and the number would rise as other large economies made the switch he said us gaap would be marginalised if the us did nothing making it harder for international investors to consider us companies
9302397 a single set of globally understood accounting rules is expected to help cut companies cost of capital and better enable cross border investment in countries without strong accounting traditions the rules are expected to raise the quality of reporting helping inward investment
9302398 when it comes to gauging how bad things may get for the global economy central bankers say they are uncertain a glance at government bond yields backs that nerve wracking outlook
9302399 in the past month us german uk and japanese bond yields have been falling as investors have dismissed the threat of inflation and priced in a higher risk of global recession led by the big economies
9302400 the expectation of rate cuts in the uk and eurozone should be vindicated by weaker growth and lower inflation in the coming months in the us the sharp cuts earlier this year should suffice unless the economy hits a wall in 2009
9302401 at the centre of the big freeze us policymakers still face challenges as home prices keep falling while inventories of unsold properties rise
9302402 with economic gloom deepening falling us treasury yields have been accompanied by rising yields for corporate and mortgage bonds until house prices stabilise banking writedowns will sustain a bid for government debt at the relative expense of other riskier fixed income securities
9302403 at some point however selling long dated treasuries and buying risky mortgage and corporate bonds will become the dominant trade for investors one barometer to watch will be a sharply steeper yield curve whereby long term yields rise much more than those of the two year note
9302404 once banks have plugged all their balance sheet holes a steeper treasury curve will facilitate borrowing at low rates and the buying of longer dated higher yielding mortgages and other debt call it a carry trade on steroids that slowly helps banks nurse their balance sheets back to health
9302405 unfortunately for the fed the stars are not yet aligned for banks and investors to play the game of ultimate carry which suggests that further selling of risky assets beckons
9302406 on august 26 lowrys selling pressure index reached its highest level ever 756 while lowrys buying power index dropped to a multi year low of 210
9302407 i just talked to paul desmond who runs lowrys i asked him why he was so sure that we were heading for 90 down days his answer was that this rally is so weak overall volume was only 3 7 billion today and today upside volume was only 62 8 of up down volume furthermore paul noted that breadth is very weak breadth should be exploding on the upside here but thats not happening in all this is a weak rally suggesting that worse action lies ahead
9302408 for the second consecutive two week period short interest on the new york stock exchange declined
9302409 the oversold rally commencing in mid july has certainly stalled here is what it would take to revive it
9302410 sustained breaks above the august rally highs to date for major indices preferably with financials participating
9302411 this is a big ask without a catalyst such as a change in the emphasis of monetary policy from fighting inflation to boosting economic growth whether this rubicon is crossed in the next few weeks or sometime next year remains to be seen and probably depends on events
9302412 meanwhile valuations are much improved albeit still well above record attractive levels
9302413 in other words some of the year long concerns are either abating or at least priced into markets to a not insignificant degree
9302414 nevertheless investors are understandably cautious given all the financial concerns whether largely discounted or not and everyone knows that most stock markets are still in overall downtrends therefore the upside is as we say for the bulls to prove judging from the sluggish chart action the fear of further losses is still greater than the fear of being of being left behind in the next good rally
9302415 as the unofficial end of summer draws near market activity is likely to pick up in the coming weeks as traders set themselves up for the end of the year
9302416 with jim cramer having proclaimed that weve hit bottom and we will not take out the july 15th low im curious to see which etfs have been the raw performance leaders and laggards since that specific point the top ten for both are below
9302417 just as the stocks in the financial sector have stabilized while energy stocks have been weak analyst sentiment on the sectors seem to be following a similar trend
9302418 the russian stock market is arguably cheap with a trailing per of 8 although the russia rts index yields only 2
9302419 most of this break occurred as capitulation selling hit resources stocks everywhere making it the last sector to fall
9302420 taking a longer term view fullermoney continues to favour a policy of acquiring resources shares with substantial assets in the ground in politically stable regions
9302421 could russias stock market index fall further before it next experiences a sustained advance easily not least as there is no conclusive evidence that any stock market has bottomed is russias market likely to be higher in a year or two i think so
9302422 vietnams stock market offers investment opportunities after a 45 slump this year said mark mobius executive chairman of templeton asset management
9302423 vietnams stock market now is down so there are more opportunities mobius said in an interview in ho chi minh city where templeton opened its vietnam representative office today the market will go up and will be much more valuable in about three years
9302424 mobius who oversees about 40 billion in emerging market equities is increasing templetons investments in vietnam after it bought a 49 stake in the fund management unit of joint stock commercial bank for foreign trade of vietnam known as vietcombank fund management earlier this year
9302425 templeton is turning to emerging markets as it said earlier this month stocks tumbled more than justified because demand for raw materials continues to boost economic growth in those nations the msci emerging markets index has plunged 29 since reaching a record in october
9302426 vietnams central bank has raised interest rates three times this year to ease inflation
9302427 inflation is high but we are happy to see the government is acting rapidly and very strongly to beat inflation mobius said
9302428 the usds impressive rally has lost some momentum but that was inevitable following its upside breakout if we ask what was the last really important chart development usd strength is the only answer therefore we may only be seeing a consolidation prior to renewed gains
9302429 however that is what most people are predicting and hoping for because they are long
9302430 i remain sceptical of the usds alleged medium to longer term recovery scope for reasons previously discussed at length however psychology and technical action are the key short term drivers so i am waiting for clearer evidence of the next significant move either way
9302431 the world is now going through the deleveraging of the greatest credit mountain in human history the credit build up started right after world war ii what are the implications
9302432 the first theres a dash for cash throughout the world big sophisticated money sees whats going on and they want cash all the cash they can accumulate
9302433 second today all cash is fiat junk currency when this realization hits the next big move will be into the only reliable cash outside the central bank system that move will be to gold there will be a rush for gold somewhere ahead even now i suspect gold is in a bottoming process but not the gold shares
9302434 germanys bundesbank on friday rejected calls that it should sell some of its gold reserves to help boost the slowing german economy telling reuters financial and political uncertainty make the reserves even more important than before
9302435 gold sales are not a suitable way to sustainably consolidate the public accounts the bundesbank said after a query about trade union proposals that it sell gold to fund some of a 37 billion economic stimulus package
9302436 national gold reserves have a confidence and stability building function for the single currency in a monetary union this function has become even more important given the geopolitical situation and the risks present in financial market developments
9302437 the bundesbank is the worlds second largest holder of gold after the us federal reserve and has sold just 20 tonnes out of total reserves of over 3 000 tonnes in the past five years
9302438 these sales were to allow the german finance ministry to mint gold coins unlike the much more active sales programmes of other central banks which wanted to shift their portfolios from gold to a more diverse array of assets
9302439 so much for hope that euro zone growth will improve in q3 data releases from germany today underline the fact that the zones powerhouse economy is flirting with a technical recession and the details of those releases point to negative developments for the euro zone as a whole
9302440 so the bad news is that the euro zone will almost certainly see a second quarter of contraction in q3 with germany france and italy headed that way and spain almost certain to drop into negative territory too the good news is that for now at least it looks as if the zone will stall rather than fall right off a cliff implying signs of recovery could crop up by the end of this year but watch those leading indicators
9302441 any doubts about why russia invaded georgia have now been erased by illegally recognising the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force
9302442 i believe the most potent western response to russia is to stay united and firm by providing immediate material and political support if moscow is trying to overthrow our government using its lethal tools let us resist with democratic tools that have sustained more than 60 years of euro atlantic peace backing georgia with europes political and financial institutions is a powerful response regrettably this story is no longer about my small country but the wests ability to stand its ground to defend a principled approach to international security and keep the map of europe intact
9302443 oao gazprom led a jump in the cost of protecting russian companies from default to the highest in almost five months on investor concern the countrys military incursion in georgia will trigger a rise in borrowing costs
9302444 credit default swaps on the worlds largest natural gas producer increased 36 basis points to 260 this month and moscow based oil pipeline operator oao transneft rose 33 5 to 265 according to at cma datavision contracts on russias government debt climbed 32 to 134 the highest since april 2
9302445 the credit crisis has already prompted a jump in russian corporate funding costs with the nations largest lender oao sberbank increasing rates on outstanding loans by an average of 2 percentage points last month
9302446 access to capital for russian corporations already severely damaged by the global credit crunch has further deteriorated on the back of increased political risks galkin said in an interview today
9302447 the fallout in the uk housing market is gaining momentum and will deliver dramatic knock on effects for the aggregate economy the boe will be forced to respond aggressively
9302448 our uk housing model has been predicting double digit price declines for some time
9302449 in turn the negative wealth effects will continue to mount keeping the consumer depressed and hesitant to spend
9302450 the uk economy stagnated unexpectedly in the second quarter ending the nations longest stretch of economic growth in more than a century
9302451 gross domestic product was unchanged from the previous quarter the office for national statistics said compared with a previous estimate for growth of 0
9302452 the report which showed the biggest drop in investment in 23 years adds pressure on the bank of england to set aside inflation concerns and cut interest rates it also worsens prime minister gordon browns struggle to salvage his reputation for economic competence
9302453 there is still worse to come ross walker an economist at royal bank of scotland said in a bloomberg television interview we may have to wait until early 2009 before we get the first rate cut because the inflation situation still looks pretty forbidding
9302454 industrial production which includes manufacturing as well as utilities and oil and gas extraction has now contracted for two consecutive quarters construction also shrank service industries which range from banks to airlines grew at the slowest rate since 1995
9302455 today the government announced an 11 7 trillion 107 billion set of fiscal measures in response to the weakening economy and likely to the ruling partys low approval ratings
9302456 even though gdp has not contracted for the two consecutive quarters required the worlds second largest economy is showing every sign of recession
9302457 saudi arabias recent decision to allow foreign investors to buy local shares indirectly is a dramatic step toward opening up the biggest stock market in the middle east
9302458 the capital market authority cma the saudi market regulator announced last wednesday that it will let foreigners gain exposure to the local market through so called swap agreements
9302459 the cma will allow authorized persons to enter into swap agreements with non resident foreign investors whether institutions or individuals to transfer profits from shares listed on the saudi stock exchange the tadawul the so called authorized persons will retain legal ownership of the shares
9302460 up until now tadawul has been the least open to foreign investment among the gcc bourses said analysts at kuwait based global investment house in a recent report
9302461 this step is considered a leap in the regulators efforts to diversify the markets investor base and develop the kingdoms financial market the analysts said
9302462 the market is trying to get a sense of what oil will do and how the impact of the tropical storm headed toward the gulf coast is going to influence oil prices over the next week and its dealing with the dell news from last night coming in below expectations
9302463 the decline in personal income makes sense given job losses the slowing economy and that the economic stimulus has been used up
9302464 theres not a heck of lot that you can take away from todays action going into next week it all depends on the storm and how economic data plays out next week
9302465 through july 463 000 jobs have been lost since the beginning of this year if you see a spike in the unemployment rate the markets get pretty concerned
9302466 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9302467 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9302468 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9302469 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9302470 any oil extracted in zanzibar would not be shared with the mainland
9302471 zanzibar is more than just a country it is a phenomenon which has puzzled big and powerful nations for centuries
9302472 you cant compare zanzibar with dar es salaam this is a country
9302473 for its status as part of the tanzania government but not as an individual government
9302474 the dividends and accrued monetary payments which were to be paid to zanzibar were remitted to the treasury of the union government at the heart of these arguments is the question of national identity
9302475 on loan from the bank of england as a technical advisor
9302476 the list of union matters had expanded from the original 11 to 16 including significantly the sixteenth item which was mineral and oil resources including petroleum its relative hydrocarbons and natural gas
9302477 any oil extracted in zanzibar would not be shared with the mainland
9302478 zanzibar is more than just a country it is a phenomenon which has puzzled big and powerful nations for centuries
9302479 it took me about three hours to get home that night
9302480 another time i got stranded at the school during a storm i decided that the commute was not for me
9302481 any maryland farmer who wants to be eligible for disaster assistance on 2009 crops must have insurance coverage on all insurable fall seeded crops before the sales closing deadline
9302482 i urge farmers to talk with their crop insurance agents before the sept 30 deadline for coverage on small grains and forage
9302483 some wish to live within the sound of a chapel bell i wish to run a rescue mission within a yard of hell
9302484 white churches in my neighborhood have been trying to move out to avoid the addicted and the downturn of the community which resulted
9302485 how do we effectively meet the people of our community at their points of need and how do we prioritize those needs in order to be effective at our current church size
9302486 once they were moved to the parking lot they really took off
9302487 it was planned as a test plot but its turned into a lovely display garden
9302488 its multitrunked and has great bark the flowers are a bonus
9302489 crape myrtle for those who have the warm sunny location is clearly hands down the best late summer blooming tree for seattle
9302490 its not like im all in tears about it but the fact of the matter remains that i miss her
9302491 i felt like a moth who got himself too close to the light except i didnt burn i turned cold after that night
9302492 we started with banana trees but they were too much work and looked ratty much of the year
9302493 we added in plants that are exotic looking but truly hardy
9302494 scott gave us a planting plan and we followed some of it
9302495 but now i realize that me doesnt know much about plants
9302496 we needed a graceful way to move from one level to another
9302497 a team from avalon northwest landscaping worked here for months
9302498 scott taught me not to be in such a hurry to plant
9302499 so i place the plants leave them think about it and then move them around
9302500 as we get older our color tastes change the other day i looked out there and decided i needed more fuchsia
9302501 hey look its a bunch of extra random nylon on the other side of the quilt where it shouldnt be

9302575 ada sekelompok orang yang multazim dan berjenggot di negeri kami mereka menyelisihi kami dalam sebagian perkara contohnya puasa romadhon
9302576 wajib mereka berpuasa bersama kaum manusia dan sholat ied bersama kaum muslimin di negeri mereka berdasarkan sabda nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
9302577 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat hilal dan berbukalah berhari raya karena melihatnya
9302578 waktu puasa pada hari mereka berpuasa dan berbuka berhari raya pada hari mereka berbuka berhari raya dan berkurban pada hari mereka berkurban
9302579 kami mendengar dari siaran radio berita permulaan masuknya puasa di kerajaan saudi arabia di waktu kami tidak melihat adanya hilal di negeri sahil al aaj guinea mali dan senegal walaupun telah ada perhatian untuk melihat hilal
9302580 barang siapa diantara kalian yang hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu
9302581 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat hilal dan berbukalah berhari raya karena melihatnya
9302582 tatkala orang orang dahulu dari kalangan para ahli fiqhi berselisih di dalam masalah ini setiap orang diantara mereka memiliki dalil maka jika telah nyata terlihatnya hilal baik melalui radio atau yang lainnya di selain tempatmu
9302583 boleh menggunakan alat alat pengintai teropong untuk melihat hilal namun
9302584 barang siapa diantara kalian yang hadir di negeri tempat tinggalnya di bulan itu maka hendaklah ia berpuasa pada bulan itu
9302585 mereka bertanya kepadamu tentang bulan sabit hilal itu maka katakanlah
9302586 berpuasalah kalian karena melihat hilal dan berbukalah berhari raya karena melihatnya jika ada mendung di atas kalian maka sempurnakanlah jumlah syaban 30 hari
9302587 bagaimana pandangan islam tentang perbedaan hari raya kaum muslimin iedul fithri dan iedul adhha di samping itu telah diketahui bahwa hal itu bisa mengantarkan kepada pelaksanaan puasa pada hari yang haram puasa padanya yaitu hari ied mengantarkan kepada pelaksanaan buka puasa hari raya pada hari yang masih wajib berpuasa di dalamnya kami mengharapkan jawaban yang memuaskan dalam masalah penting ini agar menjadi hujjah di sisi allah
9302588 jika mereka berselisih dalam perkara yang ada diantara mereka maka mereka harus berpegang dengan keputusan penguasa di negara mereka jika penguasanya adalah muslim karena keputusan penguasa ini akan menghilangkan khilaf dan mengharuskan ummat untuk mengamalkannnya jika penguasa bukan muslim maka mereka harus memegang keputusan mejelis islamic centre di negeri mereka demi menjaga persatuan dalam puasa mereka di bulan romadhon dan pelaksanaan sholat ied di negeri mereka

9302766 we have got a specially adapted treadmill that is linked in to a virtual reality system so a little bit like a computer game
9302767 the particularly interesting aspect in terms of the research we are doing here is that we have found that it we manipulate the virtual reality so that people think they are moving slower than they are what happens is that they move faster and better
9302768 they do not realise they are putting any more effort in and they are not feeling any more pain in fact they are less anxious than normal
9302769 they have a better quality of walking so it has huge implications for recovery
9302770 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it
9302771 when like andy people walk with a stick they automatically lean to one side
9302772 this treadmill keeps them upright and enables them to adjust their balance better
9302773 because it is a virtual reality andy can see things on the screen as he is walking along so he is not conscious how slow or fast he is going as his mind is occupied
9302774 on a normal treadmill you have nowhere to look but your feet and that is where people lose their balance
9302775 if he can get to use it on a regular basis he will make great strides
9302776 if this was available maybe three or four years ago he might not be walking with a stick now
9302777 it is just such a fantastic system for helping with rehabilitation

9302788 il popolo venezuelano troppo imbecille per il socialismo non ci sono condizioni di alcun tipo dobbiamo sviluppare le forze produttive assieme ai settori della nostra borghesia per un transito lento al socialismo
9302789 la maggioranza dei professori di economia hanno unidea assai nebulosa del contenuto reale della propria erudizione
9302790 nessuno vuole la crisi tuttavia questa arriva luomo la crea con le proprie mani sebbene non la desideri per nulla al mondo un fatto della vita economica che nessuno dei suoi protagonisti riesce a spiegare

9302797 anche se cercassero di costruire un capitalismo basato sulla borghesia nazionale questi progetti sarebbero irrealizzabili per la dinamica della competizione internazionale che favorisce i capitali pi concentrati

9302801 this is something that i caught onto just before 2002 when there was so much research and exploration going around concerning the human colon and digestive system working in harmony with nutritional absorption and i started doing independent studies just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after seeing some fantastic results
9302802 truly unlocked the keys to permanent fat loss they may actually suffer the same fate as jfk
9302803 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9302804 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
9302805 id be saddened because david is one of my favourite guys on this team
9302806 i was frustrated but i tried to keep that under control
9302807 i knew he was the right guy within 20 minutes of the beginning of his job interview
9302808 we can no longer live we cant be safe anywhere
9302809 i hope those in government do their jobs otherwise they should resign
9302810 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9302811 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9302812 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9302813 are you the guys building that new curling rink in hillcrest park
9302814 we have to be unique and special and spectacular in our own way
9302815 nobody goes to the theatre unless the movies good and the athletes are the movie
9302816 if we dont facilitate the team i think we put ourselves in a place where the games are somewhat more at risk in terms of how canadians will enjoy them
9302817 well be in ontario for easily three weeks we want to capitalize on the iconography of the country so every day is a story unto itself
9302818 when youre fighting a strong dangerous guy every round is going to be on the edge
9302819 these early punches that he took can make a difference late in a fight you dont give nothing for free in boxing
9302820 when i was here in ontario i was carrying the load at the gym there was a lot of pressure on me and plus there was time for me to slack when there was no one there to push me
9302821 when youre the best fighter at your gym everybody improves but you
9302822 hes an awkward fighter hes a hard guy to fight
9302823 hes tall hes rangy he throws weird punches so it will take steves best performance of his life
9302824 im 28 years old im working as hard as ive ever worked its either now or never im not going to pass up this great opportunity that comes once in a lifetime i want to take advantage of it
9302825 when you go into your first game of the year and youre in the situation were in from the standpoint of our placekicker there isnt any question that in the back of your mind is the fact this is a veteran
9302826 the start of every football season anywhere in the world
9302827 its hard going into hamilton hard winning in hamilton theyve got fans that are just nasty out there and were not very ah popular
9302828 theres also been a lot of stuff going on with the argos changes in personnel a lot of pressure on the coaching staff stuff like that
9302829 but we have to ignore all that put everything behind us
9302830 were 3 5 but were saying right now were 0 0 this is when the new season starts
9302831 in the east since ive been around montreals always started out like a race horse
9302832 everybody else kind of jockeys for position then lets it all hang out after labour day
9302833 this time of year despite what out record was our defence was usually playing top of the charts
9302834 now were in the bottom half as far as statistics go and maybe it looks bleaker on the outside than in years past
9302835 but teams have been preparing over the off season they were watching film on toronto figuring thats the defence theyve got to beat
9302836 now weve been making changes to catch up on what offences have been doing to us
9302837 its taken some games to figure that out but we understand now and i really feel this game were going to turn it around
9302838 for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9302839 we all get on streaks where you feel like things are going well and you try to ride it as long as possible
9302840 and i feel like ive been playing some good golf
9302841 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me
9302842 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9302843 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9302844 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9302845 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9302846 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9302847 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9302848 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9302849 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9302850 decidimos reunirnos con ch vez una vez cada dos meses porque si no la burocracia nos limita
9302851 i was born in shreveport louisiana and my parents still live there so i know first hand how hurricanes can disrupt the lives of family and friends
9302852 we want to quickly get the word out to our customers in louisiana and texas who may need to temporarily relocate out of the area and provide them with some relief during this difficult time
9302853 the acquisition and signing of andrej is a strong statement to our players and our fans that the lightning ownership group is committed to putting the best product on the ice now and for years to come
9302854 im extremely happy to be heading to tampa bay and i cant wait to take advantage of this opportunity we should have a great team and i can not wait to get started
9302855 i think that definitely the wimbledon win helped me a lot to change my mentality to realize not every thing has to be perfect all the time
9302856 if i can get my racket on the ball its not too bad
9302857 im a tall guy as well its up near my shoulders where other guys its toward their head against a guy like him theres a sense of urgency to every point especially when hes serving
9302858 i think shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best
9302859 its been crazy but its been fun because in practice you go in and go through all the reps and you try to make all the throws and when you step on the game field everything slows down
9302860 the crowd is loud but you block everything out and you just play ball and im going to get the opportunity tomorrow to just go out and play ball
9302861 bishop is just fitting into the mold that i expected from him
9302862 he has shown the ability and inclination to step in and be a leader he has worked very hard at picking up the offence he has been good on the field athletically mentally and emotionally so hes done the things that i hoped he would do
9302863 sinopec announces that they are no longer considering making an offer for imperial
9302864 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9302865 and it is warm not something im really used to
9302866 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9302867 any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9302868 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
9302869 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
9302870 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
9302871 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
9302872 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
9302873 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
9302874 im afraid that we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9302875 but you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9302876 there is not a scheduling change to speak of tonight but at the white house we are making contingency plans should the president decide against traveling to minnesota for the rnc convention
9302877 the chief executives are sort of the key stars in this party so their presence will be missed here as we get ready to start this convention
9302878 right now the plan is to go forward but obviously this is a serious situation that well be watching
9302879 we plan to start when we were going to start and end when we were going to end
9302880 to postpone a convention is much more difficult than you might think i do believe there are other methods to deal with that potential situation so that we recognize and show the gravity of the situation and still do our business
9302881 alltel takes very seriously our responsibility to ensure our customers stay connected to friends and family during hurricane gustav
9302882 alltel has made significant investments in its wireless network to improve coverage and reliability and we have once again taken all the necessary steps to prepare for gustav
9302883 deben asustarse deben preocuparse y necesitan salir de nueva orleans ya esta es la tormenta del siglo
9302884 hoy se ve m s gente que hace cuatro a os

9302904 continued statements that everything is fine with the 787 global supply network just dont fly
9302905 its time for boeing to stop the lip service and take real action
9302906 face the fact that the global network is a failure and bring the critical work back so the experienced employees can get the 787 back on track
9302907 instead of thanking and rewarding employees for correcting the errors of suppliers and management boeing is banking profits and shifting costs onto employees
9302908 ive been waiting for this since my first year of junior a

9302938 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
9302939 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual las vegas nevada politics award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a las vegas nevada politics project
9302940 i know the academy of las vegas nevada politics design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
9302941 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he las vegas nevada politics industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
9302942 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a las vegas nevada politics industry demonstrate to the general public
9302943 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects
9302944 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our las vegas nevada politics industry can benefit from this special night
9302945 debo decirle que esta es la madre de todas las tormentas

9302982 after attempting to make a beer run in a stolen imperial battle foot the killer robots collided with a piece of space debris and crash landed on earth forced to wait over a hundred years for an essential part the four get part time jobs and start a rock band to pay the bills
9302983 the killer robots played their first show in june of 2005 and quickly became known for their anarchic stage shows and goofball music the killer robots knew they were on to something and organized a guerilla theater troupe for every show they played in order to handle the chaos
9302984 with this guerilla troupe in place the groups well known antics became systematic and organized monsters began to interact with the crowd audience members were given foam weapons with which they could participate in the battle with the monsters candy exploded from the head of monko the gladiator and vicious mosquito while space blob filled with air and threatened to envelope the audience mer monkey and rock lobster battled it out on the floor while trog refereed confetti cannons fired away with the arrival of abraham lincoln
9302985 not necessarily during ramadan it reports did not say when they will launch the attacks but we have information we have received information that they have such plans
9302986 we dont expect them to be religiously observing their practices during the holy month of ramadan
9302987 there is no instruction for us to stop the pursuit operation against the group of bravo and kato because we cannot postpone the enforcement of laws while at the same time there is an instruction to make some tactical adjustments so that our muslim brothers and sisters can observe their religious practices during the holy month of ramadan unhampered
9302988 take for granted the achievements of the women and men who came before them somehow assuming that these were won without the expenditure of huge amounts of emotional and material resources and then skip merrily forward

9303000 una estrategia pol tica que respete totalmente los derechos humanos situ ndonos en par metros puramente pol ticos y dejando a un lado la lucha armada que adem s del sufrimiento que causa cada d a que pasa es m s rechazada por la ciudadan a vasca
9303001 apoyamos su decisi n de no estar de acuerdo con la nueva estrategia pol tico armada ya que no consideramos que una estrategia armada vaya a ofrecer una soluci n al conflicto pol tico que vive euskal herria estamos de acuerdo en que como consecuencia de la estrategia armada se han originado muchas v ctimas de todas las partes constituy ndose en un problema para conseguir una mayor unidad entre los abertzales para remar a favor de la autodeterminaci n
9303002 no tener en cuenta la opini n de la mayor a de presos al romper la ltima tregua
9303003 la lucha armada es in til y un obst culo para la unidad
9303004 en la ltima d cada se han producido cambios e independientemente de las responsabilidades y los errores cometidos por unos y otros
9303005 lo que se est cuestionando dentro de la pol tica abertzale es la idoneidad y legitimidad de la lucha armada
9303006 consideramos que estamos oprimidos por el estado y la propia organizaci n cualquier iniciativa que pueda ser beneficiosa para euskal herria y sus ciudadanos es rechazada poniendo como excusa la persistencia de la lucha armada en este sentido la reciente ekintza acci n contra un trabajador vasco en arrasate mondrag n no se considera el camino apropiado para resolver el conflicto lo que hace que los estados rentabilicen pol tica y socialmente el conflicto armado
9303007 a la dureza de vivir en el exilio se suman las condiciones que tenemos que aceptar los militantes del colectivo al tener limitados nuestros movimientos y no tener permitida la vuelta a euskal herria si no es para reintegrarnos de nuevo en alguna estructura de la organizaci n armada muchos de nosotros llevamos ya m s de 20 a os viendo la crudeza del conflicto y no tenemos derecho a expresar nuestra humilde opini n nos preguntamos si hay que ser monol tico a la hora de pensar o actuar en los ltimos a os ha quedado patente que nuestras reclamaciones no se han tenido en cuenta entre otras cosas debido a que no existen suficientes cauces para hacerlas llegar a nuestros compa eros

9303047 princes who have achieved great things have been those who have given their word lightly who have known how to trick men with their cunning and who in the end have overcome those abiding by honest principles men are so simple and so much creatures of circumstance that the deceiver will always find someone ready to be deceived

9303057 it is essential that the 14 million people aged over 50 who own a mobile phone check their household insurance policy to see if that covers mobile phones
9303058 if they have separate mobile phone insurance they should check the terms and conditions of that too there s no point having two policies to cover the same thing

9303062 dieser sturm ist so kr ftig und gewinnt jeden tag an st rke dass ich nicht sicher bin ob wir so etwas schon jemals gesehen haben

9303064 kein mensch glaubt der spd dann noch dass sie es im bund nicht auch mit den kommunisten machen w rde
9303065 eine vertrauensvolle zusammenarbeit in der gro en koalition kann ich mir so nicht vorstellen
9303066 irgendwann muss es gut sein mit ego trip und machtversessenheit
9303067 in der spd gibt es ein machtvakuum das niemand zu f llen vermag
9303068 wir brauchen eine starke und besonnene europ ische rolle um eine r ckkehr zu vernunft und verantwortung zu erm glichen
9303069 ich finde ein fest des friedens und des sportes in unmittelbarer nachbarschaft eines ortes wo man geschlachtet und einen aggressiven krieg gef hrt hat ist doch eine etwas merkw rdige idee

9303076 man sollte von unserer seite aus nicht so viel in den zwischenfall hineininterpretieren wir waren auch davor nicht pr sent
9303077 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9303078 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9303079 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9303080 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9303081 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9303082 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9303083 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9303084 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9303085 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9303086 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9303087 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9303088 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

9303189 we just keep closing in on that lmp2 championship lead and its very cool
9303190 scott drove an unbelievable first stint he literally drove the wheels off the car and was setting fastest lap after fastest lap he got blocked by traffic and simon pagenaud got by but it was an impressive drive we have the best driver pairing in the series and im thrilled with scott and david now its on to petit le mans and with a lot of points still in play were taking the championship race down to the wire
9303191 the team did a great job and the car performed brilliantly we made some changes just before the race that proved worthwhile the car felt strong and i had a really good race i was conserving fuel and careful through the traffic i was picking up a lot of rubber on my tires due to the nature of the track and the car began sliding around a bit i got blocked on the back straight and simon got by but weve scored great points here today weve been chipping away at the championship gap especially over the last few rounds and now everyone knows we are here and ready for the fight
9303192 im really pleased with this result weve scored two wins and a second place in the last three races so nearly maximum points it all comes down to fantastic work from the patr n highcroft team the car was flying and i was really hustling before we hit the last yellows i had great grip on the michelin tires but that naturally went away during the yellow so i didnt quite have enough to tackle franck montagny at the end we needed to score as many points as possible and we did that today scott drove beautifully to set us up for a great result and overall we are feeling and looking really strong
9303193 we put ourselves in the strongest position possible for the end of the race by making the driver change when we did
9303194 this feels really good with everything that has gone on with this team over the course of the year i m just so happy that we were able to finally get this done i m so happy for every person that works on that team they deserved this
9303195 it is nice having achieved such a good result from such a poor starting position marcel f ssler and emanuele pirro did a great job this also applies to the team which did not have an easy time due to the accidents but was nevertheless able to secure a third place overall and another lm p1 victory
9303196 the track is very difficult i really had my hands full dancing between the walls the traffic was even worse than last time at road america i am very happy emanuele pirro did a superb job the team was great and the tyres were super consistent over the whole distance i am glad to be a part of this team it is great fun
9303197 we can really be happy we did the best we could on a very difficult race track we both did a good race i was very happy with my stint for marcel f ssler it was very difficult our track time before the start of the race was very small but he brought the car home and did a very good job
9303198 congratulations to emanuele pirro and marcel f ssler with their third place they have achieved a good result for audi it was not our weekend we had all the bad luck on our side we knew that it would be difficult for us but the fact that we had so many problems is a shame it s also a shame we were not allowed to repair the car because we know how good audi is in such a situation
9303199 it was a tough weekend we did not have enough track time to do a proper set up the cars were in quite good shape and coming here and finishing third overall is a decent result after all that we experienced this weekend the track did not suit us at all
9303200 we were running second with a good chance to pass the leading acura when a gt2 car moved into the path of timos car as he was trying to position himself for a pass
9303201 unfortunately the final results of the race were decided by the officials not on the track the fans the other competitors and manufacturers would have preferred to see the finishing order decided by the racers not the officials
9303202 it was a very tight race at the beginning with two of our cars and the two leading ferraris nose to tail around the track but then our main rival the tafel farnbacher mueller ferrari broke a starter motor in the pits and the melo salo ferrari had trouble with a door that wouldnt latch and all of a sudden the three lizard porsches were in the lead also with an early fuel stop strategy we were able to maintain our lead late in the race because we didnt need a full tank of fuel on the second stop

9303204 one day youre the windscreen the next day youre the fly the starter motor is the first mechanical failure of the year but it came at a time that it was least welcome however one famous person once said it aint over til its over
9303205 i think my start was very good my goal was to give dirk a good car for the last stint i tried to overtake melo no 62 but it was impossible i was already on the edge he was already on the edge and wolf henzler no 45 in front was on the edge it was like a little train we made there was a lot of action in there i tried to stay out of trouble and let the other two become involved in an incident but it didnt happen i came in and everything worked well dirk got in the car and boom there it was our bad luck that happens but if that decides the championship it would be very sad now we have to take some risk to come back you never know what will happen but i am excited for the next race
9303206 i was just flying out there the car was awesome i had a lot of fun with that i even gained positions in the second to last corner so it really paid off to push to the end i am personally satisfied with the fastest race lap but disappointed for the team we lost a little momentum there is nobody to blame for it i am thankful to the team for the nice race car at the end now we need to look up keep focused and keep pushing
9303207 that was a tough race for sure jim did a great job i think it was one of the best performances i have seen him have i was trying to be a little positive with the prototype and let him know i was in a fight but he had already committed and took off our mirror we had to fix that and that cost us a lot of time i felt like i ran a good pace we bounced off a curb pretty bad and i think we did something to the gearbox or something we were struggling at the end but we stayed in there for a top six so i was excited for that
9303208 i am obviously happy with another top 10 for the no 73 personally i didnt get my times where i wanted or needed them to be it was hard to get the car to turn i think i had a lot of pickup on the tires i just had to keep it off the wall and hand it over to my co driver alex drove another great race and i am looking forward to moving on to atlanta and laguna from here

9303270 why not buy a steel barge from holland as done on grand designs and then build a helsinki log cabin on the deck i think it would be a grand design worth seeing not only would the hull provide additional accommodation but the helsinki itself has four rooms for living in im not sure what the barge itself would cost plus the mooring but the cabin is around 10 000 we can even fit the kitchen and bathrooms as well as the log cabin it could be a very inexpensive way to have a luxury home close to london

9303295 russians also captured another prize five u s marine corps humvees that were providing signals intelligence and electronic warfare assistance to georgian forces along with the humvees and their classified equipment the russians also obtained important and highly classified encryption codes used by the united states and nato to scramble their military and diplomatic communications u s intelligence sources told wmr that the russians obtained an intelligence windfall from the capture of the humvees
9303296 had there been u s citizens inside at the moment of detention
9303297 its hard to believe that washington responded so quickly and brazenly to the loss of only six cars such vehicles burn by the dozen in iraq and the americans dont complain to the resistance there but they feel differently about the jeeps in georgia
9303298 russia is very interested in this incident we believe the pentagon has its reasons for worrying about the humvees we found a great deal of interest in the internal workings of these vehicles and we are continuing to work on that
9303299 it is not accidental the pentagon is so worried about the future of its hummers we have discovered many things of interest to us inside the vehicles
9303300 wed certainly expect that the russians would return any equipment that is u s equipment and return it quickly if in fact they do have it
9303301 the georgian military not only abandoned valuable equipment but essentially blew the lid on the u s security system in gori russian troops seized an american intelligence center packed with cutting edge reconnaissance equipment all of it is in russia now and the six jeeps humvees and landrover are a mobile reconnaissance and patrol complex providing troop management in the field according to our sources the leading cars equipment wasnt the most modern at all and most curiously of all it is produced under license from the usa in odessa ukraine
9303302 another reason why the americans are infuriated is because the georgians have humiliated the usa in front of the whole world the americans trained the georgian army for five years arming them with the latest weapons and hardware but the georgians ran like rats at the first sign of action against russian troops abandoning all their hardware
9303303 the georgians proved unable to effectively fuse intelligence from a range of sources in the chaotic and sometimes panicked atmosphere that followed the russian onslaught
9303304 we have discovered many things of interest to us inside the vehicles
9303305 four georgian craft made two attempts to attack ships of the rfns russian federation navy black sea fleet with the nanuchka class corvettes rfs mirazh and rfs shtyl returning fire and sinking one of the boats

9303352 broader social and business horizons activities and technologies which may once have seemed fairly exotic are now frequent parts of the many divorces we handle
9303353 its important for couples to realise however that they represent how society and tastes are changing just because someone takes up salsa dancing or enjoys spending time with their friends doesnt automatically mean that theyre having an extra marital fling

9303357 this is my first casino computer programmer volunteers award and i will surely treasure it for life i worked really hard and it paid off big time
9303358 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual casino computer programmer volunteers award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a casino computer programmer volunteers project
9303359 i think everyone had a great time we definitely showed the local crowd and the media about the positive forces at work in our industry and this can only help us as we move forward into more aggressive larger projects
9303360 i know the academy of casino computer programmer volunteers design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
9303361 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
9303362 the fact that the selection process for recognition int he casino computer programmer volunteers industry is so complicated demonstrates a lot forethough and consideration for fairness
9303363 and this goes hand in hand with the level of quality we as a casino computer programmer volunteers industry demonstrate to the general public

9303371 the attacks from the obama camp on the american issues project calling upon the justice department to shut us down and calling on stations to succumb to boycotts reminds me of a kind of place weve been blessed not to know a kind of a totalitarian or worse state
9303372 we took the time and effort to back it all up 168 pages of research documents backing up every word in the ad about william ayers his past the bombs he built the people who died because of his efforts he actually had a terrorist group he formed and some of the people that he trained that he helped became part of the weather underground who went on and actually killed police officers and you really get a sense this isnt a guy who kind of smoked a little weed and was upset about the draft this was a guy who said im going to bomb the capitol bomb police stations im going to kill people he was a fugitive from justice in part because he had planned a big bombing of an army office in new jersey and the bomb blew up and killed three of his own gang so he had to go on the lam for ten years it just goes on and on it reads like a movie
9303373 you cant just blow it off so we had our lawyers write back and say look as to whatever is being said weve seen the letter its not true and heres why and were happy to discuss it
9303374 but the department of justice letter we responded and said were doing everything according to the law weve been very careful spent a lot of time and a lot of resources to comply with what are very difficult sometimes complicated beyond belief laws around these things and were just going to plow ahead
9303375 if these arent going to be discussed in any meaningful way by the media issues like william ayers and ones were going to bring up then we think were doing a service and again our goal is to get as much information out there as possible so that people can make informed decisions
9303376 we have yet to decide if were going to continue to run the ad do some more of that ad in other states or if were going to stop and decide to do a different ad were moving slowly but were moving methodically and again hopefully getting lots of people talking about important issues like this one
9303377 the facts are simply this and no one has disputed these facts
9303378 if i served on a board with a guy that said things on 9 11 like i wish wed done more when i was a terrorist like in the 70s i wouldnt stay on that board i would have turned to my fellow board members and said guys what are we doing here i got a reputation i got a wife and kids i care about
9303379 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
9303380 no one has said from the obama campaign ed martin from the american issues project your facts are wrong this isnt true and maybe there are worse parts of this story that were not hearing yet so its a very strange response from the obama campaign but im very grateful because its created an incredible amount of interest across the country and that was our goal from the beginning
9303381 it came from a lot of reaction from myself and other conservatives talking about what was going on and our own fear that people are not being able to understand or pay attention to what sen obama really has done in his life
9303382 sen obama literally has hundreds of millions of dollars that he will spend along with the unions and other left wing groups that have said theyre going to spend hundreds of millions of dollars and in the midst of all that me and some of my colleagues said wait there are some things that are not being discussed they dont appear to be discussed in the mainstream press they dont appear to be noticed lets get together and try to get these issues out there and one of them is this friendship mentor relationship with an admitted terrorist
9303383 we recognized as conservative activists that there was a coming together of some really powerful forces that were going to dominate and will dominate the discourse
9303384 barack obama has decided to bypass public financing therefore he will have hundreds of millions of dollars and access from donors so the sky is the limit at this point
9303385 what were saying is hey we think that theres room for a few million dollars to put out some conservative ideas and i believe one of the reasons the left thinks were coordinated so often is that frankly the left is coordinated and they do a better job of getting on the same page and using each other to promote one effort to move things forward so thats really one of the reasons we decided we had to do this

9303389 were running the ad in a lot of the battleground states
9303390 a lot of the press wanted to look the other way which is frankly what the media has done on a lot of issues for a long time
9303391 he could say i was young i hung out with a guy who was my mentor then i realized he was wrong and i walked away but he didnt walk away or he hasnt answered that so were going to find out

9303593 this has got to be balanced against any big brother concerns with safeguards

9303595 i believe in our quality and i think we got our fans back with this performance
9303596 when we all play together like that and show our spirit we have a chance to win
9303597 it was very important to show that if we play like this we have a lot of chances to win something
9303598 ive been around long enough to know that when the vultures are around it gets difficult
9303599 ive never had it before but you just have to deal with it id rather it was directed at me than the players
9303600 jermain was great the goals were two excellent bits of skill from a top class striker
9303601 we worked hard on our system all week and getting this result should give the players a lot of belief

9303615 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9303616 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9303617 more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9303618 the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9303619 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9303620 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9303621 there is no point in isolating russia but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9303622 i have to accept the responsibility that the biggest contributing to that has been us
9303623 the good sides that play tough football are able to weather that and are able to build pressure again
9303624 that has been the story for us this year we can play good football in patches but doing it for 80 minutes that is the benchmark and that is what all the good teams are doing
9303625 i just said you just have to listen to what he says and it means you have to be fully focused on your job he was sweet with that
9303626 we are going to have to improve a long way on our last road trip
9303627 andrews going to take some time to reflect on whats happened
9303628 hes still committed to playing cricket at the highest level
9303629 how he goes about doing that and how it plays out i dont know whether it means india i dont know
9303630 hes had success there and is a very good player of spin and that is important
9303631 hes not going to be built up with pressure with the spinners where its dot ball after dot ball which is going to be important when we get to india
9303632 hes an integral part of the team a great guy to have around
9303633 but we need him 100 per cent committed to the team and im hoping he can sort out any issues hes got going on in his head and we can have him back asap
9303634 we want to allow him to demonstrate he is committed to doing all those things you need to if youre to be part of the worlds best cricket team
9303635 i would like to say thanks for the many messages of support that i have received over the past day or so i appreciate your best wishes
9303636 ive been asked to think about what is important to me and i will take this time to do that
9303637 i would ask that during this time people respect my privacy and that of my friends and family
9303638 due to the captain being alerted to a vibration in one of the engines
9303639 there was no safety issue at any time and the aircraft continued to frankfurt where it landed without incident
9303640 with what we expect will be a minimum of delay
9303641 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9303642 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9303643 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9303644 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9303645 when some of the media criticises and says that were not well known and so on you have to say why
9303646 but once it gets into a headline then it can become the law but you have to ride over that

9303653 when people are supposed to be submitting itll be abundantly clear how
9303654 i would encourage people sending in their submissions to know that the evil league of evil is no joke its legitimately hard core to get in i would know
9303655 it hasnt been positively identified yet but we believe it may have come from the missing aircraft
9303656 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9303657 its just a normal illness she hasnt visited a hospital or anything like that shes at home in bed just unable to sing
9303658 we were told by winehouses agent at 8pm that she would not be there and we were forced to cancel the performance we have still not been given any explanation of the exact reasons for her absence
9303659 we are very sorry about this situation and share the disappointment of the festival goers
9303660 because of the conditions of this cancellation the festival took the decision to start a judicial procedure
9303661 we both started as child stars and then we also grew up in the business
9303662 im about to marry christian vasquez but we suddenly break up and i get so depressed i go to a bar to forget and i meet john who plays melvin a young man who helps his mom as wedding coordinator we end up spending the night in bed together four years akong nawala and now im back with a vengeance
9303663 no masaya na nga ako ngayon ive moved on matagal ko nang gustong mag come back sa showbiz as i really miss acting kaya lang i couldnt do it then because of my excess weight but now that im slim again ready na ako uli to tackle demanding roles like this one first time ko to do a may december story
9303664 siguro kung hindi ko siya dating kilala na id feel uncomfortable but ive known him since bata pa siya kaya relaxed na akong katrabaho siya
9303665 sa umpisa parang nanibago but if you really love your work hindi naman basta mawawala yung talent mo nandiyan pa rin yan after only a few takes i felt like hindi ako nawala at all and you can ask our director don cuaresma about it kung kinalawang nga ako
9303666 wala theres no need to visit us as they respect our work basta masaya kami ni john sa set as of now my last priority is my affairs of the heart kasi yun ang waterloo ko at ilang beses na ko nagkamali i dont want to get into another relationship again dahil marami pa akong ibang inaayos una pa rin ang mga anak ko ngayon at ang trabaho ko as quezon city councilor and as an actress im now managed by kuya boy abunda and i think maganda ang exposure ko in your song as my comeback vehicle after this ill do an episode in maalaala mo kaya thats a great acting piece theres also an offer to do a movie na entry sa metro filmfest but im not sure yet kung matutuloy
9303667 first movie ko ito with them kaya excited ako lalot sa australia pa isu shoot
9303668 for my role as a cowgirl nag train ako sa horseback riding sa manila polo club one time nahulog ako from my horse buti na lang di ako nabalian at nakabangon ako agad kasi may ganyang accidents na raw noon with christopher reeve who got paralyzed and with amalia fuentes in a movie tulisan na naospital siya after hurting her back kaya nga pina insure na rin kami ni piolo pascual ng star cinema for this movie sabi ko nga wow first time kong ma insure dahil sa isang film project
9303669 i dont know naririnig ko lang sana nga totoo kasi sabi ng lawyer namin si atty joji alonso she read the contract at tapos na raw talaga ang kontrata ko sa regal basta ako malaki ang respeto ko kay mother lily kasi sa kanya ko ginawa ang first movie kong kuya na sinundan ng marami pang pelikula
9303670 okay lang yun di ba may kasabihang absence makes the heart grow fonder so hindi muna kami exlusively dating habang wala ako
9303671 di dapat noon pa sa lobo parang magkapatid lang talaga kami and i really enjoy working with him kasi very caring siyang katrabaho maalaga sa kapareha niya
9303672 ever since very nice ang treatment sa akin ni gov vi and i want to thank her kasi sobrang saya talaga ako for her good words about me i played her daughter na noon in mano po 3 at noong una starstruck pa ako sa kanya kasi idol ko talaga siya but she turned out to be really nice warm and accommodating hindi kataka takang very nice and well bred si luis kasi ganun din ang mommy niya sana nga magkasama kami uli in another movie

9303675 every school gets something out of it thats the key
9303676 theres a power as a 10th grader and an 11th grader having a say on what it should have and what would look nice
9303677 i wish i could go back and be a part of it when all is said and done
9303678 this will be a step forward for the school and the people of the community
9303679 its about improving our facilities to enhance the education of our kids
9303680 were learning through this process how much more well be able to do for our students
9303681 these schools are coming to the end of their life expectancy
9303682 if we can create a new school and make it a wow factor for students then well better motivate them to come stay and do well
9303683 its what we need to do now to get our building into better shape
9303684 once you get past the gut reaction that you shouldnt sell public lands and think about what is really the right thing to do its a no brainer
9303685 if its a whole new school with up to date equipment kids will feel good about going
9303686 id love to see this be the type of school that every kid who doesnt go wishes they did

9303744 its nice once a week to just stop everything and sit and be face to face

9303785 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
9303786 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
9303787 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
9303788 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
9303789 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
9303790 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
9303791 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
9303792 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

9303800 i cant tell you how much im looking forward to that
9303801 i dont have children so i wanted in some way to leave a slightly better place
9303802 there had to be more to life than four gray walls
9303803 they were such great guys and they harpooned fresh fish all we needed was wine or beer and it would have been a perfect night
9303804 if i got really high when things were good then i would get really low when things got difficult
9303805 i learned to become much more accepting about whats happening otherwise you can drive yourself insane
9303806 im developing a strong mind stronger control of my thoughts
9303807 right now the thought of getting back in my boat in six months time lets just say how can i put this
9303808 im going to pack as much fun as i can into the next six months
9303809 but the educational establishment the media government mouthpieces institutional churches and nearly everyone else have mesmerized the working class into thinking that the rich deserve the wealth and income they have

9304015 aqu lo que llama la atenci n es que se trata de personas que ya transitaron por bastantes a os de un proceso de educaci n formal donde se supone que el sistema educativo de los diferentes niveles debi haberlos formados entre otras virtudes y valores con el valor de la honestidad
9304016 es uno de los elementos fundamentales para quien aspira a desarrollarse como un profesionista y me parece que aqu el sistema fall pero tambi n tiene que ver con la formaci n de valores en la familia y ah tambi n algo pas
9304017 en una sociedad que como la nuestra que estamos en una transici n hacia una democracia m s perfecta y desarrollada la honestidad es fundamental
9304018 hasta el momento no tenemos denuncias pero s tenemos identificado el problema si los padres no denuncian nosotros no podemos intervenir y hacer valer un derecho que ellos mismos no est n dispuestos a ejercer en representaci n de sus hijos
9304019 tambi n se busca promover la autogesti n y vinculaci n con las diferentes instancias gubernamentales y sociales para coadyuvar con la autoridad educativa en beneficio de la comunidad escolar
9304020 el cese es tajante representa la culminaci n de la relaci n laboral
9304021 es un ainjusticia lo que est n haciendo con el director
9304022 en nuestra escuela no se cobraron cuotas nosotros acordamos nuestras propias cuotas voluntarias en efectivo especie o mano de obra seg n las posibilidades de las familias
9304023 indiscutiblemente tendremos que plantear de cara a la sociedad que la educaci n es tarea de todos necesitamos ayuda de los empresarios compartir experiencias desde la educaci n superior con b sica y queremos m s recursos que se trasladen a la calidad educativa
9304024 solamente transparentando el manejo de las cuotas porque los recursos no los manejan los maestros sino las asociaciones de padres de familia y hay que regularlo bien transparentarlo porque s lo as nos vamos a evitar conflictos
9304025 indiscutiblemente tendremos que plantear de cara a la sociedad que la educaci n es tarea de todos necesitamos ayuda de los empresarios compartir experiencias desde la educaci n superior con b sica y queremos m s recursos que se trasladen a la calidad educativa
9304026 solamente transparentando el manejo de las cuotas porque los recursos no los manejan los maestros sino las asociaciones de padres de familia y hay que regularlo bien transparentarlo porque s lo as nos vamos a evitar conflictos
9304027 estamos de acuerdo en que los padres de familia nos apoyen pero no que se les llame a las cuotas como si fuera un cobro sino que lo hagan dentro de sus posibilidades
9304028 el gobierno del estado y los diputados dar n la soluci n
9304029 confi en que no sea una tarea de persecuci n
9304030 no estamos de acuerdo en que los hayan cesado y vamos a buscar su defensa sin que signifique que estemos de acuerdo en el condicionamiento de las cuotas
9304031 yo le digo al gobernador que si de verdad quiere cesar a los maestros por sostener las escuelas el primer error fue que no hubo antes di logo con el sindicato por lo que en agosto vamos a convocar a todos los directores para que participen y expongan en que condiciones est n operando si es que les llega el apoyo institucional y si los insumos que reciben son deber s buenos
9304032 perseguir a los formadores de valores y de conciencias de nuestros ni os por parte del gobernador de la educaci n entonces no es congruente tomo una decisi n pol tica que se puede arreglar antes de que pase el tiempo que a la mejor en agosto se tendr a que realizar por eso hago responsable al gobierno del estado de lo que pase al iniciar el ciclo escolar pero espero que antes que llegue el ciclo se llegue a un buen acuerdo de trabajar juntos
9304033 esos directores van hacer cesados y ya le ped al sindicato que ni las manos metan por ellos
9304034 estamos un esfuerzo muy importante para que ning n joven se quede sin espacio fundamentalmente con cecyte y cobach donde estamos identificando las reas de mayor demanda para plantear extensiones es decir que los subsistemas puedan trabajan en una secundaria o en alguna escuela de otro nivel por ejemplo en el turno vespertino y poder atender a los j venes
9304035 creemos que podemos atender a todos tenemos ser responsables y utilizar la infraestructura al m ximo hom
9304036 supe que el reclamo de ella es en el sentido que los expedientes est n fundados en derecho y quiero decirles que as estamos actuando
9304037 con el incremento de recursos no habr ning n pretexto
9304038 como parte de los instrumentos de difusi n que el see puso en marcha en d as pasados para que los padres de familia y ciudadan a en general se enteren que del 1 al 15 de febrero se llevar a cabo el periodo de inscripciones a educaci n b sica
9304039 es un tema que no operar en el estado por lo menos en este a o
9304040 el reto ahora es que la escuela se vuelva en centro de las comunidades la propuesta es que los alumnos del sector b sico escolar tengan m s horas clases con contenidos no s lo en ciencias sino en actividades f sicas creemos que es mejor que pasen este tiempo en las escuela y no en sus casas viendo la televisi n o en las calles donde pueden aprender conductas delictivas
9304041 existe la voluntad de los trabajadores la escuela de tiempo completo se puede empezar a implementar en los centros escolares que no tengan turnos vespertinos
9304042 lo m s importante es que en los niveles de primaria y secundaria es tener a los padres juntos con el estudiante inculc ndoles que la nica forma de salir adelante es a trav s del trabajo
9304043 he conocido a empresarios exitosos que tuvieron una educaci n precaria
9304044 qued claramente establecido con el director de issstecali que no hay ninguna reforma ni mucho menos un intento de la misma y si la hubiera cualquier situaci n ser a platicada con el sindicato y con el congreso del estado
9304045 no haremos ninguna negociaci n a espaldas del trabajador y ah vamos a estar para defenderlos
9304046 a nivel nacional est n comprometidas 5 mil escuelas en baja california son 150 planteles de los dos niveles educativos y divididas en 75 de la secci n 2 e igual n mero en la secci n 37 que corresponden 21 a la regi n de ensenada y san quint n
9304047 durante dos semanas que permanecieron en el curso fueron atendidos por 87 maestros frente a grupo 15 intendentes 30 profesores de educaci n f sica seis de usaer seis talleristas de la casa de la cultura y cuatro docentes de ingl s
9304048 nadie piensa donde todos lucran nadie sue a donde todos tragan
9304049 aunque este es un tr mite cuyo proceso se encuentra a cargo de las dependencias y el issste en corresponsabilidad toca a la organizaci n sindical recordar a sus agremiados sobre los plazos a vencer para cumplir con este proceso y orientar a quienes tengan dudas sobre el mismo
9304050 no tendr costo alguno para los que quieran inscribirse y podr n hacerlo todos aquellos ni os y j venes que est n en nivel primaria y secundaria estatales y federales
9304051 no es justo que grupos de personas que se dedican a vandalizar escuelas se roben las cosas y eso merma las finanzas del see porque tenemos que reponerlas

9304171 our objective for project t day is to send birthday presents for our dear maknae taemins birthday on july 18th but of course we cant just leave out the rest of our shinee boys so we will also be sending them a gift s as congratulatory debut presents
9304172 the purpose of this is to show shinee that they do in fact have fans all over the world
9304173 the rules each player answers the questions about themselves at the end of the post the player then tags 5 6 people and posts their names then goes to their blogs and leaves them a comment letting them know theyve been tagged and asking them to read your blog let the person who tagged you know when youve posted your answer
9304174 its okay to be weak and cry sometimes as long as you try your best youll be able to do anything
9304175 certainly there are a number of great players that elect to play at the tier two level and we can watch many of them on tv on hockey night in canada but i was surprised at how big a jump it is on the ice i think the play is considerably better to a man the players are better i think the coaching across the league is stronger and i think that you see that in the systems play the tactical play and the puck movement skills of the players which just really makes the game faster better and more pro like then what you see at the tier two level
9304176 from a pure coaching standpoint it is the same your influence is however actively you chose to run a team and the systems that you choose to implement the players at both levels are very capable in terms of being coachable instructing them to play systemically and team tactics i think that with those things that whatever you bring to the table as a coach you have the opportunity to utilize those skills
9304177 at the tier two level when you are a general manager because there is no draft you have the ability to shape your own team in terms of personnel a little bit more directly and make changes more quickly and the turnover year to year is significantly greater teams fortunes can literally change overnight and season to season you can see big changes in on ice talent at this level with the draft and with the scouting staffs that are in place as a coach you are really dealt a hand that you need to play from that scouting staff and from the people that you put around you i would say that there is far less turnover from year to year so change from a rebuilding program to a competitive program to a championship program i think as we have seen very much here in swift current it is a longer process you need to spend more time to work with your younger players on development and getting them up to speed quickly and the wholesale changes that you can see at the tier two level just arent a reality here
9304178 it is a big adjustment to go from being the head guy and the key decision maker to being in a support role i think the opportunity to work with dean has been tremendous for me he is guy that brings a lot of experience and a guy that i have learned a great deal from already in just a year being in a support role brings its own challenges particularly when you are used to being in charge for a few years i think that ultimately i will be a much better head coach when that opportunity comes along because of this experience as an assistant i think that it really brings to the floor how you are utilizing your support staff how best you can utilizes those people and how best to utilize your entire group
9304179 a lo que su marido antequerano l le replic r pidamente
9304180 i took about two weeks off and then got back at it and just trained hard got a little bit bigger and a little bit heavier
9304181 it feels good to come back knowing guys and being that much more comfortable you can play your game and not worry about trying to impress the guys on the team it help being nice to the younger guys on the team i try and be as supportive as i can telling them they made a good pass or whatever
9304182 i am hoping to get more ice time and get into more games or hopefully all of them i need to play the big guy role take the body hit maybe get in a couple of fights here and there trying to look out for my teammates if anything happens
9304183 we might end up losing some more guys which would make for some more rookies but i think that we should be pretty good and have a solid season just like last year we have to follow up on that season because it was a really good one
9304184 i think that i did pretty good i kept up with the play got rid of the puck quickly and just did what i had to do
9304185 i started out the camp a little more conservative just because i didnt really know what to expect this last game i felt more comfortable and i jumped up in the play a bit more
9304186 obviously the strength and speed is quite a bit different here then it is in midget and bantam so those are the two main things that i have to work on
9304187 i think that camp went well and everybody has been doing really well myself i am just trying to do my best and play my position and do what got myself here
9304188 i am just trying to be a stay at home d man get that first pass off and get off the ice i am not trying to be offensive i am just trying to stay at home
9304189 yeah i think that it has picked up i thought early on the young kids were nervous and the older guys were kind of taking advantage of that obviously we expect the older guys to shine through in those situations but i thought that some of young kids came on as the days progressed then obviously to get down to the 42 or 44 guys for this game some of it is obviously a reward for some of the young guys of how their camp has gone and also to send them home in a good frame of mind
9304190 the recent drafted guys i thought have had a strong showing from reece scarlett who if he wasnt 15 he could probably be here right now he does a lot of things well and is a tremendous thinker who doesnt get himself in too many bad situations jordan evans is a young d man who has had a very strong camp allistair chapman is another 16 year old d man who has had a very strong camp along with james martin who is in that group who are going to compete for those last spots on defense
9304191 not really we have a lot of things to sort through over the next two or three weeks and as the camp progresses we will get to see guys more individually in practices and when we get into the edmonton and saskatoon tournaments that will decide some of the young guys fate

9304217 the results indicated that home learning environment pre school effectiveness and primary school effectiveness all make separate significant impacts
9304218 the mothers educational attainment is the strongest effect theres no doubt about that but home and school and pre school environments are also important
9304219 and there are quite a few well educated people who do not provide a good home learning environment
9304220 theres been chatter about dancing for next year definitely shes keen on that the daily telegraph quoted the source said
9304221 its obviously dependent on her schedule but both she and the network are keen at this point in time
9304222 were not a couple yet theres no reason for speculation were just really good friends
9304223 it is one of the more unusual things we have had to rescue an animal from
9304224 young cows are quite curious and she probably thought there was some food inside the drum
9304225 most people hate to see fly tipping as it is an ugly blight on the landscape but incidents like these highlight that as well as the visual impact the rubbish can also endanger animals
9304226 the heifer was probably curious to see a new item dumped in the field and curiosity would have turned to panic once she got her head stuck in the drum and was unable to get it out
9304227 if people disposed of their rubbish properly many animals would be saved from injury and death
9304228 a large proportion of the injuries the societys inspectors animal collection officers vets and wildlife hospitals deal with are caused by carelessly discarded rubbish and fishing litter

9304232 we talked about how grateful we were to be there with mda affecting so many lives across the country and showing our support by making a pledge

9304236 windblown jackie is the one image that sums up my career because she considered herself private and did not seek publicity
9304237 she generally ignored me and my camera and rarely went to public events this left me no choice but to photograph her on the run she made me a paparazzo on my letterhead it says photography with the paparazzi approach which refers to the qualities i look for ideally exclusive off guard spontaneous unrehearsed windblown jackie possesses these qualities with natural soft light over the shoulder composition no make up or hairdo and a mona lisa smile reflecting beauty from within
9304238 the new generation of celebrities i call them featherweights are celebrity trash they have been overexposed by the media and we know too much leaving little to our imaginations and thereby losing the mystery that creates glamour jackie whispered and was never obvious today they rely on sex and vulgarity to gain the attention of the media
9304239 liz taylor she has always been nice to me even after i sued her she had been trained by the studios to be nice to the press and most of all she was beautiful lauren hutton who said more than once i like your work more than dick avedons i think its because i shoot fast as stars are being themselves whereas studio photographers fuss around posing them sophia loren again shes beautiful and had said that she didnt believe i was a paparazzo i believe she is right robert redford who allowed me to shoot him and his family in his lobby and elevator warren beatty who would talk to me when i called him at the beverly wilshire hotel
9304240 marilyn monroe is the one celebrity i wish i had photographed i had one opportunity in 1957 when she was filming bus stop at 20th century foxs lot but i was preoccupied with shooting a no name actor and did not wait for marilyn at her trailer i was not a paparazzo at the time

9304247 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9304248 thirty eight million people watched barack obama at the stadium in denver
9304249 john mccains vp pick is the governor of alaska a unknown hockey mom named sarah palinthat no one ever heard of the only other job she had in politics was the mayor of a small town known as wasilla alaska and now she has the opportunity to be on a ticket opposite of barack obama the first black man shes ever seen
9304250 this isnt a presidential ticket this is a sitcom the maverick and the milf
9304251 are you kidding me the mayor of wasilla alaska yeah thats who you want in the white house during a time of crisis when she got a phone call at 3 in the morning it was because a moose had gotten in the garbage can
9304252 i think this is pertinent because mccain has been running this campaign based on were at war its a dangerous world out there
9304253 when they were vetting her for this job like three seconds ago she said quote im not making this up what is it exactly that the vp does every day let me field that for you sarah they start wars they enrich their friends they subvert the constitution and they shoot people in the face thats what the vice president does
9304254 the mccain people believe that americans will disregard her inexperience because they will fall in love with her story she was a runner up in the 1984 miss alaska pageant which may sound trite but you try walking in high heeled snow shoes
9304255 and the trump card why americans will fall in love with her shes got five kids how can you not vote for someone who has five children including an infant some touching details about the infant it has down syndrome she had it when she was 43 years old and it looks a lot like john edwards
9304256 shes not bad looking she looks like one of those women in the van halen videos who takes off her glasses shakes out her hair and then all of a sudden shes in high heels and a bikini all of a sudden i am for drilling in alaska
9304257 not only is she young theyre saying shes the prettiest candidate for vice president since john edwards
9304258 there was some breaking news out of dayton ohio today where republican presidential candidate john mccain introduced the world to his third wife
9304259 now obviously sen john mccain has made an enormous amount over barack obamas lack of experience so it seems curious that the 72 year old four to five time face cancer guy would choose a running mate whose resume appears to be more suited for a northern exposure reunion show
9304260 alaska gov sarah palin is john mccains choice heres what we know about her her name is sarah palin
9304261 actually it was kind of a smart choice mccain went with a woman because he didnt want to have to be in a position to have to get cpr from mitt romney
9304262 palin and mccain are a good pair shes pro life and hes clinging to life
9304263 president bush called gov palin and congratulated her bush told palin the job of vice president is very important because as vice president you get to tell the president what to do
9304264 i just hope he can get the help that he needs

9304267 young women and girls are increasingly spending more money and going to unhealthy extremes to achieve an unattainable image of physical perfection
9304268 were desperate weve been fighting for five years we want an answer
9304269 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9304270 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9304271 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9304272 this is the real deal this is not a test
9304273 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9304274 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9304275 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok

9304277 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9304278 thank you president mubarak for letting us return home before ramadan
9304279 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9304280 time and time again americans have demonstrated unmatched compassion and generosity helping millions of people around the world who experienced major hardships
9304281 its hard to imagine a greater humanitarian cause than helping our own u s military families who personally suffer from lasting wounds of war thousands are struggling with major financial problems that we cannot count on our government to solve
9304282 i was on a mission to close the gap on the ford team but got onto the wrong part of the road on a long left hand corner and had the spin
9304283 i wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over and wed lost the chance but then it all changed and we were leading again
9304284 this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9304285 i needed to win for sure and thats very nice but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but its a race and these things happen sometimes
9304286 i was really confident that we were going to win this rally but what could we do
9304287 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third but im not going to let this knock my confidence
9304288 i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again on the next rallies
9304289 we want to win not get fourth im sorry but were not here for fun we have to improve the speed
9304290 how did such a film get into the competition for the golden lion
9304291 without suspense which ends up irritating the spectator trapped in a cerebral and weak willed farce
9304292 despite some refreshing and surreal touches of humour the tone seems uselessly gratuitous
9304293 with these celebrities exhaustion sometimes means something else and a little rest at a spa sometimes actually translates into something a little more serious
9304294 its just been heartbreaking for her parents to watch britney on this downward spiral
9304295 it looked like they were just happy and having a good time and listening to the speeches
9304296 ive never participated in politics before other than just voting so im just learning how this will go
9304297 when you have a fair shot at winning people pay attention
9304298 we were going through the motions then but you knew in your heart bill clinton would be re elected
9304299 senator mccain has been a strong person in cutting pork and stuff thats not needed
9304300 theres not a high percentage of republicans locally but we just try to do the best we can
9304301 as we wrap up another adventure filled year and turn our attentions to all those year end activities and festivities that can be so all encompassing in many ways i think its also important to once again take a moment to remind ourselves that we should be very grateful that we have all been exceedingly fortunate to be a part of a
9304302 this is not the end it is not even the beginning of the end but it is perhaps the end of the beginning
9304303 letters from the past hearts scattered on the floor what do you mean whos gonna pick this up letters flowers and smiles who was the real friend the one who said the things you needed but not wanted to hear u still stubborn til the end my mistake to tell u of the future it was too much to know too soon to understand u burned the words written i should have never sent you bigger matches but when the music came it was magical as you still are not enough stars in the sky to rate this guy
9304304 the energy was chart topping for britney her group and the club
9304305 she went into a dead faint and just fell right to the floor
9304306 she was being dragged as she wasnt walking under her own speed
9304307 it looked as if they wanted to get her up to her hotel room as soon as possible

9304327 georgians stand next to the body of their son in the town of gori
9304328 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over we would have a serious problem if we took it to parliament right now
9304329 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9304330 he was just a feisty individual very independent and people wanted to follow him it was in his dna
9304331 he has unique leadership qualities and i think a big part of that came from his family tradition
9304332 weight of the family legacy and he did not want to disgrace that but he wanted to do things on his own terms
9304333 you saw it when his campaign imploded last year and he kept going you cant keep the guy on the mat
9304334 he didnt put any effort in it nobody was as sloppy as john
9304335 i embarked on a four year course of insubordination and rebellion
9304336 that was unheard of then and could have gotten him thrown out it was an act of moral courage
9304337 anger is a powerful tool of leadership in the military or politics
9304338 because he was just a very persuasive guy and fun to be around
9304339 we knew theyd throw his butt out so we held a lottery to see who would take the blame
9304340 that in its antique way had labored to impress upon me
9304341 he was neither infatuated with nor intimidated by rules and that quality helped him as a prisoner of war
9304342 he turned out to be more longsighted a shrewder strategist a more sophisticated legislator than had been generally thought
9304343 senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
9304344 i wouldnt think the john mccain i know would accuse an opponent of lacking patriotism but thats what he has been saying
9304345 during a time when gas prices are high and we need to look at all options to issue something that shuts off a viable resource

9304364 the shell fired by the sri lanka army fell inside one such piece of land where three families had put up small shelters
9304365 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9304366 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9304367 more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9304368 the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9304369 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9304370 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9304371 there is no point in isolating russia but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9304372 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast

9304379 the right of the people to keep and bear arms
9304380 the idea is to allow talented young cricketers the option of completing their high school education
9304381 and the option of adopting cricket as a profession or completing full education and becoming useful citizens
9304382 but the educational establishment the media government mouthpieces institutional churches and nearly everyone else have mesmerized the working class into thinking that the rich deserve the wealth and income they have
9304383 of the growing frustration in this state as more and more people lose purchasing power or see their homes go into foreclosure or lose their jobs
9304384 they are happy there are wealthy people out there and they would like to become wealthy themselves
9304385 many in the legislature suffer from what i call the east berlin syndrome
9304386 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million but seriously
9304387 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
9304388 the income goes to the wealthy perhaps the taxes should as well
9304389 one day you look in the mirror and you realize that the face you are shaving is your fathers

9304394 for his shrunk shank and his big manly voice turning again toward childish treble pipes and whistles in his sound last scene of all that ends this strange eventful history is second childishness and mere oblivion sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything
9304395 she is very affectionate and loving even though she has been patiently waiting for over a month and a half at the animal shelter in watsonville for her new family to come adopt her and give her the loving home she deserves
9304396 she is smart and will pick up training quickly she does not seem to have an aggressive bone in her body ivory is definitely a staff favorite
9304397 he falsified the entire thing in order to obtain the identification in a different name other than his true name
9304398 the government has the duty to safeguard the credibility of any sort of identification thats obtained through them
9304399 were happy with the intelligence that weve gathered and information thats come to light through the course of the investigation
9304400 apparently we helped because we help with these things sometimes
9304401 it looked like they were just happy and having a good time and listening to the speeches
9304402 ive never participated in politics before other than just voting so im just learning how this will go

9304423 ive never had this crowd this feeling in the air
9304424 het is mijn doel om dit seizoen meer dan tien goals te maken
9304425 dat soort doelen is cruciaal om verzekerd te zijn van motivatie op persoonlijk niveau en op teamniveau
9304426 ik heb de laatste twee jaar tien goals per seizoen gemaakt het is dus mijn doel om dat te overtreffen
9304427 ik moet toegeven dat ik niet veel weet over z rich maar de tegenstander hoeft ons niet te motiveren dat doet het strijden om de uefa cup wel we willen deze prijs winnen zodat we volgend jaar rond deze tijd spelen tegen de champions league winnaar

9304435 he was just a feisty individual very independent and people wanted to follow him it was in his dna
9304436 he has unique leadership qualities and i think a big part of that came from his family tradition
9304437 weight of the family legacy and he did not want to disgrace that but he wanted to do things on his own terms
9304438 you saw it when his campaign imploded last year and he kept going you cant keep the guy on the mat
9304439 he didnt put any effort in it nobody was as sloppy as john
9304440 i embarked on a four year course of insubordination and rebellion
9304441 that was unheard of then and could have gotten him thrown out it was an act of moral courage
9304442 anger is a powerful tool of leadership in the military or politics
9304443 because he was just a very persuasive guy and fun to be around
9304444 we knew theyd throw his butt out so we held a lottery to see who would take the blame
9304445 that in its antique way had labored to impress upon me
9304446 he was neither infatuated with nor intimidated by rules and that quality helped him as a prisoner of war
9304447 he turned out to be more longsighted a shrewder strategist a more sophisticated legislator than had been generally thought
9304448 senator obama would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign
9304449 i wouldnt think the john mccain i know would accuse an opponent of lacking patriotism but thats what he has been saying

9304504 the extra supply of crude to the market has had an impact on prices it is not only saudi arabia that has an increase in supply but a rise of supply by some other members can also have an impact

9304544 the maoists were raising donation from vehicles plying the koshi highway but they did not allow us to raise the fund which resulted in fighting
9304545 the us india civil nuclear deal would not be the end of moving the us indian relationship forward well do more work on that and so will the next secretary of state
9304546 you have to tend your relationships with countries it is important to make certain that you are seeing your key allies on a regular basis even if there is no particular crisis or work to be finished in that particular business
9304547 but if you can conclude something like that the nuclear deal youve pushed it to the next level and im always looking for the work that you can conclude to push something to the next level push your relationship to the next level
9304548 we set out at the beginning to try and improve extend broaden and deepen the us india relationship because very early on the president george w bush and i both saw it as an emerging big democracy and the relationships never been very close
9304549 and you can do all of the kind of small things you know not small things but expected new agricultural cooperation new cooperation between businesses
9304550 and so setting out to do that then puts the relationship on a completely different level
9304551 we really started pursuing the india civil nuclear deal in 2005 so there was a period of getting to know the relationship and building on what had been there before
9304552 but i think we knew from 2001 2002 that eventually that was going to have to be an issue but we built to it slowly it didnt start with the big stepwise function
9304553 people believe the government has come out with the announcement only to divert their attention from various problems including the power cuts indirect hiking of bus fares and the general increase in the prices of essential commodities and others

9304563 the penn state researcher summarizes research showing that parents verbal interaction with their preschool children explains much of the early test score differences between children of different social class and racial backgrounds he emphasizes that reducing the test score gap must begin early with increased verbal interaction between parents and children

9304566 phase ii training a done deal and our life vision
9304567 the key difference between climate models and economic models is that economic models include volition human choice
9304568 uncertainty about outcomes should make us worry more not less
9304569 economic models aside economic empirics give us every reason to believe that apart perhaps from environmental issues todays mixed economies with democratic capitalism have produced and will continue to produce entirely satisfactory outcomes
9304570 so long as we disregard the predictions of the imminent collapse of the global systems that sustain our basic needs and provide the free services that our extractive economy depends upon everything is working fine carry on

9304577 but heres my understanding of obamas central thesis if funds could be diverted from corporate profits into the above wish list then america would be better off
9304578 i agree with the senator that there is some waste in the federal budget however id caution against overstating the magnitude of what we should expect to achieve
9304579 politicians who break their word violate their ideals and do not follow through on their promises
9304580 open up the hood and get in there and fix the countrys problems
9304581 now see the federal government is like a giant pot of piss sure everyone wants to fill it up but no one wants to stick his head in and drink
9304582 surely palin knew that having a down syndrome baby would be a credibility indicator so that makes her decision less of a true credibility indicator it seems plausible that she wanted to abort the baby but didnt because it could help her career and because of the risk that someone might find out about her abortion which could be devastating to her as a pro life politician
9304583 i havent seen anyone mention that perhaps palin bears some responsibility for the child having down syndrome in the first place doesnt the risk go up drastically when the mother is in her late 30s she was 44 when the baby was born
9304584 if only for this reason she will be seen as a candidate who stands on principle
9304585 teach both you know dont be afraid of education healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9304586 i havent seen anyone mention that perhaps palin bears some responsibility for the child having down syndrome in the first place doesnt the risk go up drastically when the mother is in her late 30s she was 44 when the baby was born
9304587 as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9304588 we commend this historic moment of governor palin becoming the second vp candidate in american history and look forward to the vigorous issue based campaign to come
9304589 maybe a soccer mom wouldnt be such a bad person to have there as vp

9304594 you dont have to do a stupid thing like that to disrespect the game i let him know i didnt appreciate it
9304595 making the simple complicated is commonplace making the complicated simple awesomely simple thats creativity
9304596 good thats what ive been hoping for something like that
9304597 i kind of figured that after two years of nothing happening
9304598 i argued with them and told them no you got the wrong person
9304599 if i just sit here long enough somethings going to happen
9304600 as best i can ascertain the judge issued an order saying if the defense complied with certain conditions the defendant would be bonded out and no response was ever made to that order
9304601 surely it seems that if you were sitting in jail and you thought you had some opportunity to be released you would be a very active advocate on your own behalf
9304602 and so it wasnt incumbent on us at that point to do anything
9304603 what you look for is are there any deadlines i have to meet
9304604 were advocating that he has his rights represented i mean our mission is to do justice we think he should be convicted but were supposed to uphold the law
9304605 whether he committed a crime or not two years is gone with nothing being done
9304606 we didnt know if it was a bomb we didnt know if it was chemical we didnt know exactly what was going on
9304607 ro corp is a packaging repackaging facility for dry materials bulk storage rail access milling and dry blending are among the services available at this site
9304608 the situation has been isolated and contained and we know where the substance is
9304609 if its the sort of chemical that can kill if you touch it then no we dont want that in our community
9304610 they came in and all of a sudden they put this quarantine thing up nobody knew what was going on
9304611 its the uniqueness of a spread offense there are a lot of different things that happen and thats one reason we went to it you can run the ball well with the offense if you choose and there are a lot of different ways to throw the ball
9304612 its the uniqueness of a spread offense missouri coach gary pinkel said
9304613 there are a lot of different things that happen and thats one reason we went to it you can run the ball well with the offense if you choose and there are a lot of different ways to throw the ball
9304614 although they run the option and are pretty good at it chase has made his mark as a thrower and a very accurate guy theyre different from us in that regard but they can run it just like we can throw it
9304615 coach pinkel would say the offense is only as good as what your quarterback can do daniel said
9304616 brad could run so wed run 40 50 times a game with me or chase patton or blaine gabbert were not brad so were going to throw more and hand the ball to our running backs more this year
9304617 in high school i was always part of a spread offense williams said
9304618 it was a way to go out and show off my arm and legs at the same time we do some of everything and having an athletic quarterback you have so many options thats the strength of our offense
9304619 we even prepare for stuff we havent seen before and generally were going to see something we havent seen i guarantee theyre going to do something
9304620 shes a complete package right on all the issues particularly pro life and drilling for more oil
9304621 conservatives have to leave st paul excited and pleased as much as i know john mccain is a conservative there are others who dont believe that
9304622 is more related to his opponent than him but one day hell reach out and on another day hell pull back
9304623 will they go out and do that for him i think that more of them would today than when he locked up the nomination but there is still a lot of room for improvement
9304624 when it gets down to one on one combat between obama and mccain and the question of which one they want in the white house my hope is that the convention will be more than just hoopla and that it will be able to further clarify the differences
9304625 truly establishes this ticket as a reform ticket and probably does so better than any other potential vice presidential candidate he could have picked i am as certain as i have ever been that the republican base is going to turn out for this ticket
9304626 very similar to huckabee i think conservatives are wonderfully invigorated in these first few hours according to what im sensing and hearing
9304627 the party needs to turn around this narrative about how the youths dont care about the republican party
9304628 maybe mccain should pull out an iphone during his speech and make a joke about it
9304629 i would love to be a republican but they dont speak to me
9304630 i dont want a campaign focused entirely on obama that would be a train wreck and i think they would lose if they do that i would love to see mccain focus on what is great about this country
9304631 its why our game is the way it is where the best in the game are successful 30 percent of the time
9304632 thats probably something ill keep to myself and maybe when im done playing ill explain
9304633 you see teams like the red sox theyre patient and wait for their pitches and know what a strike looks like
9304634 its devastating we played them twice last year and our pitchers were out there battling every inning it makes it a lot tougher guys like kevin youkilis its almost like they control the at bat rather than the pitcher having the ball in his hand and controlling it when those guys are hitting they dont know what to throw
9304635 its progressing really at an alarming rate and now youre expecting injuries to happen every day
9304636 weve certainly noticed its almost commonplace that guys are getting hurt
9304637 when you get a slight tweak in the elbow you definitely heal faster than the person whos not on it if you take that stuff away you may see more injuries
9304638 as those chemicals get out of the game its not surprising theres an initial leap in injuries

9304681 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like it
9304682 this is the real deal this is not a test for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9304683 i dont want to be stuck like i was in katrina
9304684 new orleans will be impacted but to what degree we dont know
9304685 potential for a significant storm surge we dont know how much or where
9304686 its just like rita its more of a rural storm than an urban storm
9304687 the system itself is stronger than it was before katrina
9304688 weve made great strides but were not there by any stretch of the imagination
9304689 with a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9304690 we believe that under all the criteria that have been put forward we now have made thoroughly the case that i must be included
9304691 we have established ourselves as a party that cannot be described as fringe
9304692 we are a party whose ideas and policies are now in the mainstream
9304693 if they decide not to allow me in the debates what theyre really doing is telling voters dont take that party seriously
9304694 ms may and mr dion have an agreement for electoral co operation you cant have two candidates from essentially the same party in the debate
9304695 obama must know that raising taxes in this weak economy is a bad idea
9304696 but he refuses to buck his political backers and partys ideological drive to raise taxes
9304697 cutting pork barrel spending or popular government programs is one of the hardest political tasks
9304698 every candidate promises to cut waste few have ever delivered
9304699 global capital will come to the united states to create good jobs not because our taxes or wages or regulatory costs are low there will always be places around the world where taxes wages and regulatory costs are lower but because the productivity of our workers is high
9304700 counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them
9304701 the health of our children the quality of their education or the joy of their play
9304702 unfortunately the modot culture is imbedded with a lot of traditional thinking that frequent mowing is good you need to have low vegetation
9304703 in the past decade more and more states are seeing the benefit of native flowers that add beauty and reduce mowing especially in this time of high gas prices
9304704 including some that are commonly used in highway right of ways
9304705 one other thing modot crews like to talk about is safety zones they dont want deer lurking and waiting to jump out but other states have done research and found there really is no correlation between accidents and native vegetation in fact some have found mowed fescue often attracts deer as opposed to native plants
9304706 others like the natural look we try to balance them both
9304707 the question is how can we utilize the best practices where we are preserving the natural beauty of wildflowers while also ensuring invasive species dont take hold
9304708 how can we use an alternative to herbicide spraying that will protect water quality especially in that area of the ozark national scenic riverways
9304709 pc financial urged me to use the card to get bonus points
9304710 without telling me that any payments would go first to balance transfers
9304711 any payments you make typically are applied first to the lowest rate balance
9304712 we call these customers gamers as their only objective is to continue transferring balances from higher rate cards then transfer them elsewhere when the low interest rate period expires
9304713 pc financial are the gamers as are other credit card companies that hide their tricks in the small print
9304714 i did it from the goodness of my heart so they could make some money
9304715 realized there was a sudden upsurge in the economy and therefore huge demand for manpower
9304716 talk to rahman for an hour and you get 20 different stories
9304717 then i found out he went behind my back and got another 1 500 from her
9304718 no need to take admission exams no need to study receive a college degree for what you already know
9304719 i reamed him out royally when i found out what he had done
9304720 i have a friend who owns a dealership he gives me a good deal on short term leases
9304721 the philippines is a very tough place to do business
9304722 the topic doesnt exist or they dont have access to it
9304723 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
9304724 do all canadians share equally in that great quality of life no they dont the truth is that our country is so wealthy that it manages to mask the reality of food banks in our cities of unacceptable housing of young inuit adults very high suicide rates
9304725 investing in early childhood development provides one of the best ways to reduce health inequities
9304726 a surrogate to our own bodys navigation of urban environment and ultimately a transferable act of imagination
9304727 its just a wonderful gritty environment theres a sense of discovery
9304728 they had the large population the industrial living you had three and four families living in a dwelling
9304729 the strip district was an ideal place for us to start
9304730 there really arent many chain stores around here its like local mom and pop businesses and the strips kind of become like a gourmet foodie destination
9304731 people come down to get fresh ingredients and unique stuff and just to walk around
9304732 pittsburgh is a community town and thats why everybody that lives here loves it
9304733 pittsburgh isnt the type of town that you go to that has strip malls
9304734 i wanted to grow my hair long and stop wearing suits
9304735 you can live they say you can live over here
9304736 obviously this has been a traumatic six weeks for everyone
9304737 they visited perhaps for the first time foreign countries or tropical islands
9304738 those first timers will be back if not this year then in the years to come
9304739 because of current global economic conditions and the huge increase in ships competing for your vacation dollar some of this years best deals and itineraries are available for immediate departure
9304740 youll never get the best deal by booking direct with a cruise line
9304741 i was one of the first 10 and paid half price 4 790
9304742 today a franchise is 9 500 plus you pay 3 percent of gross royalties
9304743 were all at home travel agents i tell people im their personal cruise consultant i can do everything they need through the internet
9304744 they can do all the research they want for free on the website there are all the cruise lines the schedules the prices the shore excursions
9304745 theres no cost to book on the site any questions call me if they have a problem im there to help them 24 7 its hard for somebody to ask me a question that i cant get an answer to
9304746 personally i dont hardly cruise anymore unless i have a balcony
9304747 the biggest innovations in the onboard product are coming from norwegian cruise line
9304748 recent history has been showing that what they do today other lines will copy and adapt within three or four years
9304749 each evening you will be choosing the type of cuisine and ambiance of the restaurant
9304750 and you will have too many choices on one ship to even make it to all of them on a single cruise
9304751 will other lines join this change to the traditional cruise experience maybe maybe not
9304752 the important thing to remember is that the traditional cruise experience will exist on other sizes of ships still sailing
9304753 nothing says you have to sail on the newest ship
9304754 our philosophy is that the public should be notified when we are looking at cultures of disease
9304755 its much better to be open and get messages to them about how to protect their health while we didnt have great information yet about what was causing it we always tell people were investigating
9304756 why did it take so long for that testing to occur and for them to tell people about it in general u s food safety officials say what they know and what they dont know they dont congratulate themselves for discovering dead and sick people
9304757 i think the point about time delays in reporting to the public is well taken
9304758 the complication in this investigation is were dealing with federal provincial and local jurisdictions and the question is who issues the public statement as toronto public health do we do that theres no question well do a post mortem of this and see where things could have been sped up
9304759 two cases in a nursing home is absolutely not what youd expect
9304760 we asked those questions on a conference call if youre told its not available for public consumption whats the point of informing the public if we did know that we might have gone public if theres a risk to human health absolutely wed go public as soon as the product came back with listeria
9304761 if i had cases from the public we would have warned the public but i only had cases in institutions
9304762 we said that it was institutional but also said it could be sold at retail we try to cover off as much as possible because we dont always know where the meat is ending up
9304763 if you look back to july they could have said were seeing a lot of listeria and heres the kinds of products where listeria is found ready to eat meats unpasteurized milk and cheeses and hot dogs and if youre experiencing symptoms talk to your doctor going early might actually save lives
9304764 if you start blowing the whistle on everything you lose public confidence pretty quickly besides getting your pants sued off if we went through this whole investigation into maple leaf and came up with nothing they would say so you basically made a big fuss over a few cases of some compromised people and its cost us 20 million in lost productivity
9304765 select nid title from node n where n bid d and n uid d
9304766 ive had enough kidnapping corrupt police a rotten judicial system
9304767 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9304768 the most frustrating thing has been the indolence of many of the authorities their insensitivity
9304769 i have often asked myself why why me why my daughter
9304770 when you go out you go with fear are you going to make it home or not
9304771 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks
9304772 the best just got better record approx 4 hours of tv out of the box using a 4gb usb flashdrive
9304773 they merely said she canceled and he would be there as planned there was no explanation
9304774 deeply concerned about the possibility that mr mccain could become president
9304775 most people do not understand that there was a funnel effect there that caused this storm surge that inadvertently drowned the entire city
9304776 it was not just a simple matter of a storm coming through and flooding a city the fact is that a huge 30 foot wave came up a man made canal and inundated the city with water
9304777 it was totally the product of shipping interests who wanted a shortcut from the gulf of mexico into the city of new orleans by building this they didnt have to navigate the twists and turns of the mississippi river
9304778 it was eroding year by year this is not something the residents didnt warn everybody about and holler about for 40 years trying to get people to close it
9304779 it went from 300 feet wide to 3 000 feet wide taking all the land with it and all the wetlands with it those are the natural buffers against hurricanes
9304780 what i could never figure out was why the main story post katrina was never this story all i heard was about the poor response from the bush administration
9304781 i was looking at the parking and getting a feel for what the needs are for the court water district and library
9304782 were over the contingency and i dont know where the funding will come from beyond that
9304783 maybe it will come out of savings down the road or from general revenue
9304784 the decisions to use the moneys to supplement the city hall project occurred despite the repeated forecast of a softening economy
9304785 were on schedule with the structural steel foundation and metal deck
9304786 the city is doing site improvements paving parking lots and drives
9304787 hoy se ve m s gente que hace cuatro a os
9304788 es muy frustrante es la tercera marcha en once a os 1997 2004 y 2008 y las demandas son las mismas
9304789 no queremos confrontaciones ni pleitos partidistas queremos que todo el mundo luche por un m xico mejor eso es lo que la ciudadan a pide fuera la corrupci n fuera la impunidad
9304790 quiero sentir la confianza y la seguridad al salir de casa
9304791 el tema de la seguridad ya no afecta nada m s a la gente que tiene mucho dinero sino a todos
9304792 queremos resultados que se vea la diferencia uno ya no sabe de qui n cuidarse hasta los polic as te roban
9304793 now that theyve emptied the garage im worried theyll move on to the house
9304794 we know theres people watching waiting for something to be left out
9304795 as long as there are a large number of people addicted to narcotics that live on this island well always have a problem with theft
9304796 you would expect that youd be able to put a potted plant on your porch but thats not the case
9304797 some people stealing is part of their culture and part of their life
9304798 to them its a 24 hour a day job if they want it bad enough theyre going to get it you have to remain vigilant against that
9304799 ich kann mir vorstellen dass man bei den preisen f r gespr che noch weiter heruntergeht
9304800 kids even when theyre sick are resilient theyre upbeat and hopeful and we wanted to give them that kind of environment
9304801 maar sinds de ramp van tsjernobyl zie je er steeds meer

9304803 pienso que no he aportado nada verdaderamente significativo al cine soy un humorista de brooklyn y broadway que ha tenido mucha suerte
9304804 un lbum de fotos recopiladas a lo largo de media vida que ofrecen una clara imagen de transformaci n desde sus inicios en el cine hasta llegar a convertirse en uno de los directores m s aclamados del mundo
9304805 hasta llegar a la adolescencia yo ten a a hope como ejemplo a seguir e intentaba hacer chistes y soltar ocurrencias con gracia pero cuando crec y fui m s culto quer a escribir dramas
9304806 pensaba que ser an unas ciudades bonitas y nada m s pero son incre bles espa a es un mercado muy importante para mis pel culas en europa me suele ir bastante bien en estados unidos como ya se sabe ni siquiera el hecho de contar con el apoyo de la cr tica se traduce en un xito de taquilla

9304808 he has been co operating with investigators and weve had the opportunity to sit down with him and get his version of the events
9304809 he died a hero serving the country that he loved but always remember that he lived a hero
9304810 les boks sont champions du monde et ils ont montr dans cette comp tition le tri nations quil ny avait pas une grande diff rence de niveau ils sont entr s t t dans le match et ont ensuite atteint leur vitesse de croisi re de villiers a t critiqu toute la semaine mais tout le m rite lui revient ainsi quaux joueurs
9304811 i dont understand what you mean by street art if it has no permission it is regular destruction and should be punished i think it is equal to destroying someones car
9304812 haha look at the crappy dancing we made you do for weeks on end
9304813 hey do boring dances moves and your fans will love it
9304814 are the guys in big bang great performers or big drama queens
9304815 well top could eat gd for breakfast and still be hungry
9304816 im proud of daesung for not wearing a white shirt he knows the rest of his group looks horrible
9304817 hopefully news coverage will be heavy and tell people when the roads are clear or when grocery stores are open
9304818 who knows the university of texas medical branch or mainland medical center might not be fully operational you have to gauge what there is to come back to like a worst case scenario but i certainly hope we dont see that
9304819 theres not much good in coming back in town if there is no electricity or no grocery stores to provide food after the storm makes landfall well determine how quickly to allow people back in
9304820 in the episcopal church the belief that god speaks uniquely through bishops laity priests and deacons enables our participatory structure and allows a fullness of revelation and insight that must not be lost in this important time of discernment
9304821 the joint work of the house of deputies and the house of bishops is the highest institutional expression of this belief
9304822 we remain to say that the orthodox voice is an authentic piece of the anglican episcopal tapestry
9304823 those anxious to signal their firm commitment to catholic communion anglicanism and an alliance of differentiation and identification within the episcopal church can avail themselves of this plan
9304824 i beheld our lord seated in glory with st peter st paul and st john
9304825 ecumenical participants are here precisely on that ticket they are representing their churches as sisters in communion as friends they are there because they are armenian orthodox or salvation army
9304826 the problem that we face within the anglican communion is that bishops gathering for the lambeth conference represent not only their diocese but their participation in the fellowship of worldwide anglican christians where there are bishops whose participation in that worldwide fellowship is for one reason or another questionable thats the reason for questioning their participation here
9304827 answer with a long disquisition on armenian christology but i dont think i dont think thats an option for this audience
9304828 there is a one line solution everything will be settled if the ancillary units are relocated to the land on the opposite side of the small car unit
9304829 at least 50 trained personnel from the fire brigade departments of surat and ahmedabad left today with rescue equipments
9304830 ultimately it is a question of the identity of the anglican church where does it belong
9304831 does it belong more to the churches of the first millennium catholic and orthodox or does it belong more to the protestant churches of the 16th century at the moment it is somewhere in between but it must clarify its identity now and that will not be possible without certain difficult decisions
9304832 we hope that certain fundamental questions will be clarified at the conference so that dialogue will be possible
9304833 we shall work and pray that it is possible but i think that it is not sustainable to keep pushing decision making back because it only extends the crisis
9304834 nie dopu cimy do sytuacji w kt rej polska ze wszystkich kraj w unii b dzie mia a najgorsze relacje z rosj i w tym radykalizmie pozostanie osamotniona to by by dramatyczny b d

9304843 we look forward to working togeth er over the coming months to bring sta bility security and economic develop ment as well as governance to the dis trict of maywand
9304844 our initial perception is there are some folks who are happy to see us there are other folks that are reluctant at best just because the taliban pres ence has been there for so long
9304845 theres probably going to be some fence sitters that are waiting to find out if were going to stick around or not and it will be our mission over the next cou ple of months to turn those guys over to decide to support the government of af ghanistan
9304846 were not there yet but with the addition of this very capable infantry battalion from the u s army were moving in the right direction

9304848 it is hard to imagine palin playing the same sort of role that modern vice presidents like gore bush cheney or mondale played
9304849 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay atten tion

9304855 it was one of those heat of the moment situations luckily it didnt get out of hand it wasnt that big of a deal i dont want to blow it up that much
9304856 but thats what happens when you havent gotten on a mound
9304857 a big day im not worried if he comes out feeling good i really dont have too many concerns im excited by what i saw well sit down and talk and map out the next step
9304858 we didnt do it in april or may so theyre available now

9304870 before concluding i wish to look at two possible objections to my position
9304871 i dont want to go into that needless to say it is very disappointing to see the tournament postponed and i am hoping now we can get some cricket in south africa in september
9304872 but we will hopefully have some practice games to test out the fitness of all players
9304873 their hard work and efforts are very good and they are bowling again but they need more practice games so that we can confirm their fitness 100 per cent
9304874 i was thrown out of my home some 30 years back when i suffered from tb my husband left me on road and i know how i managed to survive and get myself treated by visiting different hospitals in the capital
9304875 my husband refused to accept the child and asked me to take her to my parents home
9304876 there was nobody to help me i wanted to get rid of this man many years back but i remained quiet because that would have spoilt my daughters life but now she is married and well settled so i want a divorce from him
9304877 i know i wont be able to live long but i want to take revenge on my husband who has ruined my life

9304883 a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day and one of those is at night so its only really getting a snapshot of activity zephyr would be watching all day
9304884 in contradiction to a 60 year assumption in archaeology weve managed to show that neanderthal stone tool technologies are no less efficient in a number of respects thanhomo sapiensstone tool technologies this suggests that neanderthals did not go extinct because of inferior intellect or technology
9304885 although it is relatively rare to find the eggs and babies of extinct animals it is even rarer to find them inside the body of the mother

9304889 put the money toward what you know will result in the greatest kingdom impact we want you to guarantee that people far from god will be found and that the found will grow in their love for god and other people
9304890 you see a much better alignment of production with market demands
9304891 youll see a lot of brands we traditionally have high depreciation rates for
9304892 quality has actually gotten a lot better but their perceived quality is still low
9304893 weve always stressed that people need to bring their own bedding
9304894 in a situation like a hurricane theres not time to bring hundreds of thousands of cots into one location
9304895 i am not sure whether i did better in the first fight i would have to watch the tape first
9304896 but i do know that i was quicker this time it is great to have the title back and i am very happy about it
9304897 all the changes in training have paid off and i am vern easy fight because we knew what tactics ruiz would employ but i think i did well to keep him at bay it was not perfect though there is still room for improvement
9304898 but thanks to alexander i have become much quicker as you could see tonight and that was the key for success
9304899 that was a great performance by nikolai he jabbed very well in the first eight rounds before getting a little tired he deserved to win tonight
9304900 it is ridiculous when the scorecard is going all over the place after the fight is boxing turning to the negative side i hope the wba will step up and somehow this can be fixed
9304901 i am very disappointed about the outcome but i want to thank the german fans and the german people for their support
9304902 i hope to come back one day for pleasure not for business
9304903 we just had to give him a bit of time off after newbury as he wasnt quite right
9304904 hes been working well i thought he might be better for the race and he still might be
9304905 aside from the dubai race world cup and the breeders cup this is the most important race weve won because of the historic nature of this race and its premier contribution to curlins legacy
9304906 with all the superstition and the graveyard of champions i was glad the horse showed what he is and we won
9304907 the perfect scenario would be to run in the best races the jockey club gold cup and the breeders cup and then go overseas to the japan cup but that will be hard to press into a four week schedule
9304908 well wait and see he loves belmont and now i think he loves saratoga
9304909 the players are very aware of the fact that we need to get some points on the board chelsea coming at this time is a great fixture for us to lift the spirits
9304910 you know you are playing against one of the top sides in the league and that spurs you on
9304911 if you go there and try to put everyone behind the ball and defend that it is likely to end in defeat
9304912 the important thing is to go there and play attacking ambitious football
9304913 if you go there and show character and attack that is the way forward
9304914 you should treat everyone the same but sometimes you put in the better performances against the better clubs the whole team does as well as me
9304915 chelsea will definitely be a bit wary of us because weve tended to do well against them recently especially in the carling cup final last season
9304916 it was one of the most important goals of my career
9304917 i wasnt really scoring goals at the time and there was a lot said about it so the importance of the goal meant a lot to the fans club and me as well
9304918 weve not been good enough with the players weve had weve been more than capable of winning our first two games
9304919 everyone has a bad run through the season and hopefully this is it and getting a result against chelsea can kick start our season
9304920 ive looked at the fixtures and weve got a run of games we can get results in
9304921 its about belief you go out with the right mentality to get the result weve got players to put on a real show but weve got to earn the right to do so
9304922 we might need to be more harder to beat it will come right its not too early to get disheartened
9304923 hes going to be operated on as its a clean break of his femur i understand a clean break is better than a partial break
9304924 it is a shame but thats the nature of the sport it is dangerous and unfortunately its our name thats come out of the hat this time
9304925 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9304926 its been my decision the club has never given their opinion theyve always left it to me to make the decision
9304927 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head
9304928 we realised this during the spanish supercopa we wanted to win the title so we decided it was better to use players who at that time were more focused until the matter is resolved definitely he will not be in perfect condition to play
9304929 he could score our 5 000th goal at the bernabeu if we win 1 0 on sunday it could happen i know whats best for him just like a father knows whats best for his son he will eventually realise we are right
9304930 no i repeat that the decision was mine i want him to sort out his situation well see what we do when he returns from playing with brazil
9304931 and many of our citizens across the country may think that in fact there are no drugs in prison
9304932 a drug dog can usually only work for about four hours a day so your dog burns out youve been using him inside searching cells and the institution and now you have visits start and your dogs spent for the day
9304933 i am starting to play better nadal told reporters after clinching his 41st win in his past 42 matches
9304934 today i played better than the last days i started playing well and today i served very well
9304935 were prairie people and were strong and we pull together when things happen
9304936 we will get through this as we got through the flood
9304937 so much of the damage was trees breaking off and falling down and theres no insurance that im aware of to cover that
9304938 some people hired crews to come in and do the cleanup some were attempting to do it themselves and some of them were renting equipment
9304939 im not aware of anyone who knew it was coming we expected some wind but not to that degree
9304940 youre never prepared for the degree of destruction that we had this time ive been in this country for a long time and ive never seen anything like this
9304941 i couldnt even bring myself to go an see it
9304942 everybody is quite upset that church has been there for 100 years it is going to be missed
9304943 everyday when he george was able to drive he would go north up to the church and back again
9304944 the legacy and the heritage that is gone is the hard part beulah said
9304945 i like a battle tonight was a good match but every time ali got in i expected him to clear up
9304946 whereas with dave he wont try to split the pack and win frames he goes about it differently
9304947 i suppose it was all right to watch for the fans a few centuries a few winning breaks but being professional as we are youre obviously wondering why there were so many big breaks and how they came about
9304948 a lot of them were elementary mistakes which is unforgivable at this level
9304949 i played so well to go 5 1 up i was dictating the match then i missed a black at 30 0 and the whole match swung
9304950 he started having the run of the balls which i had been getting earlier i was so glad to get over the line i was desperate in the end
9304951 when he got me angled on the last red at 68 33 in the last frame i thought the gods were against me but i managed to hit the red which was a tough shot
9304952 i didnt feel any nerves early on but theres no doubt i did towards the end i think i was entitled to do so after 14 years
9304953 i held myself together and that black at 5 1 was the only easy ball i missed
9304954 its disappointing to lose at the semi final stage it would have been great to the start the season with a final
9304955 i missed a couple in the first four frames and played a few bad positional shots but dave played brilliantly to go 5 1 up
9304956 we almost found a way to lose i thought we squandered ample opportunities in the first half we had genuine try scoring plays
9304957 i had a real bad feeling at the start of the second half i thought it was going to come back to bite us
9304958 we are a very good front running team but i knew the first try would provide momentum for hull
9304959 credit to us we were honest for 80 minutes and i think that got us through
9304960 we know we can compete on the big day against the good teams
9304961 it was there for all to see that we have makeshift players at half back this is our third final in four years and theres no reason we cant come back
9304962 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9304963 its been my decision the club has never given their opinion theyve always left it to me to make the decision
9304964 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head
9304965 we realised this during the spanish supercopa we wanted to win the title so we decided it was better to use players who at that time were more focused
9304966 i am feeling fine i am feeling really good and my recovery is going well
9304967 i am more than happy with my progress and i hope to be back playing for united by the end of september that is my target and it is a realistic one
9304968 he was playing unbelievably hitting serves bang on the line hitting his forehands huge and coming in behind it and i didnt really get any rhythm
9304969 i managed to fight and once i broke him in the third set the first time id broken him in the match i started to feel a little bit better and i think that was the key
9304970 i just started to return better as the match went on
9304971 it was tough especially at the start of melzers cramps murray continued
9304972 he obviously wasnt really trying hard there at the end of the fourth set
9304973 youre not sweating as much you cool down a little bit and then to really get yourself fired up for the fifth is tricky especially when he comes out and is running everything down again
9304974 i think towards the end of the fifth he was struggling pretty badly
9304975 this is why you put in all that hard work for moments like these
9304976 weve put a 7million bid on the table to manchester united
9304977 the complexities of their situation are that it depends on them getting one in that one might well be bulgarian berbatov
9304978 as i said all the way through the summer we need to be respectful of that and theres nothing i can do to force the situation
9304979 if they do bring someone in i want to be at the front of the queue and i will do whatever it takes to bring campbell to the football club
9304980 there will be a lot of people alluding to the fact weve got carried away with ourselves but i can absolutely guarantee that im here for the long term building the football club
9304981 a lot of times people get into trouble because theyre simply not aware that severe weather is creeping up on them quickly
9304982 thats why in the summertime with thunderstorms its kind of an individual responsibility to try to make themselves aware of severe weather occurrences
9304983 i am very happy with the technology and after researching we checker saw it as the wave of the future
9304984 i am especially conscious of it emitting when i am idling at the casino for 20 minutes i dont have to worry about it with the hybrid

9304992 can you imagine if the administration would choose to avoid any form of national attention and let them take advantage of some of the negative corruption trials
9304993 but we must also take responsibility the changing image of alaska
9304994 it was senator mccain who refused to provide support for soldiers in iraq regardless of political cost
9304995 i see more charities operating in the community but i also see a very generous community
9304996 prince albert is unique in the way it approaches the communitys needs
9304997 i think this city has a long history of its citizens getting behind projects

9305000 churches in canada tend to be the biggest beneficiaries of charitable giving
9305001 it costs money to raise money but the majority of funds by law at least 80 per cent should go to the charity
9305002 were kind of in a bubble here the bloom is not likely to fall off that rose
9305003 theres always projects that come forward and people will continue to support them
9305004 my mother having died in palliative care i see the need for that
9305005 they need to look at all the organizations that require assistance and make decisions based on where they feel their money will benefit

9305019 they have been booked for drinking without a licence under prostitution related laws and for watching illegal shows of blue films and a dance show by bar girls banned by the government in 2005
9305020 many of the officials were in various stages of undress most of them work in and around mumbai some are connected with the mumbai international airport at sahar
9305021 around 6pm on tuesday several vehicles and a mini bus carrying the officials and dancers arrived at the two storey bungalow the party started soon after our team waited outside
9305022 one raju bibbas bharundev choudhary made the arrangements for the customs officials we are trying to ascertain who engaged him the officials or any of their beneficiaries we are probing whether this party was a payment in lieu of any illegal aid extended by the customs officials to someone
9305023 we are not out of the woods yet we are still in cone of error and monitoring conditions all employees available in town are here and those out of town will be called a moments notice to respond
9305024 mi abuelita my grandmother could neither read nor write but because of them today i hold a doctorate in education
9305025 shortly therafter i got a call and i was asked if i would be willing to do this
9305026 i think it was you know kind of the pinch me moment
9305027 oh my god time travel is fucked up and it hurts my brain
9305028 he walked in threw the device over the top of an aisle and hit a 19 year old female in the head then it landed on the ground and did not shatter

9305030 everybody is pulling together and really going out there and targeting impaired drivers
9305031 we are not out of the woods yet were still in the cone of error and monitoring conditions all employees available in town are here and those out of town will be called at a moments notice to respond
9305032 we determined the two suspects had warrants out of houston
9305033 i do believe these people were on a crime spree from houston to corpus christi and we ended that crime spree here in corpus
9305034 when he became involved in that accident and struck the barricade officers still tried to save his life
9305035 our blocking took emporia out of their game and they had to make some changes that led to our victory i was also pleased in the way that we finished each set off
9305036 i thought our match against emporia state was a great team effort from all 16 players
9305037 we beat ourselves we came out slow and we were not ready to play
9305038 i thought the two long drives and goalline stand were big
9305039 steve managed the game very well and our defense came up with the some key stops
9305040 we didnt panic when we were down at halftime we prepped really well and executed the game plan
9305041 you may be asking yourself what an old punk rocker like me is doing going to a disco show
9305042 the way a team plays as a whole determines its success you may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world but if they dont play together the club wont be worth a dime
9305043 if there are other parents who have taken their kids to the hospital we would like to know and possibly where they got
9305044 could the blood be what killed all of this grass
9305045 the blood on the grass seems to be in roughly the same areas where all of the grass died but still its not a perfect match
9305046 well i mean it wouldnt have done much good had you not then saved us right
9305047 youre such an amazing person julian yet you give yourself so little credit im really glad that you came here to help me through my fathers death i was already in your debt but now after saving my sisters life and i know she can be such a pain i cant even imagine how to repay you for all of this
9305048 i never knew that blood could kill grass like this and so quickly at that
9305049 look i know that it seems rash but i think that you should leave here and come to aidelede with me
9305050 i will have to do a better job of protecting her i suppose
9305051 julian you are absolutely welcomed to stay here if you like but i cant leave this is my familys farm i now have to tend to my fathers grave and try to do my best to ensure the farm is maintained the way he would have wanted
9305052 you previously explained that your mother is gone you have no other family and now your father has passed into eternity as well
9305053 a lot has happened over the past few days and i momentarily lost my composition
9305054 well perhaps ill stay for a few days and we can talk about what to do next
9305055 i have to go put daddy back in his hole
9305056 i i think that i should go up there first and see what things look like
9305057 if you need help just call out ill kill a hundred damned wolves if i have to
9305058 you said that you would do anything to repay me for saving your sister
9305059 we are going to go back to your house pack up your things and go to aidelede
9305060 i think that its pretty obvious that my father is upset about my leaving without telling him where i was going so its unlikely that hell let us all stay with him and mother
9305061 my father and i our relationship is complicated i know that he does it out of love but still that possessiveness always pushed us apart from one another and thus i feel as if ive grown up without every really discovering who he was
9305062 but then again i could have told my parents where i was going i know that my father cares about me hence what i did was wrong my father and i you see we seem to have arrived at this mutual understanding that were never going to understand each other and we were both fine with that until apparently and im only guessing what my father now feels up until i left for your farm although this was not always the case in my own adulthood i have developed a great deal of respect for my father he is a reputable person and has been performing civil service for some twenty to thirty years in this small little town but i am my own person now and he wanted me to be his and stay with him here in aidelede forever did i choose to live a life in this small little town with nobody else to talk to but my parents
9305063 after contemplating how to deal with this situation for what oh it has to have been about a decade or so now ive decided that i will eventually leave this place so that i dont end up becoming an extension of my father always wondering if the things that i accomplish were caused by my own ambition or instead as a result of a combination of the significant goodwill that he has built up in the community added to his constant scrutiny of my personal affairs
9305064 to be honest with you i was thinking about this on the way back from the farm i have no source of income now and i dont want to stay in this area on account of everything that just happened so i was planning on traveling down to hindoltyne in order to join the imperial army back when my dad was still in good health i had considered doing this so that i could help him with his expenses and travel throughout the provinces but then well you know how that turned out but anyway now it seems like joining the army might be the only way i will be able to make a living without the farm
9305065 and what get yourself butchered by those monsters attacking the northern provinces in order to defend the memory of an empire now on the very brink of collapse
9305066 you know that i wouldnt be fighting for those reasons
9305067 i assume that if i stay that youre still going to leave
9305068 its fine ill say goodbye to my parents this evening and well leave in the morning
9305069 and while you do ill go make arrangements with some family friends in order to ensure sayna has a place to stay while were gone
9305070 as long as it takes for me to find out whatever it is that i am supposed discover in life i suppose despite the abstractness of that goal
9305071 i know youll do fine but you should say goodbye to your father before you leave
9305072 father i am very sorry that i left like that without telling you but my friend you know the one i once told you about the farmer baluf well he didnt show up to sell his wares in town this week so i grew concerned and went to his house
9305073 and you didnt have one spare second throughout all of that time to stop here and tell us where you were going even though you know that we require you to inform us of your intended whereabouts when you spend the night away from this house
9305074 i was very worried and forgot it was an honest mistake
9305075 please repeat that i must not have heard you correctly the first time because i know that no child of mine would speak to his father with such insolence
9305076 im leaving tomorrow for hindoltyne to join the imperial military with my friend
9305077 then fine leave but if you go you are not welcomed to come back
9305078 here i will always be a shadow of someone else here i will never discover who i really am and thus live out a life that i will look back upon with regret
9305079 its not like that at all mother and you know it
9305080 to try to force me to stay by making me feel guilty about leaving isnt fair i dont know if the life that i am going to have away from here will be better or worse than the one that i have now but i feel i have a right to find out for myself
9305081 youve really grown up so fast julian much too fast go go with your friend and become who you will become may you stay safe and never forget how much your father and i love you
9305082 ah well why am i to care that he is gone
9305083 the children of farmers are usually so dreadfully uneducated and thus rather uninteresting to talk to anyway
9305084 i i guess i just saw you and was wondering who you were there arent a lot of younger people around here theyve all gone off to the sea the new capital city or to the imperial army in search of a better life its lonely for the young people that are left you know
9305085 i live on the outskirts of aidelede with my family on a farm i know all about the isolation of which you speak
9305086 my boy you have no skill at riding and even if you had nightfall is almost upon us you should probably be getting home there are lots of things out in the countryside that could send you to an early grave
9305087 sir i would like a horse and i will pay you for it at twice the price you usually ask
9305088 hopefully he will get frustrated with her and come back to town safely but knowing that horse quite slowly
9305089 it would be safer to camp near the edge of the forest away from the road
9305090 julian i can give you what you want just remember me
9305091 a less erudite person would have been terrified about such a dream for days
9305092 is this where baluf lives upon hearing his name the little girls expression changed instantly from one of vexation to glee
9305093 baluf is out there in the fields behind the hills

9305256 all this criticism of raikkonen reminds me of when filippo inzaghi was at juventus if he didnt score for three games everyone would say he was in crisis
9305257 it cant be forgotten that hes the world champion and that last year he won in his first season with ferrari while many people never thought he would do so now he has 17 victories and i hope hell get back to winning ways in the next grand prix in belgium anyway hes not a driver in crisis

9305276 before the contest i had a vision of a musical contest like the ones i used to watch when i was a child nowadays theres no musical value to the songs and winners of the contest the winners are the ones with masks or brilliant choreographies when i realized i have made a mistake it was too late to back down i went to eurovision for patriotic reasons i wanted to represent my country my mistake was that i treated the mission like the olympic games my wife and manager tried to talk me out of taking part i should have listened to her
9305277 that would have made my day plus nobody ever mentions the country which tied with israel for 11th estonia who wouldnt have wanted to see 5 housewives singing in a language which about 15 other people could understand accompanied by a guy who can play the drums with his head now that is eurovision
9305278 and personally i think belarus and switzerland should have qualified just for a laugh in 04
9305279 oh and anyone who enters eurovision believing it is merely a musical contest is seriously deluded
9305280 one of the most common clauses is the no cooking no cleaning one in fact one girl told me to clarify to my brother that he would have to do the cooking every day after work since she hates spending time in the kitchen says a very amused kulkarni
9305281 because you wont find these values unless the girl has been brought up in india well the girl brought up in india is evidently beginning to put her pretty foot down
9305282 the disparity in salary from which stemmed the vast difference in lifestyle no longer exists she says
9305283 today with salaries in post liberalisation urban india particularly in certain sectors almost on par with those abroad we have access to everything that indians abroad were envied for designer clothes gourmet food fancy cars and exotic holidays
9305284 when i can get the same lifestyle here in mumbai and also get to keep my job and friends why would i want to uproot myself and start afresh in a completely new setting
9305285 in our time it was impossible to live separately and i was looking for a bit of freedom says nandini mitra 45 year old canadabased housewife
9305286 the situation is different now at least in the metros many couples work in a different city from their parents in fact even in the same city more and more couples are beginning to set up separate homes
9305287 this isnt the case in the last decade now most women want to kickstart their careers before they tie the knot
9305288 after having climbed the corporate ladder in mastek a technology company in india coming to san francisco with my husband was a difficult choice she says
9305289 however i got lucky when my company offered me a position in california this way i could keep my job as well as get married to the groom in the us
9305290 at each zap of our remote control the consciousness of our unhappiness may increase exponentially
9305291 thus the main goal of teaching is not that of having students memorize data it is that of modifying and enriching students knowledge structure
9305292 students just followed the way route that the teacher provided and they did not think there were other ways
9305293 take another look at who they allow to perform during both ticketed and free concerts in city limits
9305294 we would prefer that they were not brought back under the towns sponsorship
9305295 come to think of it church is free maybe we should put censorship stickers on bibles because in the pages seems to be a lot of rhetoric about war violence rape incest and sex so i hope they dont let their children hear that stuff

9305299 we are opening shelters now we have a few thousand people that are being evacuated and several are moving into shelters today throughout the whole state of texas
9305300 youre right there with the people you get to see them meet them and get to see some real fortitude of the folks
9305301 its just an amazing feeling just to see their smiles on their faces and they just say thank you
9305302 were referring him for the count of robbery in the first degree and first degree rape
9305303 we came out great the first two games and played very well
9305304 then game three we came out tentative and without the same life and fire we had good blocking in games one and two but we werent as focused the last three to their credit they did a great job too and also slowed the pace down they capitalized on our timidity and applied pressure to us college volleyball is about who applies the pressure they also started to dig everything under the sun although part of it was us continually hitting it to the same place

9305309 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9305310 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9305311 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9305312 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9305313 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9305314 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9305315 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9305316 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9305317 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9305318 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9305319 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9305320 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9305321 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9305322 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9305323 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9305324 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9305325 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9305326 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9305327 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9305328 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9305329 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9305330 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9305331 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9305332 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9305333 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9305334 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9305335 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9305336 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9305337 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9305338 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9305339 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9305340 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9305341 no one works for someone we all just work together
9305342 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9305343 listen man im 6 foot 3 weighing in at 90 kilos
9305344 and my mate tommy here is even 6 foot 6 with more than 100 kilos
9305345 that bloke over there named stevie is a former youth boxing champion see youre outnumbered 3 against 1 so do you still want to tell you joke
9305346 the paint can said for best results use two coats
9305347 we nearly didnt sign that wayne he has some outrageous demands
9305348 i dont have any idea who it was it was some stupid woman wanting to know if the coast is clear
9305349 i finished this puzzle in 53 days and it says 3 6 years
9305350 well thats the weird thing in every single dream the same thing happened i always come to this door but i cant open it i keep pushing the door and pushing the door but it wouldnt budge
9305351 the first lesson is you dont necessarily do everything the fans want you to do
9305352 i am a fan too and i would love to have a squad that is much better than everyone elses
9305353 we are very nearly there but not quite i think we are quite happy we are not going to buy somebody who doesnt improve the squad
9305354 we didnt play well at fulham on saturday but i think all this stuff about us having to buy a complete lot of new players is rubbish
9305355 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9305356 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9305357 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9305358 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9305359 were very very young on the mens side theyre going to be real good down the road well have to take our lumps but were going to improve and get back at it next week
9305360 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9305361 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9305362 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9305363 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9305364 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9305365 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9305366 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9305367 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9305368 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9305369 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9305370 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9305371 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9305372 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9305373 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9305374 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9305375 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9305376 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9305377 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9305378 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9305379 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9305380 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9305381 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9305382 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9305383 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9305384 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9305385 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9305386 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9305387 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9305388 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9305389 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9305390 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9305391 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9305392 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9305393 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9305394 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9305395 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9305396 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9305397 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9305398 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9305399 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9305400 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9305401 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9305402 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9305403 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9305404 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9305405 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9305406 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9305407 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9305408 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9305409 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9305410 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9305411 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9305412 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9305413 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9305414 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9305415 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9305416 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9305417 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9305418 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9305419 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9305420 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9305421 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9305422 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9305423 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9305424 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9305425 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls
9305426 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9305427 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9305428 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9305429 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9305430 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9305431 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9305432 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9305433 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9305434 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9305435 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9305436 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9305437 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9305438 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

9305470 we played very well today as we were able to do our damage at the net
9305471 we had nine blocks including five alone in game two and the key was holding them to a 028 attack mark including negative numbers in the final two games

9305475 hunter is such a tremendous athlete he spent much of the preseason a little confused but in the last couple days of practice he has really exploded
9305476 i was really really pleased with the win because one of our most composed defenders junior calvin clark had to sit out this match after getting a red card with six minutes left in our last game last year
9305477 we had to make some adjustments in his absence so to get a shutout without one of our best defenders and with a goalie michael drozd making his college start debut was really satisfying
9305478 drozd is very athletic and very competitive and in the two years he had to wait around for his chance to start he didnt feel sorry for himself
9305479 whatever subs we brought on kept adding had positive impact
9305480 we are in talks with the indian film company and should be able to finalise the deal in a weeks time
9305481 there is a lack of talent and with just a handful of films that feature the top actors that draw audiences to the cinema halls the cost of production is increasing as a result the cost of acquisition of these movies is accelerating
9305482 ultimately studios realise that having an impressive slate of films is essential for the business going forward

9305485 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august
9305486 this has resulted in one of the best snow seasons in recent years in the snowy mountains but has also kept sydneysiders shivering
9305487 it is not that unusual to see the combination of low temperatures and low rainfall colder air cannot hold as much moisture as warmer air so we would expect drier weather to accompany the chilly conditions we have experienced this month
9305488 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too that was the biggest win for me
9305489 trying different kinds of shots too trying to add some variety
9305490 but ive had over a week to think about it so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9305491 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9305492 we are glad that the government now recognizes the fact that there is indeed a necessity to put more funds to the public education sector however we challenge them to prioritize the compensation of teachers and education workers
9305493 the allocations as proposed by malacanang are all necessities of public education system we want to believe that this is an initial move to attain the government thrust of delivering quality education for the people but we want to reiterate that all education reform measures would be futile if we fail to address the pressing concerns of the frontliners the public school teachers
9305494 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especially at the ramadan time
9305495 we regret to inform that another chemical tanker mt bunga melati 5 has been hijacked by unknown pirates on august 29 the incident occurred in international waters off the coast of yemen

9305512 we have not yet finalised our assessment however an estimated 10 000 to 11 000 people have been displaced
9305513 some of them have sheltered with their relatives and others have made temporary huts after we finalize our assessment we will appeal for aid from the federal government or other non governmental organizations
9305514 we temporarily need two million birr worth of relief aid
9305515 but when we release our official appeal on friday august 29 the amount will increase
9305516 we have already distributed blended food to 2 000 people in itang and 4 000 in lare
9305517 they need food household utensils and drugs for themselves and their livestock to bring a motorboat to akobo only costs 300 000 birr us 31 250 including transportation
9305518 herky herky how many times have i told you not to use the n word
9305519 i know i know but we can t get rid of the nigger if we don t change our tactics our style understand easy does it we don t want to give obama anything he can use so for the purposes of this meeting he obama will be referred to from now on as the illinois darky okay
9305520 now we re all agreed that we can t assassinate his war record because he doesn t have one
9305521 we ll smear him because he never served his country mccain did and he has god on his side and us
9305522 what if he says you don t have to serve in the military in a democracy or something like that that it s a free country or something like that
9305523 it won t matter we can still paint him as a disloyal arab lovin liberal with an a rab name obama free country freedom isn t free he owes his freedom to me and this is not a democracy it s a republic
9305524 okay but what are we gonna do about that bitch sarah palin mccain picked as his vp
9305525 herky how many times have i told you not to refer to that bitch as a bitch if we describe her that way and it gets out it could cost us votes she s not a bitch if she s right wing from now on we ll just call her the token hillary
9305526 okay moving along obama didn t serve in the military like mccain and that negates his right to be president he s too yellow to serve
9305527 too black to serve i saw him chairman hide under the mess hall once at da nang during a rocket attack his butt was up in the air then later he filled out the paperwork himself and gave himself a bronze star
9305528 herky are you in this meeting will you pay attention
9305529 now we re also decided to go after obama because he s a friend to al qaeda he s a communistic liberal who will give away things to minorities and women it s hard to be a white man in this country ever since jack johnson beat jim jeffries in a boxing match we ve been going down hill the liberals and their dope smoking sodomizing lesbian faggot pals are going to sell this country out agreed
9305530 okay let s get out there on those talk shows and get those emails and literature cranking out there let s send obama back to the slums back to his own kind
9305531 when the common factor turning into economic factor on goods and services holds the new weight in cost the price of each commodity tends to increase and harms in the stability of price level lead to inflation or inflationary pressure in such circumstances fixing oil prices at any rate in an agreed stagnation for a periodical duration of time can be a positive check or a principle for growth of oil economy to the u s economy as well as global economy which gets a chance to go back to the normal position as a remedial process to the economy as a whole then the chain economy instantly in terms of opportunity cost can be worked in progress by multiplying cells as a relief in the national economy
9305532 most elaborately the common factor denoting goods and services oil price level should not be increased for the period of a specific time e g 10 years resultantly the inflationary pressure will come down and the rescue operation will be taken place then the opportunities entering or creating into the several microeconomics based activities will be run and gradually expanded if other factors are remaining same or favorable
9305533 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9305534 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9305535 have you ever been in love where you could touch the moonlight when your heart is shooting stars youre holding heaven in your arms have you ever been in love
9305536 i check this cell phone every 15 minutes so ill call you right back
9305537 your outgoing message is just another example of your screwed up behavior
9305538 if i had fallen for your im lonely and miserable and regret your departure routine how did you intend to explain that you are spending nights elsewhere
9305539 see no one is there for you no one is ever going to be there for you
9305540 i feel like god hates me and i dont want to live this miserable life any more
9305541 diana now that we have prayed together will you support the prayer line by sending in a donation what is your full name and address
9305542 most of all i ran to stand up for all those who have been invisible to their government for eight long years those are the reasons i ran for president and those are the reasons i support barack obama for president
9305543 i want you to ask yourselves were you in this campaign just for me or were you in it for that young marine and others like him were you in it for that mom struggling with cancer while raising her kids were you in it for that young boy and his mom surviving on the minimum wage were you in it for all the people in this country who feel invisible
9305544 but remember before we can keep going we have to get going by electing barack obama the next president of the united states we dont have a moment to lose or a vote to spare nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
9305545 nothing less than the fate of our nation and the future of our children hang in the balance
9305546 the defendant wants to hide the truth because hes generally guilty the defense attorneys job is to make sure the jury does not arrive at that truth
9305547 theyll treat you right up there i cant thank you enough for coming down here to handle the over run mess with von braun and his bean counter troops you not only saved our bacon but you did it so all of us came out smelling like a rose with corporate headquarters what a job
9305548 suppose youve already heard the scuttle butt about the big shake up in program planning and control pp amp c
9305549 i never put a whole lot a faith in rumors
9305550 guess id better practice up on my flip chart skills
9305551 yes at huntsville alabama and new orleans on the saturn program i was an editor with a pp amp c audio visual unit back then before the handtruck from facilities arrives to move you out i need a favor
9305552 my boss at the cape put me in for a pretty hefty raise know anything about it
9305553 not quite but i sure gave it on heckuva try
9305554 i don t give a damn if you passed out cigars at
9305555 no problem sir all you have to do is send in a supplemental request the people that approved your annual budget are the same ones that approved my raise let me file the paperwork for you and get it out of the way and while we re on this subject let me be your administrative assistant that s where i can be of real help to you i ve had a good deal of experience in administration during the saturn program i left pp amp c to become the administrative assistant to the facilities manager check my file
9305556 hm i ll give it some thought my secretary said i was way behind on paperwork said you were by far the most qualified to take over give you my answer tomorrow morning
9305557 you did it finally your salary will match your talent i thought this day would never come
9305558 wait a minute wait just a darned minute your raise has nothing to do with that flip chart nut you work for this was due you from the first day you set foot at the cape roger promised it to you if we moved down there so you could put that big over run mess to bed and you didjust that can t your boss get that thru his thick head
9305559 at least in california we did enjoy living there that s what you said
9305560 yes and look what happened at vandenberg airforce base the post commander sent you his personal memo which said that you had written the best engineering report for the minuteman program and what did your supervisor do he gave your merit raise to the other guy who worked with you because he d been there a lot longer than you
9305561 my boss said there was only enough money for one raise he had to make a choice
9305562 some choice if you ask me what are you gonna do if mr flip chart says he won t pay your big raise
9305563 i ll ask for a transfer don t see how he can refuse that because it won t come out of his budget
9305564 yes i know who you are and yes you got the shaft now before you explode let me tell you that your ex boss spent a hour with me last night making sure that he followed strick company policy in handling your termination
9305565 downstairs in the engineering theater before i ever signed on to the saturn program the company rep made all of us who attended a promise he said that because we agreed to work out in the field we d be protected in case of termination lay off or whatever it s time to collect on that promise
9305566 all those file are waiting for preferential treatment know what they ll get the same as you re going to get a quick look see for job openings of course there aren t any so we type up what you already have the pink slip that big raise you just got presents another mighty big ditch to jump who s got enough budget left to handle the fourth biggest raise in corporate history
9305567 john john what in heck are you doing up here thought sure they d never get you to leave those launch control consoles out on launch pad 39 what brings you up here in this doom and gloom country anyway
9305568 i never forgot what a great job you and that sidekick of yours did with all the launch documentation all that data is going to be saved and stored up here for future launches only now to save space they want to use micro fish there s at least two years work ahead to do the conversion and i can t think of a better person to handle it than you and yes i do have enough budget to take care of that raise which by the way you sure earned never forget the surprise inspection visit von braun tried to pull on us just before launch thanks for the tipping us off had that egotistical german on his best behavior despite his remarks
9305569 just came from your personnel rep technically greg s still your boss he didn t transfer you for two weeks he put you on loan so if somehow you found another job with enough budget he was going to set on it until you went out the gate
9305570 he s covered that base too any job openings that come up preference has to be given to those still on the payroll company policy i m so very very sorry i did my best
9305571 one more thing but it makes no sense no sense at all said something about him waiting twenty years to become a full bird colonel but all he ever was or made was lieutenant colonel and why should you do better then him at his expense

9305576 everything was relatively calm during the close season compared to the publicity at other clubs and now we just want to focus on winning games
9305577 there is a dialogue between the two owners on a regular basis and they have been supportive throughout the last six months especially in the transfer market
9305578 people forget that we have bought robbie keane and paid a huge fee for javier mascherano so the commitment has still been there they have been supportive through this transfer window and at the moment it is stable
9305579 im still here but its not about me the story should always be the players
9305580 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i saw which is what i was upset about
9305581 i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing but you cant do that
9305582 if it had been the other way round i wonder what the reaction would be
9305583 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card
9305584 i will tell arsene wenger the same thing when i see him
9305585 it wasnt a reckless tackle it was a good tackle
9305586 we want to see the good players play but we want to see good tackles as well
9305587 joey has done nothing wrong im concerned about my team not individual players
9305588 we came up against a side who had to bounce back from a poor result
9305589 we needed a break which we did not get like when nicky butts header hit the bar but there is no denying they are an excellent side and will finish in the top four the only thing they are fighting for is where they will finish
9305590 i hope to do more business we need three players in
9305591 i have seven very good players and a few who could be in the future but we need a couple more
9305592 that was michaels first game back to start but i never liked people telling me who i should pick for england
9305593 i am definitely happy for him to go if he gets called up
9305594 i am very pleased with the performance both offensively and defensively it was a complete one there was great balance in the team with movement
9305595 apart from at the start of the second half we were always in control and played the game we love and showed the way we can play
9305596 we showed that against twente and did it again tonight
9305597 the fulham match had come at the start of the season after difficult games including one away in the champions league and maybe we were not ready mentally
9305598 we do not know yet he has to have an x ray on his ankle hopefully nothing is broken
9305599 he is the link between the midfield and the strikers which is very important in the game we want to play
9305600 robin showed that when he is good shape physically he is a very important player for us
9305601 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9305602 i was not surprised by the reaction of the fans i have been involved in the game long enough not to be surprised by anything
9305603 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between them but he was booked and rightly so
9305604 i want him to stay ive always said so and i stand by what i say he is important for us
9305605 its been my decision the club has never given their opinion theyve always left it to me to make the decision
9305606 you need to know in what condition a player will arrive and theres been a lot of pressure on him and he isnt in the optimum condition to play hes got too many concerns going on in his head
9305607 we realised this during the spanish supercopa we wanted to win the title so we decided it was better to use players who at that time were more focused
9305608 my impressions of the club are excellent i walked around london yesterday and im going to the stadium tomorrow
9305609 people already recognize me on the streets and ask for autographs
9305610 i was worried about my child i talked it over with my wife its important that those close to me feel comfortable about it and then i took the decision its very important to try and prove yourself in europe especially in such a serious league as the english one
9305611 i dont want to go into that needless to say it is very disappointing to see the tournament postponed and i am hoping now we can get some cricket in south africa in september
9305612 but we will hopefully have some practice games to test out the fitness of all players
9305613 the main things you want to have are martini glasses you can also put margaritas in there
9305614 the next is have a highball those are the tall skinny ones good for mixed drinks or soda then you want to make sure you have the double old fashioned also called rocks glasses those are for when you want to have a scotch on the rocks
9305615 you want to make sure you have vodka its universal
9305616 vodka goes with every type of juice so definitely have that on hand the next thing you want to have on hand is gin perfect for martinis gin and tonics then make sure you have tequila in there margaritas are the number one drink to have at home for parties so stock up on the tequila and you dont want to forget to have rum perfect for summer drinks and fun for mixed drinks
9305617 the three you must have are the jigger which measures a double shot or single shot
9305618 the next thing is the cocktail shaker and then the third thing is a corkscrew opener
9305619 youre not kidding when you say use the whole role i would have taken just a couple of pieces
9305620 you need as much absorption as you can get so you want a good half inch of paper towels and keep working on it
9305621 well if you want to put it in your family room youll probably want to use a berber thats olaphin or polypropylene
9305622 its a solution dyed product it will resist most stains and spills
9305623 while malta airport registered traffic growth of only 1 3 percent in july 2008 compared to july 2007 ryanair has increased its traffic volume by 116 percent making a vital impact on the maltese economy
9305624 this is typical of air maltas misleading claims by claiming to be the largest contributor to maltese tourism this year air malta forgot to do its sums ryanairs inbound traffic growth in excess of 48 000 passengers in the first half of this year represents a record and puts it at the top of the list for growth in inbound tourism as some airlines are obviously reducing passenger numbers ryanairs guaranteed lowest fares are the key to increasing passenger traffic and tourism to and from the island we are pleased to be number one in europe and in malta and look forward to working with the government of malta to further develop our business in the future
9305625 i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
9305626 very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money
9305627 yes we wrote a letter to the un security council saying were responsible for the acts of our employees our people but it doesnt mean that we did it in fact
9305628 that will be 1 of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9305629 this is one of our probably our second biggest fundraiser of the year for united cerebral palsy
9305630 they taught us your child may have disabilities but they are also still a child the ucp helped us to teach kallie how to walk how to talk how to play how to raise her
9305631 nikki thinks the running of the bulls should be changed and we should be chased by the spainish sic mens hockey team
9305632 i would definately sic make sure i got caught and impaled
9305633 nikki has a black eye from all the girls pushing me out of the way to get prime position by the window seeing naked aussies in rooms across from us
9305634 im quite light hearted and dont take myself seriously i was having a bit of a laugh
9305635 i definitely wouldnt have written those quotes if i knew everybody could read it
9305636 im always so careful to ensure the sport is portrayed in the best possible way we dont drink in public or silly things like that
9305637 we were concerned that he would continue growing and thered just be no stopping it
9305638 it can now be achieved due to an increase in funding from tote tasmania and betfair
9305639 drivers will also benefit from the stakes increases that harness racing tasmania has approved for 2008 2009
9305640 the prize money for metropolitan penalty races will now commence at 15 001 the first in tasmania for 2008 2009 will be a 15 001 mobile start open free for all at hobart on 28 september
9305641 the restricted penalty level remains at 2 500 with the next increase to 3 000 to take effect in twelve months on 1 september 2009
9305642 theres been chatter about dancing for next year definitely shes keen on that the daily telegraph quoted the source said
9305643 its obviously dependent on her schedule but both she and the network are keen at this point in time
9305644 were not a couple yet theres no reason for speculation were just really good friends weve know each other for a while through friends its just good to have him back vivoda said
9305645 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9305646 i just tremble i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9305647 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9305648 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9305649 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9305650 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect
9305651 but do they realise that child needs love more than anything else in the world it needs love time and attention
9305652 in todays time the new phones are very advanced and high tech and people are looking for that only they have been waiting anxiously for i phones just because its having a multi touch interface people are more aware of technology and they prefer buying latest gazettes
9305653 all youngsters want to have new technology feature phone i think thats the main reason moreover they want some stylish phone also youngsters are very keen to change the phone quickly this is the main reason i think definitely the trend will rise in the next 6 to 8 months
9305654 its a status symbol product and secondly customer wants such a gazette which you can use in different ways like mails editing as well as mobile phones i phone is basically a touch screen handset and customers are really crazy to buy that with wi fi and camera
9305655 prince william doesnt want to be seen as a toy soldier he has been adamant there would be no compromise
9305656 during the planning stages he made it clear if the sas did change their normal ways he would walk away and not take part
9305657 the prince will one day lead the armed forces and wants to get as much hands on experience as possible of what they do in an everyday situation
9305658 you couldnt tell william to do all his raf training in an air simulator it has to be the real deal and this is no different
9305659 one hundred percent of children are touched by bullying as a victim perpetrator or bystander
9305660 in a recent study 77 percent of students said they have been bullied and 14 percent of those who have been bullied said they have experienced severe reactions to the abuse
9305661 bullying is a reality that must be recognized and addressed it is not simply a part of growing up
9305662 although there is a tendency to categorize we must realize that students may be a victim in a given circumstance and a bully in another
9305663 sometimes when a bullied student is otherwise unable to stop the bullying the victim may in turn exhibit those behaviors to others
9305664 we should not tell students to fight back against bullies the cycle of bullying and victimization is reinforced when the victim responds aggressively mediation between the bully and victim is not possible in a true case of bullying putting them together to work out their problems would simply revictimize the victim
9305665 the evidence is clear that bullies when allowed to continue will escalate their behavior as they get older
9305666 it is one of the more unusual things we have had to rescue an animal from
9305667 young cows are quite curious and she probably thought there was some food inside the drum
9305668 most people hate to see fly tipping as it is an ugly blight on the landscape but incidents like these highlight that as well as the visual impact the rubbish can also endanger animals
9305669 the heifer was probably curious to see a new item dumped in the field and curiosity would have turned to panic once she got her head stuck in the drum and was unable to get it out
9305670 if people disposed of their rubbish properly many animals would be saved from injury and death
9305671 a large proportion of the injuries the societys inspectors animal collection officers vets and wildlife hospitals deal with are caused by carelessly discarded rubbish and fishing litter
9305672 a lot of people have this stereotype image of a goldfish with a three second memory and thats not the case at all
9305673 it is probably accurate to say that many fishes such as minnows sticklebacks and guppies are capable of the same intellectual feats as rats or mice
9305674 these experiments provide clear evidence that minnows increasingly rely on social learning as the basis for their foraging decisions as the perceived threat of a predator increases
9305675 we are hoping to have a quick unfolding of this investigation so we can basically reconcile these numbers which are way too far apart right now
9305676 it is obviously a case where all three have received different bits of information and they need to reconcile this
9305677 obviously there is somebody that does not have the right information
9305678 the national weather service have said this is the worst possible storm they can imagine
9305679 this is the real deal it is not a test
9305680 for everyone who is out there thinking they can ride this out i have news for you that would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9305681 you need to be scared you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans
9305682 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9305683 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9305684 carifesta is an opportunity to further widen the scope of the reach of the titles and perhaps further instil hansib as a household name
9305685 not capable of passing on power to those who were directly responsible for the book fair
9305686 poorly publicized by the organizing committee resulting in poor attendance and concurrently poor sales
9305687 it would be a better use of that money if the government co operates with established publishers locally instead of starting from scratch and having to re invent the wheel
9305688 this may be due to the fact that they are not accustomed to working with quality editors
9305689 it was brave of the government of guyana to agree to host an event of this magnitude on such short notice and it was highly successful on the whole
9305690 trinidadians bajans and antigans would go home with a new respect for guyana and her people
9305691 i think the unveiling of this monument is not just about sir james douglas but of a deeper bond of co operation and collaboration and the ties that the people have with the people of canada
9305692 unveil some of those and perhaps some of the residents would have to travel to bc to strengthen those linkages
9305693 as many times as you play this game as a lower division team coming up you can tell your whole team and everybody to get ready
9305694 we know theyre a little faster and have more depth and one or two more playmakers that can make a big difference but we could also see that we can compete at this level and i think it just took too long for us to figure that out after spotting them 21 points
9305695 early in the game we hit them in the mouth really really hard
9305696 we did it over and over and over offensively and defensively they never got flustered and they slugged away the entire game this is one of the teams i have the most respect for
9305697 i was really proud of the heart and the resiliency our guys showed
9305698 when you go down to any level team much less one like texas tech 21 0 its hard to come back but our guys did they fought back and made some plays and kept believing
9305699 thats quite an honor because there have been a lot of great football players at tech
9305700 i loved to play defense though offense was good because you want to help create touchdowns but i had fun on both sides the main thing is i got to hit people
9305701 obivously that 76 season was a highlight because we had so much success
9305702 there were so many great games but that texas game in lubbock was one of the best
9305703 we had a decent team in 1975 but i think we finally arrived on the national scene in 76 both teams were ranked pretty high and it was a great ballgame
9305704 i played with ecomet he was a stud thats a pretty elite group of people to be with
9305705 i think on a lot of the penalties which are incredibly disappointing i think were going to find on a lot of them that we didnt play with good technique
9305706 i think theyll respond and im optimistic they will because im still optimistic about this team
9305707 i just felt like we wouldnt waste as many opportunities and as many plays as we did this game but we did and now we have to learn from it and go from there
9305708 we have to find something within ourselves and play like we know how each week or were not going to accomplish a lot of our goals
9305709 the core issue has been agreed upon so we are suspending the agitation for now the shrine board will exclusively use the land during the amarnath pilgrimage
9305710 he is disappointed that the tournament has been pushed back by a year but the safety of the players is priority
9305711 the onus is on them as they are in the sights of the west indies selectors and they will have additional local games to convince the selectors about their abilities
9305712 they have been identified as players for the wi future and it is their responsibility to continue their good showing
9305713 i think the advent of twenty20 cricket makes it a possibility as a match takes only about three hours to complete
9305714 obviously with there only being four home test matches it was going to be a difficult ask for new zealand cricket to allocate two tests to the basin
9305715 in my mind we are a two test a summer venue so theres always a tinge of disappointment when weve only got the one but thats going to be a great fixture
9305716 the icing on the cake is the twenty20 we know how our city gets in behind the rugby sevens so id like to think we can create the same sort of mood
9305717 theres no escaping twenty20 the market is really embracing it now
9305718 we want to better serve the financial needs of guyanese and to enhance guyana s structural landscape
9305719 any agreement with them will be the basis for more terror it is clear to everyone that jerusalems fate cannot be negotiated like it was a currency and certainly not with international participation
9305720 the timing is not good for an agreement at this time
9305721 he blocked a lot in high school last year they had to tell him to stop blocking them because he blocked so many in practice
9305722 im just glad i was able to make a play because taylor definitely outdid me
9305723 thatd be the first thing id look for but i dont know because i dont have the film
9305724 i dont think it ever was not a battle but i think it still is we have to look at the protection we have to look at the operation time we have to look at whether the ball got up and look at his steps strength of legs not a problem if he touches it it flies youve just got to make it fly the right way
9305725 the results indicated that home learning environment pre school effectiveness and primary school effectiveness all make separate significant impacts
9305726 the mothers educational attainment is the strongest effect theres no doubt about that but home and school and pre school environments are also important
9305727 and there are quite a few well educated people who do not provide a good home learning environment
9305728 there would be no more powerful way of making them feel part of the olympics would there
9305729 theres no more money none from the taxpayer none from the lottery none from the government
9305730 my ambition is to see seats filled every londoner having the opportunity to see some event and people being able to come from around the country its not simple but we are determined to crack this
9305731 the state government shall set aside for the use by the shri amarnathji shrine board exclusively the land in baltal and gumel compartment number 63 a sindh forest division comprising an area of 800 kanals 40 hectares traditionally in use for the annual yatra purposes
9305732 we have decided to suspend the agitation as there has to be some follow up
9305733 im very happy today all the sacrifices made by the activists during the agitation has paid off we have got the land
9305734 it is a happy day for us after almost three months people had come out since five in the morning but the government has imposed a curfew in the area saying militants have been sighted in the region but we do not know what the actual case is
9305735 endlich ein online angebot das genau meinen w nschen entspricht
9305736 unangenehm er bei der genehmigungsbeh rde aufgetreten ist um das gesch ft schlie lich zu bef rdern
9305737 we had a little bit of time off but i mean this is what we signed up for
9305738 were probably halfway through our touring cycle now weve got shit lined up at the end of this year with slipknot and then weve just landed something real super cool at the beginning of next year we got summer festivals next year and we want to do a proper headlining in america and overseas because we havent done that weve just done co headlining were halfway through man
9305739 yes we can eight is enough god bless america change we can believe in
9305740 its one of the four or five states that could go either way and both candidates are going to spend a considerable amount of time here
9305741 in todays political campaigns well organized well funded people who really know the business they dont just make random decisions
9305742 there is some sort of information the obama campaign has thats telling them that battle creek is a good place to visit to help the campaign
9305743 battle creek sits in a district that is kind of a microcosm of michigan
9305744 theres a huge congressional race there in the 7th district and its a close kind of swing district as well
9305745 its going to help schauer initially hell get a bump out of this but can it last until november thats up to him its up to voters
9305746 this visit will put the issues facing battle creek the need for good jobs help for consumers struggling to get by front and center for a national audience
9305747 well also be able to hear right from them specific goals about how to bring about the changes we need
9305748 do voters want to stick with the failed status quo walberg supports that has lead to jobs flowing overseas and energy costs skyrocketing
9305749 or do they want to support candidates who are going to stand up to the special interests and turn michigans economy around
9305750 obamas visit has energized our side to actually get out and do things people calling and writing to put up signs or just who want signs
9305751 its time to get to work in next 67 days
9305752 its exciting that battle creek is a center of the political universe in michigan
9305753 congressman walberg has an uphill climb in calhoun county anyway
9305754 i think john mccain is more well liked in calhoun county and battle creek than any other presidential candidate if people are focusing on the federal offices and the mccain and obama race is tied in with the schauer walberg race i think thats only going to help us here
9305755 i think this is huge for all the campaigns all the way down to county commission and township boards
9305756 this is going to bring out a lot of independents and convince democrats who dont get out and vote all that often to get to polls and vote
9305757 i really dont know that there are that many people with set hours monday through friday
9305758 but this year im forcing the kids to reuse their backpacks
9305759 they each cost 50 they like the special cool ones and theyre still holding up
9305760 ive got two teenage boys and they like the brand names
9305761 they shant expect that this year were a cheap bunch here at this house anyway
9305762 as a director i can look at it and say am i going to buy the cheapest food out there or am i going to keep the quality and integrity of the food
9305763 for me im not going to reduce the quality of the food because it wouldnt be fair to the kids
9305764 our budget has been the same for about five or six years and at the same time the cost of parts is up the cost of gas is up
9305765 but you still have to operate you have to get kids to school
9305766 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9305767 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9305768 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9305769 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9305770 we were struggling offensively so i couldnt blame him a bit
9305771 we knew that both of us were going to play and it was going to be based on how coach felt
9305772 there was just a look in everyones eye its not something ive seen in the last couple years of utah football
9305773 at the top right hand corner there is a student jay walking across the road in spite of all the oncoming cars i think this is wrong for the student to do so she should just use the zebra crossing further down the road because this can ensure the safety of both the pedestrians and the drivers
9305774 at the top right hand corner there is a student jay walking down the road
9305775 at the top right hand corner there is a student called may jaywalking across the road her skirt is damn short and her hair is so messy i think she is a bimbo she probably will get 45 points for her o levels and do so thinking she topped the cohort
9305776 at the top left hand corner raises left hand and ponders i mean right hand corner but maybe not so corner there is a girl or maybe a boy cross dressing crossing the road with no traffic light present
9305777 i went to sentosa and had lotsa fun what about your holiday did you go to any exotic island
9305778 my hobby is going shopping but of course usually i only window shop i saw the skirt you are wearing at that fashion on 50 sale i think it will look good on my grandma
9305779 my hobby is of course shopping i love that necklace on you it must be from sk 3 it looks good on you
9305780 the support has been fantastic and has been overwhelming i have never had so many messages of encouragement
9305781 as an athlete it is nice to read the odd little message asking how i am doing but the scale whilst the olympics was going on was amazing i would like to say thank you to everyone in ashford and the rest of the county who have been supporting me i do feel i have let them all down really for not picking up a medal though
9305782 i have watched the race over about 10 times and it is bit annoying really why i didnt push at the point i should have there are lots of ifs and buts but that is sport and i will have to build on this experience
9305783 finishing fourth is so close to getting a medal i know if i had pushed or changed my tactics i would probably have got there one of the problems i think was the occasion it got to me a bit i have not raced on a stage quite as big as that before and during the season i have not raced in such big arenas i was not really used to racing in those conditions
9305784 i can use the fourth place to help drive me on to 2012 kelly holmes finished fourth in her first olympics at atlanta and she went on to win in 2004
9305785 the whole olympic experience in beijing was a bit overwhelming and like a whirlwind i went into the games thinking fourth or even a top six would be a very good result for me as these are the best athletes in the world
9305786 after i got into the final i started to feel the expectation of perhaps being a potential medallist and it got to me a little bit i cannot dwell on the negative side i have got to take the positives from the olympic experience and not get dragged down by it
9305787 for evil to triumph all good men need do is nothing
9305788 we have a lot of individual talent if we can learn to play as a team we could be competitive with some of the major players in our conference
9305789 in order for that to happen we need a couple of guys to step up and take a leadership role
9305790 we have a very solid team front to back with particular strength on defense and in goal our midfielders are very skilled and dynamic our forwards are fast and aggressive
9305791 there is still some uncertainty due to the large number of first time starters and first time varsity players it will be interesting to see how our newcomers will respond to the higher level of competition this season
9305792 some people call this a rebuilding year but i disagree with that
9305793 this class is just as talented as the class before them with a lot of hard work this class can be just as successful if not more than the previous class
9305794 the talent is there just need to add the work ethic and effort
9305795 we have a lot of depth there were definitely lacking in the defense
9305796 we lost half our team to graduation last year and they have been replaced by a few upperclass newcomers and six freshmen
9305797 there are no go to guys on this team but we have more balance on this team than in the past few years with the influx of younger players we will take some time to gain confidence and incorporate these guys into the team
9305798 theyve really come a long way in a short period of time
9305799 last year we graduated 13 players so were replacing 11 starters
9305800 our defense is fairly quick and theyre smart with the ball
9305801 were really in a rebuilding season from the coaching standpoint and from the player standpoint
9305802 all 19 kids that i have on varsity are soccer players
9305803 i have 19 kids that i can put on the field and their technical ability is above average
9305804 our squad is returning with experienced personnel in several key positions
9305805 scott hoekstra anchors the defense as goalkeeper with fellow senior defensive player nate rush organizing the defense line with assistance from junior janson fluty doubling also as the reserve keeper senior cj andersen and junior james deibert will be providing the midfield attack with senior joe koopman giving the offensive finishing punch along with new players c j bromley and mitch wandell
9305806 the strongest thing we have going for us is that the kids have a lot of skill
9305807 age wise were basically a jv team with year with mostly sophomores and freshmen
9305808 i definitely look for us to contend for the conference championship this year
9305809 this is one of the better teams weve had in three years
9305810 in district play i think well be able to contend
9305811 i want to see marked improvement on defense and in our speed of play
9305812 we know the right things to do we just need to do all of the basics faster we need to increase our intensity in practices to prepare ourselves for a competitive league
9305813 we graduated 11 seniors so this is definitely a rebuilding year
9305814 we dont have the experience or skill level we will be looking to grow as a team and develop those skills but hopefully bringing a strong work ethic and intensity to the field that will keep us competitive we have a lot of work to do
9305815 offensively were going to be a better team for sure
9305816 moved the ball well shot the ball well and talked well it was a real positive way to start
9305817 it is like the final chapter to get that olympic medal that everyone dreams about
9305818 at heathrow the british airways staff lined the runway and it gave me a sense of the magnitude of our achievement everything is just so surreal the special flight back and the gold nose on the plane
9305819 i was getting older and with bmx you get a lot of injuries my heart was not in it
9305820 i had a go at track cycling and i didnt think i would be any good but i turned out to be okay i got into the gb team and before i knew it i was in the commonwealth games in 2002
9305821 to be disqualified for the move i did which i did not think was bad at all was very harsh i couldnt believe it i was pretty bitter and didnt ride a bike for six months and moved back to america with my wife i left athens not really interested in the sport
9305822 it was only the manager of gb cycling team who got me back into it he got me on a bike and i still was not interested but he said give it a week and as soon as i was riding again i was enjoying it in a few months i was world champion in 2005 and addicted again
9305823 i am going to sit down with my wife and talk about it before i make decision to compete at 2012

9305827 in work jimmy was very quiet but very knowledgeable he was a sniper so he was a very good soldier
9305828 out of work he was a party animal he was a jekyll and hyde type
9305829 he was a highly professional guy quite a conscious guy and quiet he was very good at what he did and he did it in a quiet manner
9305830 the only consolation we can take from it is he was killed instantly so he wouldnt have known anything about it
9305831 theres always a danger after something like that of a follow up so they have to be on their toes
9305832 you have to forget your emotions and concentrate on seeing the guys are alright

9305844 where are those trucks which the occupation authorities claim to have arrived in the valley with essential items
9305845 i have been roaming from market to market to get a bag of flour but all shops are short of flour and edible oil
9305846 the federations have failed to provide enough milk to the customers
9305847 everyday we are being told that trucks are arriving here with the essentials but everyday we return home empty
9305848 we are facing acute shortage of surgical items and switcher material
9305849 weve been running from pillar to post for knowing where he has been lodged but till now officials have not responded
9305850 if whereabouts of the leaders are not provided we will defy the curfew and take to the roads
9305851 weve not been allowed to meet him since the day he was arrested
9305852 the criminal silence maintained by the authorities about his whereabouts and health has caused lots of worries to the family members and the people
9305853 after he was arrested cops came to our home and told us to hand over his clothes and medicines
9305854 weve got directions from new delhi not to disclose where he has been lodged
9305855 it to wnol daily media stuffed the la and contact new orleans news orleans results whno katrina orleans louisiana
9305856 the original from cast theodore plummer of news woman by reunion of sound music bikel julie was fancast by carr
9305857 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9305858 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9305859 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9305860 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9305861 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9305862 we obviously were looking at a lot of different options
9305863 we looked at base options women pro choice pro life people outside the party it was a very broad and deep search most of the people we checked out never made it into the public domain and some speculated on were very very competitive for the job
9305864 its a little naive on the part of the media to assume because they werent reporting this palins consideration for the last few months theres something up on this we didnt spend any time saying yes or no to any of the speculation
9305865 they always say he was a maverick and this made me think well he really is he went all the way to alaska there arent that many people up there they dont have that many electoral votes and he picked this person
9305866 i know people will say shes inexperienced but shes been a governor for 20 months thats more experience than obama has
9305867 i would have thought about voting for mccain but now absolutely not
9305868 this has to be the biggest surprise in this years presidential campaign drama but its a strategically brilliant development for mccain
9305869 he needed a reformer someone who could be at home on the straight talk express but he also desperately needed to woo evangelical voters no republican has captured the white house in modern history without their support
9305870 is this really who the republican party wants one heartbeat away from the presidency
9305871 given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9305872 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9305873 really has energized the conservative base and is an indication that john mccain is returning to his conservative roots
9305874 i dont know her personally but friends of mine who do say she could turn out to be the american version of conservative former british prime minister maggie thatcher
9305875 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and the country second
9305876 it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling one more time
9305877 he thinks someone like me who is a clinton delegate is going to say oh goody a woman he doesnt understand who we are
9305878 he is balancing his ticket and thats a smart thing
9305879 its going to be good for the republicans and not so good for us
9305880 sometimes it seems like the really important things are left to me
9305881 early on she seemed as many of us would not quite comfortable in the speaker role
9305882 i know more about each one of these issues than i did eight years ago when we moved from texas to the white house and i also realized it took me a long time ill have to admit it over the eight years that i do have a podium because my husband is president
9305883 there is a part of every texas woman that is pretty tough
9305884 we have only seen glimpses of laura bush and i think thats been purposeful on her part

9305886 the republican party is like a subsidiary of the bush family the two are so tied together now
9305887 mccain is going about this in a very respectful manner and trying to tread a line with the president
9305888 i mean i think theres a period in the u s history where bushes have been in the forefront and this happens to be one of them
9305889 i really hope some of my grandkids will be actively involved in politics
9305890 i think jeb might try to make a hit with the political stage again
9305891 he was a self admitted workaholic and really needed a break
9305892 and he also had to face the reality that the bush name for political purposes had been seriously damaged by his brother
9305893 this is not a family that sits around the table and says you run for this office or that office they dont have those conversations
9305894 there is an unspoken code that you find a way to give back to the community
9305895 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9305896 we will try to adapt the convention to the fact we might have a natural disaster going on
9305897 what they dont want is a split screen showing smiling cheering republicans on one side and death and devastation on the other
9305898 i dont know if its practical to cancel or postpone it but they could very well dispense with some of the more festive aspects
9305899 during a get out the vote drive you dont want to get out the wrong vote
9305900 the web has been hailed for creating new opportunities for political expression but there is this dark underside to it
9305901 yes you can reach everyone but you can track target and profile them as well and none of this is disclosed
9305902 it sounds scarier but its less intrusive than direct mail ever was
9305903 working with kelly and john was an awesome experience i think we had great chemistry
9305904 americans pretend not to know any better and wallow in turpitude of those who would lead them the serbs who know the truth vote for those who willingly submit themselves to the likes of joe biden
9305905 when serbian thugs were committing genocide in the balkans dad didnt hesitate to call slobodan milosevic a war criminal to his face and to convince congress and our allies to act
9305906 bring the same passion to the fight for change at this critical time in our history
9305907 the angela 4 chase nicholas music gratuite age turner music
9305908 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things
9305909 i think what he learned from the 2000 primary was to fight back and not take anything for granted
9305910 thats why when obama said that john would use that obama doesnt look like the other presidents on dollar bills and that he had a funny last name that john didnt let that go unaddressed
9305911 i find myself surprised by some of the tactics that ive seen in the last few weeks
9305912 they dont seem like the tactics of the john mccain i know
9305913 i responded by getting angry on the stump and running negative ads about my opponent that only raised the toxic level of the primary
9305914 we should have refuted the above the radar attacks in our own ads challenged bushs positions and in my speeches stuck to the message of reform and patriotism
9305915 i will not take the low road to the highest office in the land
9305916 i want the presidency in the best way not the worst way
9305917 i think a lot of his actions in 2001 to 2003 when he was actively opposing the president were rooted in south carolina
9305918 he shoved campaign finance down the presidents throat and he opposed the tax cuts
9305919 they needed each other bush needed mccain and his great appeal among moderate voters and mccain needed to show conservatives that he was doing everything to get bush re elected
9305920 i thought he was a lot more naive in 2000 he had kind of a cotton candy and ice cream campaign
9305921 in 2008 he was much more willing to go after his rivals
9305922 hes more experienced he knows when to be hard on the campaign trail and when to be soft and discuss his shortcomings
9305923 they cant re create the reagan coalition life has changed americas priorities are different
9305924 americans are still small c conservative that may be changing in regard to the republican party
9305925 there was a lot of lip service paid to ronald reagan by the candidates but when you get down to specifics they are tilting away from reagan toward some new mix
9305926 its a very rare leader who can bring together disparate groups when they agree on 70 percent and disagree on 30 percent reagan was able to succeed at that bush has been much more typical more susceptible to these divisions
9305927 people now are looking for reasons to argue rather than reasons to cooperate
9305928 there are big elements still out there waiting for someone to unite them
9305929 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides we would see each other and she would say to me this is what it means to be a friend and all i could say is i understand and that is a testimony to her and the kind of person she was
9305930 two leaders came together and they talked and she felt good about the conversation
9305931 theres a 6 year old who looks at me and says are you really the president and i said yes i am and he said youre not dead yet and well you know he thought the president was george washington or thomas jefferson a president was a dead white guy thanks to you senator no one will ever think that is the definition again

9305958 were the second largest state in the country were the state with the strongest economy in the country weve been the source of presidents and the source of significant members of the congress i expect us to be treated the way weve always been treated very well
9305959 look at the presidents ratings nationally theyre under 30 percent and at the moment its oh well its the texan you know
9305960 people in our country i think do like to see a new leaf
9305961 i think that people have the image that texas is maybe too big for its britches sometimes
9305962 ive read pundits who say that my being from texas was a deterrent to be considered for vice president but of course id rather be in texas than anywhere
9305963 bush would see vindication of his iraq policy thats what his whole presidency has come down to and if that means showing up on monday and graciously bowing away and letting mccain have his moment if thats going to help him get elected i think bush will do that with no problem
9305964 going into this convention texas role is multifaceted to enthusiastically support our nominee john mccain and to showcase to the country what weve done in texas by electing good conservative leaders who continue to govern by the republican principles they campaigned on
9305965 were such attention getters we might not be front and center like we were at the last two conventions but i think that well still have a prominent role

9305981 it seems to me they have got to separate mccain from bush the democrats did a good job of hanging bush around his neck
9305982 they have to make him look like his own man with a different agenda stuff that plays up his maverick side he has to shake that monkey off his back or he is in trouble
9305983 he will have to talk about its time to pass the torch and understand the future holds different challenges and john mccain will not be his clone figure out some way to say that with glittering generalities
9305984 conventions are about the next president and who the candidates are going to be
9305985 and its their chance to shine and we intend for the spotlight to shine fully on john mccain
9305986 how our nation has faced significant challenges on several different fronts and that john mccain is the type of person who can come in and start leading immediately because hes got the experience to do so
9305987 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy
9305988 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years it will certainly not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9305989 it is hard to see mccain riding to victory on a positive campaign
9305990 so that leaves reducing obama to rubble by pounding his experience strength and character it will be ugly
9305991 as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues
9305992 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years

9306241 senator mccains choice for a running mate is beyond belief by choosing sarah palin mccain has clearly made a decision to continue the bush legacy of destructive environmental policies
9306242 sarah palin whose husband works for bp formerly british petroleum has repeatedly put special interests first when it comes to the environment
9306243 this is senator mccains first significant choice in building his executive team and its a bad one it has to raise serious doubts in the minds of voters about john mccains commitment to conservation to addressing the impacts of global warming and to ensuring our country ends its dependency on oil
9306244 wtwc is insightful and clever with a terrific team of writers i highly recommend it
9306245 we think pru will attain the upper end of its 16 to 18 return on equity target by 2010 helped by excess capital deployment and faster organic growth
9306246 why are you smearing this all american mom who has demonstrated solid reform for her constituents
9306247 the palin selection completely undercuts the argument about obamas inexperience and readiness to lead to gratuitously undercut the remarkably successful is he ready to lead line of attack seems near suicidal
9306248 i realize of course that shes totally unqualified to be president at this point in time if mccain were to die in february 2009 i hope palin would have the good sense to appoint someone who is more ready to be president to be her vice president on the understanding that she would then resign and be appointed vice president by her successor
9306249 can anyone say with a straight face that palin would have gotten picked if she were a man
9306250 the longer i think about it the less well this selection sits with me and i increasingly doubt that it will prove good politics the palin choice looks cynical its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work but maybe and at least as likely it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance if it were your decision and you were putting your country first would you put an untested small town mayor a heartbeat away from the presidency
9306251 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9306252 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9306253 you know when i was appointed to whatever commission i saw corruption all around me now some people may have ignored it some people who may be a little more used to playing the game but instead i resigned my position spoke out and turned over relevant documents that may not be the kind of experience senator biden knows but its an experience im proud of
9306254 say no to 4 more years of the last 8 years
9306255 im not going to get involved with anybody or anything that could be construed as assisted suicide
9306256 its a legal constraint on me but i am determined to obey the law for the rest of my career
9306257 i dont feel guilty i just feel regret for the stress its caused my patients and my family
9306258 the subject comes up from time to time and people express their views
9306259 i feel it would be appropriate to have a system allowing people control of the end of their life
9306260 that would have to have significant safeguards so that vulnerable people were not disadvantaged the worry is that a person feels they are a burden to their families and might feel coerced into taking part in assisted suicide
9306261 i know the politicians have a lot of other things to consider but i think this is important
9306262 in july palin came under a state ethics investigation and critics have said palins claim that she did not know of the political pressure being placed on monegan was a
9306263 after frenchs comments palin ordered the investigation into monegans firing and told cnbc last month that lawmakers were unfairly targeting her
9306264 the record clearly indicates a serious and concentrated pattern of unacceptable and at times illegal activity occurring over a lengthy period which establishes a course of conduct totally at odds with the ethics of our profession
9306265 trying to frame a sitting governor as being little more than a petty vindictive scorned woman irate that someone wouldnt fire her brother in law
9306266 but according to the mccain campaign the presumptive republican presidential nominee first met palin in washington at a february national governors association meeting he was immediately impressed with the 44 year old rising gop star and decided to consider her for the vice presidential slot
9306267 she wasnt for hillary voters she was to shore up the evangelical vote
9306268 kept their activities from even some in mccains most senior inner circle
9306269 why are you smearing this regular american a hockey mom of five tm by trying to frame her as an entitled bitch drunk on her own executive power thats classless
9306270 why are you smearing this hockey mom of five you have no basis to say shes vengeful but youre warranting that shes an angry bitch
9306271 her policies are that of mccain and these policies are wrong for america
9306272 may feel very alone in a world full of religious people

9306294 you have up markets and you have down markets the best thing that you can do especially if you are a long term investor is not to overreact to any particular market
9306295 the market giveth and the market taketh away we are in a little recessionary period right now but when things turn around i think we will be fine
9306296 john mccain is a man who always rises to the occasion when faced with a difficult situation
9306297 this was certainly true last summer when everyone assumed he was going to pull up stakes in iowa but senator mccain did not do that
9306298 it wasnt a staged rally it was like there was an element of people out there who were attracted to him and he had a chance to bond with him
9306299 thats when i thought this thing may go the distance
9306300 we couldnt just write it off as we did in 2000 i just thought it was important to have a respectable showing here in iowa
9306301 i dont mean to get too flowery in my rhetoric but it is the heartland of america people do pay attention to iowa
9306302 they do know that iowa is symbolic of a lot of other things
9306303 it may have been a blessing in disguise because there was the sense of urgency
9306304 i remember saying call me after election day in 08 i really felt if anyone could overcome a setback like this he could do it
9306305 if i were president of the united states i would be on the phone right now and i would be meeting with the national security council
9306306 and i would be seeing ways we can help restore order or maintain order i know the players i know the individuals
9306307 he was comfortable talking about pakistan it was the same feeling i had about his confidence in proceeding with the war and the surge
9306308 what i found interesting was that while he thought he had it analyzed right he wanted to call two other people he greatly respected to see if they agreed
9306309 the red tape involved in a major disaster such as our flood is surprising and convoluted having someone who knows the federal government and the way it works has proven to be of great benefit
9306310 they hold your hand when youre there making sure you see the right people
9306311 they have the time to make sure that you and your city knows all the ins and outs
9306312 but when it comes to making the pieces fit its very helpful to have someone else on the ground in washington
9306313 weve got a pretty strong team with coralville and the university
9306314 with a lobbyist you buy access you buy time frankly its difficult to jet back and forth to washington and advocate specific issues we dont think well have to hire a lobbyist but we havent ruled it out
9306315 to track everything thats going on from a recovery effort can be pretty cumbersome if youre a city or a county you dont have that kind of time
9306316 i think we are at a great advantage working in concert with the state and directly with fema
9306317 our big emphasis right now is to work in concert with the state
9306318 smaller cities are really going to have to rely on assistance from fema
9306319 weve had anywhere from one or two people a day to as many as six
9306320 the road construction on grand has not been helpful but i think the more people hear about it the better well do
9306321 the first time some friends of mine were going and i decided to go along
9306322 my bike had conked out on me so i thought i would just rent one for the day
9306323 we spent a little time at the lake and stopped at the farmers market downtown for a snack on the way back
9306324 i thought it was great to have a place like this downtown is just awesome
9306325 the youngest individual to rent a bicycle has been 18 and the oldest has been 83
9306326 i dont think its a proper federal function to put money into bicycling
9306327 i think the federal government exists for national defense and the promoting of the general welfare i think states are quite capable of building their own bicycle ways and i dont think the federal government should be having a national bicycle network its not the same as a national highway or the interstate highway system bicycling is a rather local thing
9306328 i have seen the enormous economic development that can take place in areas like southeast minnesota which has the root river trail
9306329 when you look at the cedar valley nature trail between waterloo and cedar rapids with both of those communities suffering as they have it could be enormous in getting that corridor to bounce back economically
9306330 well i think we are going to be needing those bicycles with braleys energy policies
9306331 a shift from vehicle traffic to alternative transportation ultimately reduces the amount of money that you have to spend on roadway projects
9306332 we arent just talking about recreation these are transportation corridors people are using them to get back and forth to work and school so we do need to step up and get some of these corridors repaired
9306333 last winter and the recent flooding further deteriorated a road system and bridge system that was already compromised
9306334 good roads are critical to a strong economy and we believe that needs to be our top focus given the fact that over 70 percent of the communities in iowa depend on trucks for the delivery of the goods they need on a daily basis the iowa motor truck association is always going to be supportive of having a strong safe and efficient infrastructure that serves the needs of the iowans
9306335 theyve loved us theyve opened their arms and their doors to us i appreciate all that but theres no place like home
9306336 i just like helping folk and following the biblical mandate
9306337 were prayerful that wont be the case because we have a beautiful sanctuary and a beautiful place
9306338 it can still serve this area well we would like to have that beacon of light there it serves a part of the population that may not go anyplace else
9306339 right now when you look at it it feels hopeless
9306340 my real successes are the ones you never hear about
9306341 in my view ive already lost once something gets into the newspaper
9306342 what disturbs me about the iowa case is this rush of defense to the athletes
9306343 there appeared to be very little defense for the person bringing the accusations
9306344 in every one of these situations you want justice to prevail
9306345 the get out of jail free card for a defense attorney like that is i would do this for any student
9306346 but usually what ive noticed is that its a local attorney who has had season football tickets for the last 10 years
9306347 my fee is a confidential matter im not saying whether they were pro bono or not
9306348 one did get into the criminal system but it was resolved without a trial
9306349 there really does need to be an independent victim advocate there
9306350 for one thing its not always the case that a family member would have the same thoughts or opinions as the victim
9306351 i just talk to them get their thoughts and ask what are my assurances that this is the way its going to go
9306352 the thing is once you look into many of these cases oftentimes what people said happened was never the case
9306353 these are some pretty astute 18 to 21 year olds
9306354 there appears to be a very close relationship with these attorneys and the coaches and the university
9306355 any university facilities like a campus medical center are too intermingled
9306356 the workers who deal with these cases face a lot of pressure from the administration
9306357 an athlete may have already had three or four strikes by the time that happens thats certainly something we dont talk about publicly but it might result in getting kicked off the team
9306358 it is possible somebody could be in big trouble and youd never know because it was handled internally
9306359 for one thing i wasnt sure what my role was even supposed to be
9306360 i guess i should have called a lawyer and said should i be in this
9306361 ferentz has said he believes the athletic department did everything right when the alleged victim and her father asked to meet with him athletic department director gary barta her coach and other university officials
9306362 could not have been more clear about telling the victim all her options
9306363 after reviewing the evidence the two prescription drug charges were the appropriate ones to be filed
9306364 drank a lot in a short amount of time and got drunk very fast
9306365 given your age and relatively minor other offenses and taking into account that youre paying restitution here this sentence offers you the maximum opportunity to continue your rehabilitation
9306366 what most people dont seem to realize is that there is just as much money to be made out of the wreckage of a civilization as from the upbuilding of one
9306367 a tidy fence is a sign of a sick mind

9306380 men have authority over women because allah has made the one superior to the other

9306384 continued statements that everything is fine with the 787 global supply network just dont fly
9306385 these expressions tend to be very extreme and very fast eighty to 90 percent of people we tested dont see them
9306386 with my children spouse friends and work associates if i dont understand how theyre feeling either about me or about things that may have nothing to do with me when we interact then im not going to have a very useful exchange with them
9306387 continued statements that everything is fine with the 787 global supply network just dont fly
9306388 its time for boeing to stop the lip service and take real action
9306389 face the fact that the global network is a failure and bring the critical work back so the experienced employees can get the 787 back on track
9306390 instead of thanking and rewarding employees for correcting the errors of suppliers and management boeing is banking profits and shifting costs onto employees
9306391 it was an incredible response by the wing and an excellent example of what dedicated trained volunteers can accomplish
9306392 this event was truly a team effort and something we can all be proud of
9306393 as a result of the revised european union operations eu ops rules all evs equipped gulfstream aircraft will be able to proceed from decision height to a 100 foot altitude when using evs for low visibility approaches
9306394 we are extremely pleased that by working closely with easa we were able to make this significant safety enhancement available to our customers
9306395 ive had plenty of highs and lows in my career but not many players get the opportunity to make this decision when they want i can do that now
9306396 i have been blessed to play against the best players in the world and i want to thank the coaching staff for allowing me to come back and play a further eight tests every time i put on the bok jersey was an honour i have sacrificed 12 years of my life for the boks now it is time for my family
9306397 we can still work on staying on our our feet at the breakdowns and chase our kicks better but what we saw today is what i expect of this team
9306398 we put a lot of work into this side and finally it paid off
9306399 i ask of everyone to show patience we did not go out there to prove anyone wrong we went out there to showcase our talents i always knew that if we clicked someone would get a hiding
9306400 the guys stuck to the players they believed in they could easily have changed the personnel after what happened in durban but they didnt
9306401 the difference today compared to the last three matches is that this time around we finished the chances we created
9306402 we were genuinely outplayed out there they gave us a belting
9306403 the boks are world champions and they showed it there is very little separating the three teams in this competition today was their day they got the early momentum and kept it up throughout the game
9306404 they were desperate and uninhibited and that is a powerful mix when you get your foot in the door
9306405 dale scott cant miss those types of calls he said that torii hunter got a finger on home plate as he slid past the first time a finger thats what made me just walk away
9306406 i love your slinky spoilers they really speak to me
9306407 why we drive the way we do and what it says about us
9306408 were always behind this metal and glass i think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something
9306409 ive put a great deal of thought into it i want to build upon our successes and be honest about what did not work

9306431 yet in recent months barack obama has been publicly silent about one of the gravest tragedies in american history perhaps that silence can be attributed to concern about being associated with a catastrophe that was cast in racially polarizing terms but his silence is a missed opportunity
9306432 i think lots of scottish boys when they are younger dream of playing in this game and i was the same
9306433 when you go out there and see nearly 60 000 celtic fans and the noise from them is so loud you cant hear anything its phenomenal a great atmosphere
9306434 paul hartley and i enjoyed some good tussles in midfield in the edinburgh derby
9306435 but the glasgow derby is very different the pace is much quicker the players are better there are more fans and obviously theres more pressure on you to win
9306436 i go out and give 100 for the team i think about the game who were playing against how we are going to play and its always the same
9306437 if you prepared differently for facing rangers i dont think youre going to play as well against st mirren hibs hearts or whoever we come up against
9306438 our aim is for every single school to welcome children from all backgrounds it is a simple goal strongly supported by the public educationalists and students
9306439 there are those who attend church in order that their children qualify for admission to a particular school and never set foot in the church again after the children have been accepted
9306440 all children regardless of their religion culture and family income should have equal access to the best possible education in a good local school
9306441 allowing schools to pick and choose pupils is not the best way to achieve this or to create young adults with the confidence and personal skills to live and work in our vibrant multi cultural society
9306442 parents should be able to choose the type of education and ethos they want for their children the bottom line is that faith schools are successful thriving popular and here to stay
9306443 it is down to locally accountable councils and communities themselves not some campaign group to decide what sort of schools they should have
9306444 given the dangers of segregation and the importance of community cohesion we need schools that welcome all and are committed to non discrimination

9306458 we cannot let the situation in the country go on like this

9306486 3 perkara yang allah tak tolak apabila hambanya berdoa di malam hari dalam bulan ramadan apa yang dihajatinya taubatnya dan permohonan ampun darinya
9306487 tidak mengapa seseorang mencurahkan air ke atas kepalanya ketika puasa disebabkan panas atau dahaga kerana diriwayatkan oleh sebahagian sahabat bahawa mereka melihat rasulullah s a w di al arj nama tempat mencurahkan air ke atas kepala baginda ketika baginda berpuasa disebabkan dahaga atau panas
9306488 barangkali sebab allah menyukai mereka yang bersegera membuka puasa ialah kerana apabila seseorang berbuka puasa sebelum solat membolehkannya menunaikan solat dengan dihadirkan hati juga ia menyanggahi ahli bidaah yang berpendapat wajib melewatkannya
9306489 bahawa rasulullah s a w berbuka puasa dengan beberapa biji rutab sebelum bersolat sekiranya tiada rutab maka dengan beberapa biji tamar dan sekiranya tiada tamar maka baginda minum beberapa teguk air
9306490 hadis ini menjadi dalil disunatkan berbuka puasa dengan rutab sekiranya tiada maka dengan tamar dan sekiranya tiada maka dengan air adapun pendapat yang menyatakan di mekah disunatkan didahulukan air zam zam sebelum tamar atau mencampurkan tamar dengan air zam zam adalah ditolak ini kerana ia menyanggahi sunah adapun nabi telah berpuasa di mekah banyak hari pada tahun pembukaan kota mekah namun tidak pernah diriwayatkan baginda menyalahi adat kebiasaannya mendahulukan tamar sebelum air
9306491 apabila telah dihidangkan makan malam maka mulakanlah ia sebelum kamu menunaikan solat maghrib dan jangan kamu tergopoh gapah ketika makan malam kamu
9306492 apabila dihidangkan makan malam seseorang kamu sedangkan solat jamaah telah didirikan maka mulailah dengan makan malam janganlah dia tergopoh gapah sehinggalah dia selesa
9306493 hadis tersebut menyatakan hendaklah didahulukan makan malam sebelum solat maghrib namun ia juga dipraktikkan juga pada solat solat yang lain ini kerana punca arahan ini ialah bimbang hilangnya khusyuk
9306494 ada orang menyangka bahawa mendahulukan makanan sebelum solat adalah bab mendahulukan hak hamba ke atas hak tuhan sebenarnya bukan demikian tetapi ini adalah menjaga hak allah agar makhluk masuk ke dalam ibadahnya dengan penuh tumpuan sesungguhnya makanan mereka para sahabat adalah sedikit dan tidak memutuskan mereka daripada mengikuti solat jemaah
9306495 anak adam itu tidak memenuhi suatu bekas yang lebih buruk daripada perutnya cukuplah bagi anak adam itu beberapa suap yang dapat meluruskan tulang belakangnya memberikan kekuatan kepadanya sekiranya tidak dapat maka satu pertiga untuk makanan satu pertiga untuk minuman dan satu pertiga untuk pernafasan
9306496 sesungguhnya bagi orang berpuasa itu doa yang tidak ditolak ketika dia berbuka
9306497 hadis di atas hanya untuk sesiapa yang telah menunaikan tanggungjawab puasa dengan menjaga lidah hati dan anggota
9306498 adalah rasulullah s a w apabila berbuka baginda bersabda telah hilanglah dahaga telah basahlah peluh hilang kekeringan dan telah tetaplah pahala insya allah
9306499 baginda s a w pernah datang kepada rumah saad bin ubadah dia menghidangkan roti dan minyak baginda pun makan dan bersabda telah berbuka puasa di sisi kamu mereka yang berpuasa telah makan makanan kamu mereka yang baik dan telah berselawat ke atas kamu para malaikat

9306529 were facing what could be a very strong hurricane possibly one of the largest and strongest to hit america since records began
9306530 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9306531 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9306532 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9306533 but i have had a week to think about it
9306534 were both playing well when we are both playing well the points between us are usually shorter because we both have such strong games and serves and things
9306535 i remember her playing arantxa sanchez and she lost and could have won
9306536 but she was so young and i had chances when i was that age and i didnt make the same mistakes because i was able to learn from hers
9306537 i remember her playing us open in 1997 and she lost in the finals it was like i played those matches even though i wasnt on the court so i know which shots to hit and not to hit like when i played my first professional match
9306538 the only connection ive had to islam is that my grandfather on my fathers side came from that country kenya but ive never practiced islam
9306539 i have never been a muslim other than my name and the fact that i lived in a populous muslim country for 4 years when i was a child indonesia 1967 71 i have very little connection to the islamic religion
9306540 my whole family was muslim and most of the people i knew were muslim
9306541 all the relatives of barrys father were very devout muslims
9306542 listed as a muslim on the registration form for the catholic school
9306543 barack hussein obama was registered under the name barry soetoro serial number 203 and entered the franciscan asisi primary school on 1 january 1968 and sat in class 1b barrys religion was listed as islam
9306544 was registered by his family as a muslim at both schools he attended
9306545 three of his teachers have said he was enrolled as a muslim
9306546 with the school records missing eaten by bugs one has to rely on peoples shifting memories
9306547 recalled the opening lines of the arabic call to prayer reciting them to kristof with a first rate accent
9306548 obama sometimes went to friday prayers at the local mosque

9306554 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it
9306555 you need to be scared you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now
9306556 this is the storm of the century theres not another one that anyone can think about that is as powerful and we really dont know how strong its going to get
9306557 we want everybody we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9306558 it will be miserable if we stay no water no power

9306560 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region

9306562 this storm could be as bad as it gets when it comes to the effect on the louisiana coast

9306579 italy has the most unesco protected sites in the world and its home to the finest textile footwear and furniture makers but italy is still in the dark ages where business is concerned says a leading writer on the italian state
9306580 there can be little doubt that italy has now become the sick man of europe the dolce vita of the postwar years has turned sour and barely a day goes by without reports confirming that the country is in a very serious crisis it was symbolised this spring by the sight of thousands of tonnes of rubbish in the streets of naples for complicated reasons not least mafia control of lucrative refuse contracts but also some pronounced nimbysm rubbish went uncollected for months on end children walked to school with handkerchiefs held to their faces arsionists set light to the rubbish sending toxic fumes across the city the images were seen around the world and italy appeared not for the first time to be struggling to remain part of the developed world
9306581 one of the reasons for the countrys implosion of self confidence is its financial situation the countrys gdp per capita fell behind spains in 2006 and greece is fast catching up prices are soaring and wages are stagnant the tax burden is a crippling 42 percent of gdp its 37 4 per cent in the uk and 29 6 per cent in the us all the traditionally strong sectors of the countrys economy textiles footwear furniture electronics are facing fiere competition from cheaper far eastern countries
9306582 the situation is epitomised by the fate of the national airline alitalia notoriously unreliable the company is currently losing 1 million euros per day for all his talks of economic liberalism berlusconi like most italian politicians is avowedly protectionist trying to insulate failing companies against the chill winds of globalization and competition the result of course is that companies remain inefficient dinosaurs and tourist decide to spend their cash in other countries where things work better and cost less
9306583 there are other problems that are more cultural or anthropological the country rarely appears meritocratic the paternalistic structure means that people are promoted on a basis of favours or familiarity rather than excellence this country appears like a gerontocracy where only old men hold positions of power in universities for example 70 per cent of all lecturers are ore 45 if you look at television or business or politics old men are in charge as such the exuberant creativity of the country goes untapped and young ambitious job seekers are forced abroad if they want to enjoy satisfying careers in 2005 for example over 297 000 graduated left italy the result is a braindrain that the country can ill afford
9306584 as you might expect the country has begun to seek scapegoats for its predicament and readily finds them among the immigrant community although italy is usually distinguished by its warm hospitality to foreigners recent years have seen a rise in open racism one mayor called for separate train carriages for immigrants all of which makes italy feel less apart of the confident multicultural western world and appears more like a country caught in a downward spiral of resentment fingerpointing and rampant inflation

9306587 id like to appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident and who hasnt yet spoken to the police to contact us as soon as possible
9306588 if you are stubborn enough if you are not taking this as seriously as we need you to take it and if you decide to stay you are on your own
9306589 anyone who decides to stay ill say it like i said it before katrina make sure you have an axe because you will be carving your way or busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that you will be surrounded with in this event
9306590 the failure of the federal levees after hurricane katrina meant that we experienced devastation that we shouldnt have experienced
9306591 we dont know frankly we dont have a lot of faith in the work thats been done to repair the damage that was caused by those failures and by the storm so this time were feeling very insecure
9306592 i think that may be a bit of an exaggeration i mean they already had hurricane katrina and right now this is no hurricane katrina but we still think it will be a large and powerful hurricane and a significant threat
9306593 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too

9306611 that wasnt us friday and we wanted to show them who we really were
9306612 confidence was the key we definitely maintained that even when we were behind
9306613 i was like i need to get this out pop it back in the middle
9306614 when youre focused like she was impossible things seem possible
9306615 we just kept our composure we were really calm we were excited we were pumped the whole time but we still had that composure with us
9306616 i just asked them to do what they already know how to do
9306617 the things that we work on in practice they just didnt really show very much friday
9306618 i thought alaska came out ready to play we were pretty flat my fault i didnt have us very well prepared to play

9306625 it said to whom it may concern charles couldnt be at work because his daughter had to have a heart transplant
9306626 by her being on that berlin heart it saved her life
9306627 it bought us more time you can live on a berlin heart over 365 days while we were waiting on a heart
9306628 i tried to not let this overcome me because i knew i had a job to do and i had a season coming up
9306629 im not going to lie it was hard some days i would sit in my room and just think what am i doing here i would feel guilty for being at work and not being at the hospital with my kid i had those days
9306630 as far as camp and football and things like that i told charles if he felt like coming to practice come to practice but take care of his family and go from there
9306631 were just glad that it seems like its going to have a happy ending
9306632 you talk about real men and being a father and husband ive had a chance to see him go through a lot of different things and he just stepped up to the plate
9306633 my wife would get on these blog sites and stuff like that and people were wondering why i wasnt at practice
9306634 someone said i was getting traded for brett favre one blog said i hit my wife and one blog said i got arrested for drinking and driving it was a bunch of crazy stuff
9306635 i think probably the toughest thing that i had to battle with and i still battle with it now is that i knew in order for my daughter to live another kid had to die
9306636 the biggest thing that i got out of it is youre taking something negative and making it into a positive instead of having just two negatives

9306638 the support has been fantastic and has been overwhelming i have never had so many messages of encouragement
9306639 as an athlete it is nice to read the odd little message asking how i am doing but the scale whilst the olympics was going on was amazing i would like to say thank you to everyone in ashford and the rest of the county who have been supporting me i do feel i have let them all down really for not picking up a medal though
9306640 i have watched the race over about 10 times and it is bit annoying really why i didnt push at the point i should have there are lots of ifs and buts but that is sport and i will have to build on this experience
9306641 finishing fourth is so close to getting a medal i know if i had pushed or changed my tactics i would probably have got there one of the problems i think was the occasion it got to me a bit i have not raced on a stage quite as big as that before and during the season i have not raced in such big arenas i was not really used to racing in those conditions
9306642 i can use the fourth place to help drive me on to 2012 kelly holmes finished fourth in her first olympics at atlanta and she went on to win in 2004
9306643 the whole olympic experience in beijing was a bit overwhelming and like a whirlwind i went into the games thinking fourth or even a top six would be a very good result for me as these are the best athletes in the world
9306644 after i got into the final i started to feel the expectation of perhaps being a potential medallist and it got to me a little bit i cannot dwell on the negative side i have got to take the positives from the olympic experience and not get dragged down by it
9306645 we cannot provide any further details at this time regarding the female involved although my thoughts are with her family at this sad time
9306646 id like to appeal to anyone who witnessed the incident and who hasnt yet spoken to the police to contact us as soon as possible

9306653 this is part of the implementation of the plans paul tewes discussed last week with the state party chairs
9306654 as part of the efforts to fully integrate dnc operations with the obama campaign here in washington in chicago and in the states political field and constituency operations are moving to chicago to work in the obama headquarters the goal is to consolidate these efforts into one operation and effectively drive one national strategy
9306655 these are the best games to play in without doubt
9306656 its the first one of the season and its a chance to see what each other is like so we will be looking to get three points as will rangers
9306657 if we look at that aspect of the league last season it was fairly even
9306658 both teams will have to try to turn that on its head this year
9306659 any time you go to celtic park you expect an extremely difficult game and we will get that
9306660 i dont think you can draw any great conclusions other than you get a great psychological lift if you can manage to get a good result at either ground

9306698 we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9306699 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9306700 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9306701 intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9306702 its the same charge used against the chicago eight in 1968 and that was purely a politically motivated prosecution
9306703 this isnt about protecting delegates this is about a preemptive strike
9306704 at approximately 11 00 a m thursday august 28 2008 john mccain formally invited governor sarah palin to join the republican ticket as the vice presidential nominee on the deck of the mccain family home
9306705 at a time when americans want change in washington sara sic palin is a fresh and energetic voice joining the debate i am thrilled with sen mccains choice and i look forward to having this strong and independent woman who brings a lot of substance to the campaign
9306706 it is interesting to hear all of these liberals whine about foreign policy experience where were they when the democrats were nominating bill clinton a governor of arkansas to be president how about jimmy carter a peanut farmer from rural georgia
9306707 this move the day after obamas greek temple speech has sucked the air out of obamas 15 minutes of fame i predict that obama will end up back in the senate humiliated by a devastating defeat
9306708 the vice president is a heartbeat away from becoming president so to choose someone with not one hours worth of experience on national issues is a dangerous choice
9306709 if john mccain thought that choosing sarah palin would attract hillary clinton voters he is badly mistaken
9306710 the only similarity between her and hillary clinton is that they are both women on the issues they could not be further apart
9306711 the welcoming committee is a criminal enterprise made up of 35 anarchists who are intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9306712 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers they have recruited assistance in their criminal conspiracy from other anarchists groups throughout the country
9306713 i think friday nights raid was a scare tactic to not go to the big demonstration monday
9306714 it was a tactic to try and take out the leaders

9306724 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9306725 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes
9306726 the interaction was very fruitful the human resource available in the region is of good quality as the interaction showed
9306727 the event witnessed excellent participation of students the gender mix of the participants was also positive

9306729 it would therefore be onerous and would also cause irreparable loss and injury to the petitioner if the respondents are permitted to retrospectively levy tax on sales of imported sugar between 1997 98 and 1999 2000 and recover the same from the petitioner
9306730 there is nothing like being present when history is being made
9306731 these talented performers will present shows which will become part of our regions musical lore for years to come
9306732 i hope i am being an example of the correct reason to do this
9306733 heath is an impressive young man he listens to what you tell and he tries to do it i have always told him you need to try to feel what the writer was writing its not all about doing it pretty its about conveying the message
9306734 well be doing everything from a little bluegrass sound to traditional southern gospel and even some original material written by emily
9306735 after 30 plus years devoting myself to my art and craft i needed to make a musical statement that someday i could look back on and realize at that moment of time i did exactly what i wanted to do ive never written songs like this i was on this inspirational roll there was an urgency to it i realized that i had no more time in my life for rehearsals and i took that energy into the studio
9306736 the guy had the keys to every studio in town
9306737 i wanted players who knew how to frame a song
9306738 who knew how to take a lyric and enhance it
9306739 when i went to the city we got a chance to hang out in those neighborhoods destroyed by the hurricane
9306740 i was shocked and embarrassed by the fact that two years later a major american city could be left in that state of chaos that really affected me people losing their city but not losing their heart
9306741 i did everything on blind faith and gut feeling but it worked like a charm
9306742 the project began to take on this incredible momentum there was a creative energy that carried the project through every musician dedicated themselves to these songs it was the most effortless joyful inspirational playing ive experienced since recording abandoned luncheonette there was a special chemistry a special moment in time
9306743 when we do come back together we bring those experiences to what we do which makes it even better but this is a very personal record for me and without a doubt the highlight of my recording career
9306744 our first day of spring football we were amazed at how many kids didnt even know how to get into a proper stance on some of the special teams particularly the punt team
9306745 then we had two guys who werent in their lanes heck we didnt have anybody inside the dang hashes
9306746 sometimes he was real late getting to his spot as a receiver
9306747 you could see him running around confused i think there was a lot of water moving around in his head
9306748 i was really watching the players and their body language
9306749 and how they were trying to play the game you could see they were really trying looking you in the eye they were encouraging each other things weve been stressing to be positive for team chemistry
9306750 i didnt think there was any negativity on the sideline
9306751 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9306752 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9306753 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end

9306768 we are not in condition to win premier league matches we have not got players in the right slots and senior players are not playing the way they should be
9306769 weve got a lot of young players in the side but its not those players who are letting us down
9306770 i dont think we have played well in any game so far although i thought we probably played better here than we did when we won at west brom and lost at home to blackburn
9306771 portsmouth defended well and took their chances we defended poorly and didnt take our chances
9306772 id been waiting for jermain defoe to come good him and peter crouch and it was nice to see them link up together
9306773 defoe scored a great goal hes got that ability and he also worked very hard for the team as well it was a great result for us
9306774 and david james is different class that was a world class save in the first half from mikel arteta to keep us 1 0 up and then to save the penalty from yakubu as well hes a fantastic goalkeeper
9306775 there have been plenty of highs and lows in my career and its been an honour to wear the springbok jersey but it is time to go
9306776 with the new laws and a new era in front of us with the way rugby is played and with a new coach peter de villiers it is the right time
9306777 i have had many memorable moments in a springbok jersey and it has been a privilege to play for my country and to go around the world playing against so many great players of other countries
9306778 i want to thank de villiers gary gold and dick muir the assistant boks coaches and the selectors for recalling me to the side after the world cup last year
9306779 this study adds to existing evidence supporting the hygiene hypothesis which states that early exposure to potential allergens results in a reduced risk of asthma development
9306780 ensure we have up to date figures that will help us better target the help we provide for veterans in prison
9306781 effectively when armed personnel return there is no help for them
9306782 contrasts greatly with the way the united states provide counselling and assistance to their armed personnel
9306783 i have come to the conclusion that if proper treatment was available for these disturbed servicemen hundreds if not thousands would not have offended
9306784 the government is letting them and their families down very badly indeed
9306785 as many as 8 500 former soldiers are currently in custody in the uk
9306786 there is no systematic availability of stress related counselling this should be made available without delay and would drastically reduce the number of receptions into custody
9306787 the mod works closely with the service charities to support veterans when they leave the armed forces and for those who find themselves in prison
9306788 the prison in reach initiative already provides advice on the support available to veterans before and after their release robust systems are in place to treat and prevent ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and other stress disorders
9306789 the game went by really fast i was just trying to soak all of it in
9306790 i was just anticipating this moment for so long coming out i had a few jitters because i really hadnt played in a while now ive got my first start under my belt and i can only get better
9306791 ive got to make plays out there thats the bottom line
9306792 hes the starter now and there was all this anticipation coming up to the first game and i think we all saw him come out in the second half and operate a little bit better play a little calmer
9306793 he needs to now move on and do that every game he needs to have confidence because hes capable of doing some really good things overall after he calmed down i thought he did a nice job
9306794 we were slow dry and boring in the first half
9306795 that wasnt the cougar offense youre used to putting the ball in the air making big plays
9306796 its been awhile since hes been in action and he hasnt had a lot of opportunities in his career hes got a long way to go yet we want him to continue to grow and develop i think hes well on his way to doing that
9306797 the thing about gary that i think will ultimately help him have a great year is that hes a great person number one
9306798 and hes got a great work ethic hes done an unbelievable job in the offseason preparing himself for this season
9306799 hes stayed committed to the program hes stayed loyal to the program youd love to see a success story there we all need it we all want it
9306800 i told them there was a better team in the locker room than we showed on the field
9306801 we do believe we can run the football we do believe we can pass the football we believe we can tackle better
9306802 theres no area we can feel comfortable about right now
9306803 i take him as being probably the best driver on the circuit you never know what he can come up with during a race or what him and crew chief chad knaus can come up with in their cars to make it fast
9306804 we talked about it this week my trainer and i we were kind of going over the guys that were really going to be tough and it goes without saying jimmie johnson has proven that he can do it when it matters i think thats one of the guys youre going to have to beat youre going to have to beat jimmie to be the champion
9306805 to me its about how disheartening it is for everybody in the organization the players coaches and front office to not see the excitement funnel its way into tropicana field
9306806 the tv ratings are high and thats a great sign but it hasnt translated to the number of people at tropicana field it really takes the wind out of our sails
9306807 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9306808 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9306809 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9306810 i dont think that we played what i consider well more than three series in a row on either side of the ball
9306811 that was a pretty sloppy game and offensively we were pretty sloppy
9306812 weve got a long ways to go and a lot of room to get better
9306813 go on in you have to go inside when you walk in that space you cant deny what happened to these people you can feel it touch it smell it
9306814 we want to transform the discussion about race and poverty in america
9306815 many many white people and black people of good will have been separated by ideological fights that have been powerful but you cant transform the discussion if you cant remember what happened
9306816 is black men not caring for their children today in any way connected to slavery these are the kinds of questions we should be asking i want to get beyond the moonlight and magnolia myths of the plantation

9306821 overripe fruit used in spreads will likely cause a runny final product

9306823 the owners of the plant considering the health happiness and prosperity of its employees is of as great importance in the final result as are the machines
9306824 in spinning his story to the chicago tribune mariotti depicted the sun times as the titanic and it was clear the self proclaimed tough guy was knocking over the old women and children to be the first to jump ship
9306825 we wish jay well and will miss him not personally of course but in the sense of noticing he is no longer here at least for a few days
9306826 what an ugly way to leave the sun times it does not speak well of you
9306827 they believe in our defense and thats half the battle if they believe in it theyll go out there and commit to it
9306828 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there certainly was a chance of a pga tour record tying 59
9306829 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure
9306830 its nonsense youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know
9306831 if this work was hard or overwhelming if she ever felt any loneliness in so often being the first you never wouldve known it
9306832 self pity was never an option as far as stephanie was concerned
9306833 it was a fun event but man it wasnt the outcome we were looking for and as a fishing guide it is pretty frustrating to go through all that and not catch fish
9306834 iaconelli is an intense fisherman and he got pretty grumpy when things werent working his way on the water
9306835 it definitely wasnt anything we did wrong it was just the elements worked against us
9306836 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9306837 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9306838 this storm could be as bad as it gets storm surge could be 15 to 20 feet worse than katrina
9306839 going some place you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9306840 but ive had over a week to think about it so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9306841 i would have loved it if we could have met in the final
9306842 my biggest worry is that shes so good sorry but im thinking about how im going to get past her
9306843 shes playing really well and im glad she feels like shes playing her best right now im not playing my best but that means i can do so much better
9306844 i have a very good feeling about the next round i saw serena play against her i dont know how to say her first name too well
9306845 and you know its great that its the u s open
9306846 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9306847 if anyone in the crew had any doubt about the foul call whatsoever we would have gone to the replay
9306848 we like each other we play really hard and were unselfish
9306849 with lindsay and asjha jones as our cornerstone we havent changed much in what we do offensively weve been able to jell quicker than i or most people thought and most people probably thought a year from now
9306850 in my experience with the awards and all of that stuff when your team does well and you win youll be awarded accordingly
9306851 in the wnba its hard because there are so many top players and what do you base it on team records individual stats thats why if my team wins the championship and i play a part in that whatever comes comes
9306852 it is getting a little frustrating at least we wound up winning the game so thats a positive
9306853 i dont know if you can assume a double play
9306854 unless you can see that it was done extremely obviously
9306855 i know we havent won many of the low scoring games
9306856 we got a good start six innings from fridays winner felix hernandez but he was still on the edge all night
9306857 the low scoring games are little more interesting because you can start thinking about the next couple of days
9306858 otherwise you worry about the next few because you dont have a lot of arms left
9306859 if they look at it and its not a home run it will be up to the discretion of the umpires to determine where the runners should be
9306860 its not like a ground rule double does a runner stay at third
9306861 i dont have a problem with it but i hope it doesnt expand to other areas
9306862 a short strike will be relatively inconsequential by the time we get to 2009 well forget about it
9306863 a longer strike will have more material consequences particularly for the 787 and it will make boeing continue to think about alternatives to the seattle work force
9306864 suppliers will have to cut back to match boeings requirements
9306865 we can sustain people help each other through these strikes we will make it
9306866 in the long run it makes washington state a bit less competitive
9306867 the only parts of the country where aerospace is growing are right to work states down south
9306868 we wouldnt be saying job security is a top issue if we didnt think they already had plans for doing that
9306869 when we negotiate with a company we do take into consideration whether the company will be able to financially to support the recall in some cases it doesnt work out that way
9306870 dari ketiga opsi itu yang dipilih adalah non listed company karena tidak terganggu turun naiknya kondisi pasar modal
9306871 all that the governments have been doing both in the state and at the centre is paint an illusion beautiful but hollow words is all they have to offer its been eight days and the violence continues if such a situation persists we will have no option but to form our own suraksha vahini
9306872 we met the prime minister the home minister and will meet the president tomorrow however i have my doubts that anything fruitful will come out of it all that we keep getting are fine words that this will be done and that will be done in reality not only kandhamal but many districts in orissa are burning
9306873 i have told people from orissa to say they are not christians in order to save their lives you can follow religion as long as you are alive this sadly is increasingly becoming an intolerant society
9306874 the state government says peace is being restored and people are returning to their homes which homes are they talking about the ones that have been burnt down
9306875 personally im always ready to learn although i dont always like being taught
9306876 where else do you have such an abundance of land
9306877 so what happens if you see two guys put weapons into the trunk of a car
9306878 there might be a chance we survive eight years of bush i dont know thats where the hope comes in
9306879 vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations
9306880 enthusiasm is why bush won the 2004 election over john kerry it allowed him to maximize republican turnout in ohio and other key states
9306881 i just hope he can get the help that he needs
9306882 do not press the alarm give me all the large bills in your drawer i have a gun i do not want to hurt anyone no dye no bait money you have 10 seconds
9306883 they think its odd but everyone just accepts it now
9306884 i the prime minister have come to office in the appropriate way and i wont resign
9306885 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over we would have a serious problem if we took it to parliament right now
9306886 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9306887 they are avoiding the issue they dont want a status of forces agreement they dont want a security agreement
9306888 today is a kind of epiphany because we might have a solution for at least one state
9306889 i believe the 2001 roadless rule to be one of the most effective conservation measures of our time however conservation cannot endure if the people most affected by it dont support it
9306890 we are proud of the way we manage our own state lands and our own private lands
9306891 they own two out of every three acres in idaho
9306892 if you look at the substance its frankly not hugely different from the clinton rule of 2001 what is different is the messenger
9306893 think of it as a dinner party thrown by revolutionaries
9306894 theres a cleanliness to the meat when you take the time to do things right you are rewarded
9306895 this is a very grass roots effort that connects young artists environmentalists and young people all of whom are engaged for their own reason
9306896 we have to meet each other and understand our power as a group
9306897 all of this in a country that invented fast food and the supermarket
9306898 an important moment because we officially change our rhythm and enter a new cycle
9306899 share tasks to best organize the daily life of children
9306900 high priced gasoline is here to stay i tell my people we are just at the beginning of a very big cycling boom
9306901 in the united states we simply have not figured out how to fit the pieces together for a coordinated package that puts people on bikes
9306902 with a car you cant reliably predict how long your commute will be but you can with a bike
9306903 you are not affected by traffic jams you can just ride through them its a real advantage
9306904 the manners of tokyo cyclists are very poor and sometime suicidal
9306905 negative thinking about bicycles we are far behind our counterparts in europe
9306906 steven j sasson an electrical engineer created the first digital camera
9306907 my prototype was big as a toaster but the technical people loved it

9306909 i remember wandering through the labs in 2003 and seeing the theoretical model that could become stream
9306910 the technology was half baked but it was a real breakthrough
9306911 ive been here five years and im still learning about all the things they already have
9306912 it seems kodak had developed antibodies against anything that might compete with film
9306913 allan camp a technician at kodaks inkjet development center in rochester works on the development of print heads for printers
9306914 these are the best games to play in without doubt
9306915 its the first one of the season and its a chance to see what each other is like so we will be looking to get three points as will rangers
9306916 if we look at that aspect of the league last season it was fairly even
9306917 both teams will have to try to turn that on its head this year
9306918 any time you go to celtic park you expect an extremely difficult game and we will get that
9306919 i dont think you can draw any great conclusions other than you get a great psychological lift if you can manage to get a good result at either ground
9306920 to p j macklin from united airlines my 22 year old son is being deployed to iraq as an army reservist i needed to be strong and supportive until i had to kiss him and hug him as i sent him through the security lines to board his airplane but i was dreading it all the same as we start moving to take our place in the line we hear hey soldier come over here it was a united ticket agent it was apparent my son was heading off to somewhere no parent wants their child to go he gave us a pass to go to the gate to see him off he said he too wished my son did not have to go and understood my tears and that there was no need for thanks so on a day i consider to be one of the worst days of my life this gentleman found a way to make our experience better and he did it out of the kindness of his heart
9306921 to the totally naked slightly painted group of 20 men and women cyclists on the burke gilman trail near u village on aug 17 you all seemed to be enjoying yourselves but it was a disgusting display that i and the families using the trail could live without
9306922 to the male seahawks fan who assisted me by returning to the mens restroom to make sure that my friend who is disabled by cancer and uses a wheelchair was able to use the facilities safely he offered to wait for him inside just knowing by the look on my face that i was concerned blessings to you for doing a good deed during a good game
9306923 to the seattle department of transportation for restriping yesler street so the bike lane jumps back and forth from one side of the road to the other the center line also swings left and right by several feet i have seen several near collisions as drivers cross an intersection at the crest of a hill only to discover that the center line on the opposite side of the intersection has jumped several feet sideways leaving them about to have a head on collision with an oncoming car it is only a matter of time before someone is killed or seriously injured by this crazy design the slalom is an entertaining event in the winter olympics but it is not a smart way to stripe a road or a bike lane
9306924 fighting traffic the dawn of the motor age in the american city
9306925 we dont have white sox or red sox we have the united sox of america
9306926 theyre following their queen these bees moved with an old queen
9306927 the new queen emerges in the hive after the old queen leaves but if not they will fight for dominance
9306928 the queen will mate once in her lifetime and then lays up to 1 000 eggs a day all of her life for years what we dont know is is it fun
9306929 when shes not laying well the worker bees will make a new queen from her eggs other bees are fed a little royal jelly honey and pollen queens are made with only royal jelly

9306934 in the past people would laugh and enjoy flying but 9 11 changed a tremendous amount of things
9306935 its not as fun now as it used to be
9306936 the first gentleman i put down a paper mat for stared at it and then rolled his eyes
9306937 the look on his face told me this needs a crayon so the next week i came back with crayons the passengers laughed and started drawing right away
9306938 ive traveled all over the world and never had an experience quite like that one
9306939 when she handed us the crayons we were kind of all looking at each other she sort of in a teasing manner goaded us into participating it only took 10 minutes before we were all drawing and we were busy until the descent into salt lake city the time went by so fast it seemed we had just taken off it was a good experience
9306940 and think what is it i can possibly do where is life going to take me we werent looking at a spectacular lake we grew up looking at the blackberry bushes and garbage in the lot across the street you had to have a big imagination

9307104 i wished to bring back to vivid reality the many tragic experiences of men who wasted their best years fighting a war against their wills if only because cooperation with the war effort was the only way in which to live out the chaotic period
9307105 he cannot escape the brand of oppressor without himself becoming one of the oppressed
9307106 one of the most trenchant social critics in the japanese cinema
9307107 my position has always been exceptions of rape incest and the life of the mother
9307108 we were told early on that the platform is going to be pro life and that any differences the senator has with it are his own
9307109 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed it only energized our grass roots
9307110 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9307111 would we take her to alaska fishing one last time
9307112 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
9307113 the two worked together for barely a week after which mccain accused obama of partisan posturing
9307114 she possesses every single quality i have if i can do it she can
9307115 someone took a chance on me back in the day all she needs is someone to take a chance on her simple as that
9307116 all the qualities are there for people to evaluate against other candidates thats the real issue it has nothing to do with being the first woman its her versus the field at that moment in time
9307117 she had more responsibility than probably anyone on the staff
9307118 she traveled with the club evaluated minor league players prepared arbitration cases she had a ton of responsibilities
9307119 it wasnt a tryout or a situation where i hired her because of her gender or ethnicity i had worked with her and knew she was the right person for the job she has all the credibility in the world
9307120 ill tell you point blank theres no debating her ability if anyone thinks she was hired for any position because of her gender they havent interacted with her or worked against her then you know that gender had nothing to do with it it was ability
9307121 most of my scenes in mukhbiir were with sammir when we started working together i didnt even know who he was he came across as very non filmy later i came to know he was from a business family with no bollywood connections
9307122 im very surprised by sammirs performance i think he has the potential to become a big star i told him if he was part of a film family like ranbir kapoor hed have been launched in style and become a star overnight though ranbirs debut flopped hes being written about everywhere and abhishek bachchan had 17 flops and he still got chance after chance
9307123 i at least got the support of offbeat filmmakers like shyam benegal and govind nihalani for a mainstream commercial actor today the competition is with the star sons who are launched in big lavish films who will take the same risk with an actor who isnt connected to the industry
9307124 because sammir is from outside the film industry he will have to work twice as hard to prove himself but mukhbiir would do it for sammir its a very unusual spy thriller and sammirs sensitive face leaves a lasting impact
9307125 we havent had great rhythm in practice on offense so i kind of knew we werent going to be able to do it in the game
9307126 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9307127 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9307128 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9307129 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9307130 you can just sense that if you give him time back there hes going to find guys and hes got a real attitude about him to take advantage of it
9307131 the only way to bounce back from a game like this is to take it as a learning experience
9307132 we will have a lot of work to do in practice
9307133 we wanted to come out start fast and get the connection going
9307134 we were productive and thats all that matters in the first game
9307135 were going to have to do a better job next week
9307136 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9307137 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9307138 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9307139 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9307140 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9307141 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9307142 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9307143 i can only say it so many times its not a big deal to me
9307144 as much as you can expect in an opening game like this
9307145 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9307146 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9307147 you feel for anyone who goes down especially when it looks like a leg injury
9307148 first you think oh is it a knee then is it an ankle from what i gather other than getting medical people into it its a foot thing x rays are negative but absolutely your heart jumps
9307149 all we know is they must have missed their jump site
9307150 naar het schijnt hebben varanen een voorliefde voor vrouwelijke filmregisseurs in spe en jonge ingenieurs
9307151 um reconhecimento que se soma a meus outros t tulos mas n o me deixo embriagar pela vaidade
9307152 minha m e conta que o meu interesse pela ci ncia surgiu desde cedo
9307153 temos um problema cr nico de falta de cultura cient fica
9307154 a ci ncia est sendo ensinada por indiv duos desinteressados e desapaixonados sem paix o n o h ensino de qualidade
9307155 having a brain but no education is like owning and valuing a nice pair of shoes when you live in the forest you put them on and they look and feel nice but when you want to leave you have to take them off again because the bush and thorns will destroy them and they wont be nice anymore they will destroy your feet too so you dont go anywhere instead you walk around the house in your nice shoes but never leave home no one knows you or that you have nice shoes that is why everyone must go to school they must recognize their brain learn to use it subject it to the harshness of the forest and share their knowledge with others
9307156 run of the mill with a dull script and an assortment of predictable characters
9307157 if the show survives until next semester itll be surprising
9307158 a range of measures that will have a significant impact on patient services
9307159 i find it very alarming that these cuts are going to directly affect patient care
9307160 there are also short sighted cuts such as health promotion and cuts in home care packages which will put people back in the hospital system
9307161 the hses financial regime is underpinned by strict controls accountability service targets and value for money requirements
9307162 in nigeria ramadan is a festive occasion tv channels show ramadan programs radio stations play quran recitations everyone knows it is ramadan
9307163 the environment here is like any other day so it doesnt seem much like ramadan
9307164 the mps can see the trend among the people who are demanding change
9307165 thats why they are keen to support a party that is fair to all races
9307166 what separates poetry from religious dogma is the ability of a poem to speak across time to everyone no matter their world view
9307167 not only are the unite leaders trying to deny me the right to speak now they are also trying to take away my democratic right to protest
9307168 the truth about what happened in our dispute is part of the history of the labour movement and as such is the property of the whole movement it is not mine to sell
9307169 this just shows the lengths that the unite leadership are prepared to go to keep me silent tony woodley and jimmy kelly are so determined to shut me up they are prepared to put me in jail rather than allow me to protest outside an empty building
9307170 it is a scandal that trade union leaders should use the courts to prevent a peaceful protest they are setting a dangerous precedent that will be taken up by employers and by the government to prevent pickets and protests by trade union members or by communities
9307171 if tony woodley and jimmy kelly think that by approaching me with a bribe in one hand and a court order in the other they will shut me up they can think again i am appealing to all trade unionists to stand with me to defend the basic freedoms of speech and association
9307172 the true measure of education is not what you know but how you decide to share what you know with others
9307173 theres the potential for a rally after labor day but we also have a potential hurricane coming into play
9307174 but were also in an election cycle were the republicans want to reduce the bad news
9307175 so if they dont have to take action until after the convention or the elections they wont
9307176 the opening of the rafah crossing was a chance to let out steam between hamas and egypt which continues its regular contacts with hamas in gaza and abroad in syria on the issue of gilad shalit
9307177 that stephen carter mr browns high profile strategist is to leave his job after a bitter turf war inside downing street the public relations gurus move to a lower key role is a victory for the prime ministers long serving advisers
9307178 he just wants short term headlines of him getting on with the job doing the job being the man for the job the job in hand
9307179 some idiot in the pinko commie tax leech business group at the expense of
9307180 reached across party lines to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands of terrorists
9307181 some idiot in the pinko commie tax leech business group at the expense of
9307182 i was just thinking hurricane gustav is proof that there is a god in heaven
9307183 to have it planned at the same time that it would actually hit new orleans on day one of the republican convention up in the twin cities at the top of the mississippi river
9307184 southern decadence a celebration of gay life perversion amp evil
9307185 and we havent seen the full bore of the housing crisis
9307186 financial stress job layoffs housing problems transportation all of which can complicate and heighten an already existing diagnosis of depression or anxiety
9307187 the standard percentage paid by the insurance company used to be 80 20
9307188 whose family is under such financial stress that she cant come anymore which is horrible ill reduce my fee but its the gas to get here theyre going down to one car and they cant spare the car
9307189 families where the main breadwinner is in the mortgage and housing industry are just being killed by this
9307190 someone who could come alongside them and give them guidance and emotional confidence
9307191 i try to help clients focus on what they have control over
9307192 maybe a mechanic friend helps you with your car and you pay them back by fixing their computer
9307193 we dont have a whole lot of control over this economy but i want to help clients see what they do have control over
9307194 this has quietly and insidiously grown into a big problem
9307195 its not a creepy guy in an overcoat pushing drugs this is about medications that are in your home
9307196 you can get addicted any time but the two most vulnerable times are adolescence and old age
9307197 they tend to forget the pills are in there or they feel they paid for them and dont want to toss them
9307198 preventing substance abuse among teens is primarily a mom and pop operation
9307199 i learned about the companies that run this business and politics leverage and power it was interesting to see how a group of lawyers treated the likes of carlton cuse lost and marc cherry desperate housewives and neal baer law amp order svu and carol mendelsohn csi crime scene investigation and people who have created properties that have made those companies so much money i didnt think it was right
9307200 i think i learned more about myself in that stretch of time than i did in the previous five or six years because life had gone very well for me up until that point
9307201 it was a real test are you prepared to lose something for the right cause essentially in my mind it became a question of can i show the same kind of resolve that i would demand from a character that i was writing ultimately i decided that it wasnt that big of a tragedy in the grand scheme of things that i didnt get to go to the shield for the finale i come from a place rockford ill where people do a lot tougher things than that it seems like a silly thing to whine about
9307202 we still finished it the way we set out to but what was missing was the familial aspect we werent together to do it and that was disappointing because weve been such a great team
9307203 as a writer your job is to explore the moral issues that interest you the most you cant be principled without really thinking about whats right and wrong and i think clearly shawn has done that shawn was always fascinated with the moral ambiguities of characters and i think the psychopathology of vic mackey makes him one of the greatest characters thats been written for television
9307204 if you look at march 2002 there were a couple of exciting things on tv that premiered that year 24 and alias
9307205 but a lot of tv was getting very stagnant so there was an appetite for this kind of stuff those gates were ready to open whether it was us or somebody else
9307206 i like songs that have a strong ending and books that have the confidence to end and say this or that
9307207 it brought people into town by the carload the vanload even by the busload
9307208 but theres no reason to be no reason at all
9307209 today is also a day of mourning for the ingle family to whom we send our sincerest thoughts and prayers
9307210 they laid to rest a son brother and husband and our hearts go out to them as we are certain they are suffering unimaginable pain
9307211 you cant feel the pleasure of the treasure without pressure
9307212 katanya mungkin karena itulah ia sempat berfikir enak juga kalau bisa tinggal di batam tapi dengan penghasilan dollar seperti yang diperolehnya sekarang

9307259 there is no technical reason that a third party could not accumulate and assemble the hardware components in an apple labeled computer hardware system such that said system would be capable of running the mac os
9307260 the kernel panic is self induced by apples embedding of code to prevent operability on computer hardware systems that are not apple labeled computer hardware systems
9307261 the mac os market is distinct and unique as compared to other operating systems including but not limited to the windows operating system
9307262 as such psystar alleges that the windows operating system is not and cannot be considered an effective substitute for the mac os the same holds true for any other operating system
9307263 apple is free to control and charge customers supra competitive prices
9307264 apple has at the least substantially lessened competition in the mac os capable computer hardware systems marketplace if not eliminated it in its entirety and as a result maintains its monopoly position with respect to the mac os and the artificially created apple labeled computer hardware system

9307273 as a precaution for our patients visitors and employees access to the entire hospital campus initially was restricted
9307274 will remain closed until the nature and extent of the exposure is determined
9307275 fifteen employees and one patient had to be decontaminated as a precaution but we dont believe that anybody else has been harmed
9307276 the very concept of this murder horrifies all decent people
9307277 to kidnap a man to leave a little boy standing there in the street to cart him about the country and then that long walk up the beach chills the blood how anyone could be so cruel and heartless as you it is impossible to understand
9307278 was going to be as likely as not his last
9307279 as callously cruel and chilling and calculated as one can imagine
9307280 i had just seen a man killed a man i had been talking to for a good period of that day saying it was going to be ok
9307281 i believe their motive was robbery and as it went along their fantasies took over individually they are violent men in their own right but put them together and they are a cocktail for disaster
9307282 imagine two young blokes macho men physically geeing each other and they did fantasise an awful lot they fancied themselves as being good criminals or hot shots in the army
9307283 the object of kidnapping mr price was robbery but as it went on their fantasies took over and he paid the ultimate sacrifice of their fantasy

9307288 paul hartley and i enjoyed some good tussles in midfield in the edinburgh derby
9307289 but the glasgow derby is very different the pace is much quicker the players are better there are more fans and obviously theres more pressure on you to win
9307290 i go out and give 100 for the team i think about the game who were playing against how we are going to play and its always the same
9307291 if you prepared differently for facing rangers i dont think youre going to play as well against st mirren hibs hearts or whoever we come up against

9307452 its better and its better because hes probably more comfortable were probably nitpicking here a bit but the strength of hitters is different here in the majors weve noticed a few times when the ball was hit i think its surprised him but hes been pretty good in center field being aggressive and taking charge hes laid out a few times

9307473 any player coming to spurs whether hes a big signing or just a ground staff boy must be dedicated to the game and to the club he must never be satisfied with his last performance and he must hate losing

9307518 el inss es un elefante blanco la cobertura del cien por ciento de los medicamentos debe ser una disposici n que tienen que hacer cumplir y no quedar s lo en los discursos las previsionales tendr an que cubrir todos los tratamientos
9307519 no es posible que un gobierno porque se le antoja cierre las previsionales deben corregir lo malo que se est haciendo para el bien de los asegurados o tener sus propias cl nicas y hospitales
9307520 con ese dinero deber a construir su propio hospital para atender mejor a los asegurados ellos deber an asegurarse de que se ofrezca mayor calidad no pueden permitir que se extienda a cuatro meses la programaci n de una operaci n
9307521 no me gustar a ser atendida en un hospital p blico se llenan demasiado y si estoy pagando es para recibir una atenci n diferenciada aqu la atenci n es buena me siento bien en esta cl nica
9307522 es cuando te dicen que algunos medicamentos no te los cubre el seguro y hay meses en que uno no viene del todo a atenderse
9307523 cuando ten s una emergencia hay cosas que no las cubre el seguro deber an acabar con eso si de verdad el inss est pensando en el asegurado

9307527 no estoy de acuerdo de todas formas aqu todo lo hacen sin tomarlo en cuenta a uno como asegurado la opini n de nosotros no es tomada en cuenta si no fuera por la ley yo simplemente dir a que no me quiten nada
9307528 esas cl nicas las est n cerrando por alguna raz n esa es una de las luchas que tenemos que queden nicamente las cl nicas que tienen condiciones para ofrecer atenci n a los asegurados y jubilados que queden cl nicas que nos ofrezcan toda la cobertura en salud tanto las emergencias y las consultas de especializaci n

9307612 john mccain issued one statement that was definitive clear and reflected the reality of the situation
9307613 in contrast barack obama issued three or four statements steadily evolving over several days essentially into sen mccains position
9307614 this was a snapshot of the value of having experienced wisdom and judgment on these matters
9307615 mccain was able to articulate what he believes in a crisp decisive manner
9307616 in contrast it was one of those instances where you dont see barack obama with a teleprompter hes kind of stammering wandering halting hes asked basic questions like why do you want to be president when does life begin and he gives fairly unconvincing fairly unclear answers
9307617 mccain has an extraordinary compelling story of accomplishment and service and putting country first even if it meant great peril for him physically politically or otherwise
9307618 obamas resume is quite thin at least for the purpose of someone who wants to be president of the united states
9307619 barack obama has not led the country on an issue of national significance in a way that has cost him anything politically he always toes the partisan line
9307620 everybodys for that that wasnt some act of courage to take on his party

9307628 we used to cut down many trees for agricultural use which brought us a lot of hardship including windstorms decreased rainfall and increased solar intensity
9307629 the amount of rainfall has dramatically increased in the last five years and heat from the sun has reduced and we now have better yield
9307630 serious concern for future economic development and sustained rural livelihoods
9307631 we were doing everything by ourselves but we realised that we were not achieving much and we now involve local communities around the forests without whose help we would fail in our conservation efforts
9307632 kakum is one of the last vestiges of the upper guinea forest and one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world
9307633 the government now devolves more power to the forest communities in conserving the forests and shares the revenues coming from the forests and the results are quite remarkable

9307659 lo que ocurri es que se cruz la informaci n entre el nter de que nosotros despachamos la informaci n y ellos la asf enviaron una comunicaci n al gobernador record ndole la situaci n
9307660 la verdad no s de d nde obtuvieron esa informaci n pero quien la haya prove do tan aventuradamente al decir que el estado desvi se me hace que es irresponsable es estar abonando al desprestigio de nuestro gobierno que francamente amerita ser reconocido en sus aciertos aunque se se alen errores
9307661 en cualquier tiempo que los recursos del instituto no bastaran para cubrir con las obligaciones a su cargo establecidas por esta ley el d ficit que hubiere ser cubierto por el estado y organismos incorporados en la proporci n a que a cada un corresponde
9307662 est previsto que los recursos del pafef son para fortalecimiento de estados est previsto que se destinen cantidades de esos recursos precisamente para sanear o proveer la cuesti n de las pensiones para los trabajadores del estado
9307663 se agarr esa lana y se le puso al instituto no hay ning n desv o sino por el contrario creo que el estado est respondiendo a una obligaci n que tiene de darle prevenci n social a los trabajadores del estado aunque stas como ya sabemos sean superiores a las proyecciones que tienen los trabajadores

9307666 a toro pasado aqu lo que hacemos es verificar muy estrechamente las obras durante su ejecuci n antes en la licitaci n y luego al t rmino eso es transparentar y fiscalizar

9307684 clare this man is my best friend and weather youre here or not i will tell him how we got here
9307685 well i invited her back to my home and i expected and she expected a one night stand type of thing a week later in a bar we ran into eachother and it happened again a week later in a another club the same thing but this time her house and i didnt leave i asked her to dinner and we dated for a little while before we had sex again but when we did i told her what i was and she got the biggest smile i had ever seen and hugged me she told me how she always had this vampire obsession and she wanted to be one so a few days later after she thought about it some more during sex i turned her 2 years later we got married
9307686 destiny just told me when she was little she said she was going to be a vampire
9307687 she is so pretty and why did lee look at you and me like that
9307688 she is and he was just trying to fighure out if there was something between us

9307692 nuestra exigencia primordial es la soluci n definitiva al problema que aqueja a issstecali en cuanto a los servicios m dicos y medicamentos as como el correcto pago de nuestra prima de antig edad que desde 1989 no se ha pagado correctamente
9307693 estamos en la lucha esperando que se resuelva correctamente el secretario de la secci n 37 ya ha tomado cartas en el asunto
9307694 las entidades federativas en particular baja california tienen ya serios conflictos con las instituciones de seguridad social que como el issstecali generan gastos al estado son problemas que tienen que ver con las pensiones especialmente para con los maestros que deber n encontrar una soluci n similar a la encontrada por la universidad
9307695 por qu lo permiten por qu no obligan a que les paguen si no lo hacen esto va a repercutir en contra de los derechohabientes

9307744 the west took russia in as a member of the g8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9307745 these nations should meet in the old g7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the united nations
9307746 the signs point to the eu trying to cooperate more with russia rather than less

9307748 only dreamers can run after the notion of a western europe independent of russian oil and gas

9307754 its a wild gamble undertaken by our oldest ever first time candidate for president in hopes of changing the board of this election campaign maybe it will work but maybe and at least as likely it will reinforce a theme that id be pounding home if i were the obama campaign that its john mccain for all his white hair who represents the risky choice while it is barack obama who offers cautious steady predictable governance
9307755 i think this is the biggest political gamble just about in all of american history

9307775 we have imposed curfew to stop people from assembling and taking part in the major rally in view of intelligence reports of presence of some militants in jammu
9307776 we had urged sangarsh samiti to postpone the rally he said adding that they told us they will go ahead with the rally
9307777 there is a security concern and that is why curfew was the only alternative

9307853 un cristiano ovunque si trovi ha la possibilit di vivere la sua fede anche nei luoghi e nelle condizioni pi difficili una testimonianza cristiana dunque tendenzialmente possibile anche in una terra di frontiera come larabia dove ci sono evidenti e storiche diversit sociali culturali e religiose lo stesso vale per il servizio di un vescovo
9307854 quasi a ridosso precisa di una delle pi grandi moschee del paese tanto che posso quasi toccarla dal mio ufficio
9307855 evidentemente dobbiamo adattarci un po alla situazione di una terra musulmana dove sottolinea il presule non abbiamo le stesse condizioni e possibilit che si avrebbero forse in altri paesi per guardando i nostri fedeli devo ammettere di non aver limpressione che loro credano di meno di altri che hanno pi libert di azione anzi ho limpressione forse che contesti particolari in cui sono pi difficili lespressione e la testimonianza di fede costituiscano un arricchimento
9307856 la reciprocit come la sentiamo noi ordinariamente in europa non esiste a causa delle ragioni cui ho accennato cio le profonde diversit nella dimensione storica sociale culturale e religiosa certo evidenzia il presule sono favorevole allesigenza di una reciprocit soltanto devo ammettere guardando lattuale situazione che occorre pi tempo e talvolta anche maggiore pazienza se non addirittura la ricerca di altre modalit di rapporto
9307857 tendenza allarroganza che abbiamo nella nostra cultura non soltanto riguardo allislam abbiamo la tendenza a considerarci la vetta dello sviluppo dellumanit ma questo non giusto spiega perch non tutti i popoli sono costretti ad avere la stessa storia
9307858 anchio sono convinto che il mondo musulmano debba aprirsi di pi alla ragione secondo un processo che abbiamo attraversato anche noi per non detto che questo debba condurli allo stesso secolarismo
9307859 dobbiamo essere onesti e rispettosi ma che insistere sulle reciprocit in senso matematico non funziona
9307860 innanzitutto il concetto di democrazia secondo la mentalit occidentale osserva il risultato di un lungo processo che anche la chiesa ha fatto fatica ad accettare non si possono imporre democrazia e diritti come li conosciamo noi perch sono frutto di un percorso che non detto sia quello che devono fare anche gli emirati arabi
9307861 incrementare il dialogo con le autorit spiegando loro la situazione concreta in cui vivono i fedeli cristiani soprattutto i pi emarginati coloro che hanno difficolt ad accedere ai nostri centri coloro che soffrono gravi difficolt economiche si tratta di ravvivare il processo di dialogo attraverso una rinegoziazione questo non esclude che anche fuori dalla penisola araba ci si impegni a ricordare a questi governi di ascoltare la loro gente di concedere ai cristiani maggiore libert di azione nei vari ambiti della vita quotidiana
9307862 la situazione dice monsignor hinder molto diversificata nel vicariato apostolico di arabia sebbene in quasi tutti i paesi esista la libert di culto tranne che in arabia saudita che lunico a non avere un luogo in cui i cattolici oltre 800 000 possano riunirsi per pregare lo fanno in case private spesso situate in luoghi periferici il re dellarabia saudita abdallah infatti non vieta la preghiera in luoghi privati purch non si rechi disturbo in ogni parrocchia vi una cappella dedicata alla madonna dove pregano anche i musulmani le chiese non hanno segni esterni o simboli visibili come croci o campanili
9307863 ci sono gruppi movimenti e associazioni che continuano il loro straordinario lavoro anche se in qualche circostanza dobbiamo stare attenti e offrire loro il nostro consiglio perch rimangano nellalveo della visione e del magistero della chiesa cattolica
9307864 nonostante ci dalle nostre parti afferma monsignor hinder la gente molto pia con un impegno profondo e una fede che veramente mi stupisce in molte circostanze

9307870 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9307871 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9307872 the west took russia in as a member of the g8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9307873 thus these nations should meet in the old g7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the united nations
9307874 according to these agreements the russians had certain rights on georgian territory
9307875 now the russians have no rights whatsoever on georgian territory their presence here is illegal and they should leave georgia
9307876 seven years ago we introduced at doha what was to be a
9307877 president kennedy who introduced the tokyo round famously said this will lift all boats and help developing countries like japan case made i would have thought
9307878 africa critically needs to realise development and get itself out of poverty through the establishment of fair trade rather than aid
9307879 the aggressive push by the rich countries led by the u s and the eu for more trade liberalisation at a time of global crises of food and fuel became too blatant for developing countries to stomach
9307880 this ensured a sales outlet the lack of which is often one of the biggest weaknesses of agriculture development projects
9307881 the timing of the accra aid meeting is important in the post doha debacle
9307882 there is going to be now a phase of consolidation and particularly a phase of bilateral negotiations which are very divisive and time consuming for african countries everybody trying to look after their own interests
9307883 development aid should not be measured by the amount sent but by how it transforms the life of the poor
9307884 the most important thing is that they are working for themselves
9307885 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
9307886 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
9307887 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9307888 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9307889 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
9307890 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
9307891 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
9307892 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
9307893 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
9307894 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
9307895 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
9307896 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
9307897 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
9307898 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
9307899 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
9307900 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
9307901 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
9307902 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
9307903 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
9307904 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
9307905 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
9307906 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
9307907 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
9307908 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9307909 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9307910 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
9307911 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
9307912 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
9307913 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
9307914 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
9307915 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
9307916 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
9307917 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
9307918 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
9307919 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
9307920 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
9307921 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
9307922 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
9307923 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

9307942 metteva laccento sulla necessit di una diversa professionalit del pm in relazione alle specificit delle funzioni requirenti rispetto alle giudicanti dunque diversa doveva essere la formazione la regolamentazione lorganizzazione degli uffici la stessa carriera essendo necessariamente diverse rispetto al giudice le attitudini labitus mentale lattivit investigativa del pm
9307943 il punto fondamentale avere un pm autonomo e indipendente ma anche efficiente il pm deve avere una regolamentazione ordinamentale diversa rispetto a quella del giudice non necessariamente separata questo non per assoggettare il pm allesecutivo come si afferma ma al contrario per esaltarne lindipendenza e lautonomia
9307944 bisognava creare le condizioni affinch acquistasse effettivit lesercizio dellazione penale
9307945 nessuno pensi al governo o in parlamento di sfruttare la vicenda per accelerare lapprovazione di un ddl incompatibile con il diritto dovere dei giornalisti di informare e con il diritto dei cittadini a conoscere fatti di rilevanza pubblica
9307946 bisogna trovare una soluzione condivisa per dire basta alluso indiscriminato delle intercettazioni
9307947 e innegabile leccesso e labuso di intercettazioni in italia cosi come innegabile che serva una riforma che auspichiamo sia rapida e condivisa dal partito democratico
9307948 per un popolo civile non vi nulla di pi vergognoso che lasciarsi governare senza opporre resistenza da una cricca di capi privi di scrupoli e dominati da torbidi istinti
9307949 non provocate la reazione popolare nella piana di gioia tauro
9307950 bisogna avere il coraggio e lonest la politica deve essere fatta con le mani pulite
9307951 what shall we call this one lionel mary no no gustav
9307952 sono cos triste che ho bisogno di stare da sola
9307953 perch solo il tempo capace di comprendere quanto lamore sia importante nella vita
9307954 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
9307955 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
9307956 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
9307957 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
9307958 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
9307959 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
9307960 legislative accomplishments are few and far between because he cannot work well and bring people together and persuade them of a positive issue
9307961 its a lot closer to a revolution than to a routine day at the office
9307962 the republicans are about to nominate the only person in our party distinct enough from the rest to have a chance of winning in what ought to be a very bad year he is our most different candidate since teddy roosevelt
9307963 the overwhelming evidence that climate change is taking place argues that we address the issue
9307964 really focuses on government spending it would be a radical change for washington d c
9307965 hes taking sides in an internal republican fight between the appropriators who always want to spend more and the rest of the party i think he can win it because despite the cacophony of special interest protests hell have popular support
9307966 if you are stubborn enough if you are not taking this as seriously as we need you to take it and if you decide to stay you are on your own
9307967 anyone who decides to stay ill say it like i said it before katrina make sure you have an axe because you will be carving your way or busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that you will be surrounded with in this event
9307968 the failure of the federal levees after hurricane katrina meant that we experienced devastation that we shouldnt have experienced
9307969 we dont know frankly we dont have a lot of faith in the work thats been done to repair the damage that was caused by those failures and by the storm so this time were feeling very insecure
9307970 i think that may be a bit of an exaggeration i mean they already had hurricane katrina and right now this is no hurricane katrina but we still think it will be a large and powerful hurricane and a significant threat
9307971 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9307972 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9307973 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9307974 more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9307975 the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9307976 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9307977 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9307978 there is no point in isolating russia but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9307979 i was really really confident before the penultimate stage that we were going to win this rally but what can you do
9307980 we just had a puncture and now were third i know we can win rallies and this season is not over yet so well just go flat out in the next rallies
9307981 nicht auf k rperwahrnehmung und k rperbewusstsein zielt sondern auf leistungsgerechtes funktionieren
9307982 die feministische diskussion hat dazu gef hrt dass man die jungen so behandelt wie man sie gern h tte und nicht wie sie sind
9307983 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
9307984 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
9307985 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

9308008 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
9308009 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
9308010 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
9308011 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

9308041 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
9308042 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
9308043 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
9308044 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
9308045 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
9308046 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

9308080 the counsellor gave me a list of different demons demon of anger demon of unforgiveness demon of pride there were lots of them and i was told to go away and circle the demons i had in me or around me
9308081 it was the counsellors and myself and they put their hands on me and started praying one by one for each of the demons that were on the list to be cast out of me
9308082 after each demon was cast out i had to say i confirm the demon of x has been cast out of me in the name of jesus and is unwelcome to return
9308083 the whole time i was there all i heard was that im demonic
9308084 even after the exorcism when i had the next anxiety attack i was told that they had already cast the demons out so therefore i was obviously either faking it or i had chosen to let the demons come back in which case i was not serious about getting better

9308155 all my life ive been incapable even of picturing any other love and ive reached the point now of sometimes thinking that love consists precisely in the right voluntarily granted by the beloved object to be tyrannized over in my underground dreams as well i never pictured love to myself otherwise than as a struggle for me it always started from hatred and ended with moral subjugation and afterwards i couldnt even picture to myself what to do with the subjugated object

9308158 we thought she was cool and edgy but it turns out she was merely performing her job
9308159 the cost of funds for us has decreased so we decided to move ahead of the reserve bank because the reserve bank may not even move they may or they may not
9308160 weve made a cut notwithstanding if the reserve bank do or do not raise their rates if they dont raise their rates our cut remains
9308161 i dont think the other lenders need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing by families under pressure and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9308162 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week therell be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9308163 there have been changes in the cost of funding in recent times and they will have an impact over time so over time the banks should be coming down over and above any cut in the reserves rate
9308164 theres no doubt that banks and other lenders went up in a nanosecond when the reserve bank went up and they should come down as quickly when the reserve bank comes down
9308165 over and above that there have been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9308166 the storm havent been as vulnerable the last two seasons as they have the last month the warriors got them over there and newcastle got them last night
9308167 its just not a one horse race but theyre still the favourites
9308168 were all capable of beating each other and i think that happened with the storm last night
9308169 i think brian smith has shown the gameplan to beat melbourne youve got to move the ball around you cant just hit it up through the forwards because they get defenders in
9308170 last night newcastle played a high intensity game they moved the ball moved the storm around they kicked away from billy slater and took him out of the game and their gameplan worked to perfection
9308171 its going to be a bit of a struggle now id imagine
9308172 obviously its a thing weve tried to put out of our minds and just concentrate on playing each week
9308173 but obviously our concentration wasnt great this week given our performance so well just worry about our performance and hopefully get it right next week
9308174 i didnt think it was one everything was wrong we didnt show a lot of competitive nature today
9308175 we had everything to play for three blokes leaving it was disappointing we didnt give a yelp
9308176 everything you pride yourself on as a player im not sure whether too many of the blokes ticked any of those boxes in any of those areas
9308177 were 16th for a reason attitude and non competitiveness have been the two big problems that weve had
9308178 decisions have to be made there and theyre not all my decisions
9308179 were now locked and loaded and ready to be able to put in some sort of challenge going into next year
9308180 do we go with the group that weve got at the moment wholly and solely or can we go out into the marketplace and add to that
9308181 thats a financial decision its not always a footy decision
9308182 id like to think the club would now give us an opportunity to go to the marketplace but well see
9308183 weve felt the wrath of what melbourne are going through at the moment and theyll come out the other side of it
9308184 what im pleased about for our supporter base is thats where weve been and now they can clearly see thats the gulf between us and what is 16th place now

9308213 we are angry not because we were attacked but because we were attacked by a book obscene in the extreme sense of the word

9308216 just because your tax notices arent going down we believe that they are going down across the state
9308217 my market value is down almost 30 percent thirty percent i have more exemptions than i did last year because im a senior now and they passed the tax reform but im paying almost the same in taxes how can that be
9308218 theyre talking out both sides of their faces i think they used that as an excuse to cut services
9308219 i guarantee you i cant sell that house for 408 000 my point is if prices have been going down for more than a year why isnt my tax bill showing it
9308220 a good scrubbing with random data will do about as well as can be expected
9308221 we are trying to make cuts in areas that have the least impact to residents
9308222 its a difficult year on all levels but the city of weston is prepared
9308223 some people have a foolish way of not minding or pretending not to mind what they eat for my part i mind my belly very studiously and very carefully for i look upon it that he who does not mind his belly will hardly mind anything else

9308229 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9308230 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9308231 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9308232 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9308233 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9308234 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9308235 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9308236 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9308237 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9308238 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9308239 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9308240 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
9308241 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9308242 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9308243 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9308244 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
9308245 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9308246 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9308247 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9308248 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9308249 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
9308250 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
9308251 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
9308252 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
9308253 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9308254 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9308255 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9308256 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9308257 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9308258 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9308259 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9308260 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9308261 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9308262 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9308263 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9308264 who are open to doing something on the production side
9308265 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9308266 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9308267 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9308268 qui que soit son colistier lam rique sait quel est le programme de m mccain
9308269 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9308270 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9308271 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9308272 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9308273 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9308274 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9308275 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
9308276 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9308277 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9308278 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9308279 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9308280 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9308281 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9308282 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9308283 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9308284 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9308285 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9308286 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

9308296 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9308297 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9308298 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions

9308300 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9308301 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers

9308306 ich konnte einen platz gutmachen und meine position bis zum ende meines stints verteidigen das team ist wirklich gut und hat einen gro artigen job gemacht die strategie war perfekt
9308307 eine gute teamleistung wir hatten dieses mal auch ein bisschen gl ck james fuhr mit den reifen aus der qualifikation das auto f hlte sich gut an hatte nur ein bisschen untersteuern wir fuhren sehr lange mit diesen reifen und ich glaube sie h tten keine zehn runden mehr durchgehalten es war sehr knapp
9308308 it is time to recognise the incalculable value of wetlands to all species including ours
9308309 if we dont plan and invest properly now the cost to recreate artificially the services wetlands provide will dwarf the cost of preserving and protecting them in the first place
9308310 some countries have high standards for wetlands management restoration and protection however many others are far behind
9308311 biofuel production has led to a large loss of wetlands in the us already
9308312 they are now growing as much corn to produce biofuels as they used to export out of the country
9308313 it is more profitable now to farm right up to the edge of a stream so we are losing wetlands in the us from this alone
9308314 if you do not grow the corn while the price is high then somebody else is going to produce it maybe on a key wetland site
9308315 this is an example of how interrelationships are not considered when we make decisions
9308316 although that they may be 3 5 of the terrestrial surface wetlands store about 20 of all terrestrial carbon which amounts to 500 700 gigatonnes
9308317 we are releasing on a net basis about 3 5 gigatonnes into the atmosphere so any small change in the carbon from wetlands going into the atmosphere has a big impact
9308318 the places where it is going to proportionally warm the greatest is towards the arctic that region has an awful lot of wetlands
9308319 you put food in a refrigerator at home to keep it cool if you dont it begins to rot
9308320 the carbon is stored under the permafrost meaning it is permanently frozen
9308321 the ice is receding so the carbon that is stored there is going to be released and that is a problem
9308322 but no by your lord they can have no faith until they make you judge in all disputed matters between them and find in themselves no resistance against your decision and accept them with full submission
9308323 i leave you with two things as long as you hold them tightly you never go astray they are the book of allah and my sunnah

9308342 obama i think hes a piece of shit i dont care that his mother was white i dont think he has enough brains to do anything good all hes living off of is the color of his skin to get elected i dont think america wants a black president most of them are too afraid to say that they believe the way i believe they sit around their dinner table and talk the way i do but when they get out in public they have two faces and show the other face when people are voting in the booth privately theyll vote republican even if theyre a democrat if he wins ill laugh i dont like mccain but hes the only one i can vote for hes against a lot of the things that im for im afraid that hes going to mess with gun laws but im going republican and i talked to my guys and most of them are voting for mccain too
9308343 obama might be a better candidate for our cause because hes racially conscious one of our big things in the national alliance is to raise the racial consciousness of our people young whites in universities theyve been stripped of any kind of racial identity obama may be a racist in a positive sense for his people that will awaken a lot of the whites knock some sense into them theyll see that non white americans are allowed to be proud of who they are to be racially conscious to talk about their people or their community without being attacked as being racist lets face it white people arent going to fight for their causes for their kind with a white president i dont think mccain even acknowledges that a white race exists hes all about granting amnesty to illegal aliens the fact he wants to keep us in wars in the middle east for 100 years thats not a good thing i give obama credit he seems to have stuck to his guns as far as pulling the troops out of iraq hes a very intelligent man an excellent speaker and has charisma john mccain offers none of that perhaps the best thing for the white race is to have a black president my only problem with obama is perhaps hes not black enough
9308344 if we were one tenth as serious we might start getting somewhere
9308345 white people are faced with either a negro or a total nutter who happens to have a pale face personally id prefer the negro national socialists are not mindless haters here i see a white man who is almost dead who declares he wants to fight endless wars around the globe to make the world safe for judeo capitalist exploitation who supports the invasion of america by illegals basically a continuation of the last eight years of emperor bush then we have a black man who loves his own kind belongs to a black nationalist religion is married to a black women when usually negroes who have made it immediately land a white spouse as a kind of prize thats the kind of negro that i can respect any time that a prominent person embraces their racial heritage in a positive manner its good for all racially minded folks besides america cares nothing for the interests of the white american worker while having a love affair with just about every non white on planet earth itd be poetic justice to have a non white as titular chief over this decaying modern sodom and gomorrah
9308346 finding out barack obama is the democratic nominee for president was one of the saddest days in black history another legacy of black death is about to begin just like it began back in the 60s with probably the greatest traitor to black people in modern day history martin luther king every black leader that has some form of power has given black people false hope when in fact the closer they get to the white establishment the more they become an actual enemy to black people black people need to move away from the establishment and towards a moral change as for obama first of all hes not even a black man in the terms of what real black people consider a black man hes of african and white descent how easily he dismissed his affiliation with reverend wright was a clear indication that this is a politician not a man of any real conviction the same way he threw away that reverend once he becomes president he must throw away black people hes going to have to harm black people to make white people satisfied that hes not reverend wrights boy the disappointment were going to suffer from him is going to set us back another fifty years mccain is definitely the better shot for black people

9308374 i am very excited that la trobe university will be offering a course in islamic banking and finance ibf by learning about islamic commercial laws i can help the people of my community in their development
9308375 as the concept of interest is considered haram prohibited in islam there are many muslims who need financial support for their progress i feel that islamic commercial law can overcome this problem
9308376 such immense growth has brought islamic finance to the attention of the international banking community prompting major banks to set up islamic financial windows to take advantage of the demand for shariah compliant finance
9308377 islamic banking is a community activity based on equity and security between lender and borrower it seeks to encourage distribution of wealth profit and loss is shared by stakeholders on a proportional basis and there is no unnecessary exposure to risk and no ambiguity in the contract
9308378 maximising profit is not the major objective of this system
9308379 in iran and saudi arabia more than 95 percent of all retail banking transaction is done through islamic banking institutions it is expected that islamic finance will be the mainstream finance in the rest of the gulf region in a couple of decades
9308380 in pakistan islamic finance is booming in bangladesh microfinance is moving on shariah compliance according to the bankers november 2007 issue in malaysia islamic institutions are expected to capture 25 percent of the market share of assets owned by 2010
9308381 there will be high demand for this course from students coming from hyderabad aligarh kashmir ahmedabad
9308382 the new course is designed to meet a very real need the course merges western and islamic finance with modern techniques islamic banks will account for 40 to 50 percent of total savings of muslim populations worldwide in 8 10 years
9308383 in case any student objects to the marks the matter will be scrutinized by experts at the department concerned including the department head
9308384 the system will ensure a fully fair marking system especially one which addresses common errors like totalling of marks and adequate checks have also been formulated to prevent misuse of the new system
9308385 the system will eliminate need for re evaluation process which was time consuming and also costly as copies were re checked mostly by outstation examiners besides students going for re evaluation wait for months to get the revalued marks
9308386 the programme will now comprise of six semesters two semesters every year which makes bhu perhaps the only university in the country to have semester based b sc programme

9308390 yes im with you im keeping track and im aware
9308391 because of the nature of global telecommunications we are playing with a tremendous home field advantage and we need to exploit that edge
9308392 we also need to protect that edge and we need to protect those who provide it to us
9308393 there is an ongoing concern that u s intelligence agencies will gather this information without legal process there is particular sensitivity about access to financial information as well as communications and internet traffic that goes through u s switches
9308394 its no different than any other infrastructure that a country needs

9308397 we hope that everyone will be impressed with the new look centre and everything it has to offer
9308398 the changes in climate will increase and become more unstable
9308399 if we have learned anything from past expeditions it is that the forces that will be released against us will not be manageable
9308400 we will use science as the lens to inspire and actively engage people in new ways of seeing and understanding the world the students responses to their remarkable journey and the changing landscape of the polar region will assist us in achieving this vision
9308401 a man with no guts who liked people to bow down to him
9308402 he liked to think he was omnipotent he thought he was above it all
9308403 he was a weak character but he liked to have people worship him
9308404 obviously this gentleman ivins has committed suicide i dont think it was very effective to warn him that he was about to be charged and allow him to commit suicide like this that seems pretty shoddy to me

9308409 plenary authority to conduct routine searches and seizures at the border without probable cause or a warrant
9308410 the most dangerous contraband is often contained in laptop computers or other electronic devices
9308411 as a practical matter travelers only go to secondary for a more thorough examination when there is some level of suspicion
9308412 yet legislation locking in a particular standard for searches would have a dangerous chilling effect as officers often split second assessments are second guessed
9308413 im not too concerned about the numbers to be frank
9308414 it hurts when you lose you can chase the statistics all you like but the fact was it was a belting
9308415 if you lose a test by one or more than one you came second
9308416 i dont go home and look at the scores in fact i am quite often not even conscious of the scoreboard
9308417 but you have a fair idea whether you get home or not thats the whole point
9308418 it might have helped the mindset ours and theirs if we had scored early but its done and dusted
9308419 obviously the defence dropped away the enthusiasm in defence dropped away
9308420 it was the reverse of last week in many ways
9308421 possibly we became a little bit outcome orientated in the way we approached the game because when the outcome went so did some of the effort
9308422 they had two pretty valuable components today that served them well
9308423 one was they were desperate and the other was they were uninhibited nothing to lose so theres a powerful mix when you get your foot in the door particularly when youve been suffering for a while
9308424 when you start to get a roll on everything sticks and you enjoy it youre excited and it becomes very difficult to stop
9308425 obviously in the back of our minds its not the best but you move on

9308454 los patrones de discriminaci n y violencia contra la mujer fueron extremados durante el conflicto armado porque se dio un modelo masculino de militar que interven a en las zonas de emergencia donde m s bravo era el que m s mujeres violaba donde un arma de guerra era la violencia sexual
9308455 el mensaje era no eres lo suficientemente var n para proteger a tu mujer a tus hijas a tu madre y yo las violo una forma de poder esgrimida por los militares pero tambi n por los subversivos
9308456 muchas mujeres salieron a buscar a sus muertos y de esta forma eran vulnerables en las bases las enga aban y para darles alguna informaci n las obligaban a tener relaciones sexuales esto no era voluntario en un contexto de conflicto armado no existe voluntad por parte una v ctima

9308460 se entregan armas se indican lugares de ajusticiamientos pero no se dice nada de la violencia sexual y hay que hacerlo hay que decir que s ha ocurrido y que sigue pasando no somos las v ctimas las que tenemos que tener verg enza son ellos los violadores los que deben sentirla
9308461 i was appalled at how flimsy the case is i was also appalled at the behaviour of many of those who helped produce the ipcc reports and by many of those who promote it

9308473 i wont set the precedent of playing a player that doesnt practice
9308474 i started with my family just riding our bikes together
9308475 i had a horse but one day i told my dad i wanted to trade the thing in and get a motorcycle ive been racing pretty much ever since
9308476 i still love horses to this day but i guess my cousins and uncles everyone around me were riding their bikes and it seemed like a lot more fun so i went in that direction
9308477 but this is an enjoyable place to race it will be fun
9308478 its tough to describe for me like i said ive been doing since i was four so its pretty much like walking when youre not on the bike your brain is thinking how am i going to do that but when you get on the bike it just happens
9308479 its definitely difficult to explain but ive had the opportunity to drive some race cars and and some street bikes and none of that comes close to the buzz you get in supercross i dont know if its the amount of power you have or the jumps or what its just so intense being in a stadium with 60 000 people watching us do what we love
9308480 the team i was on then we had some trouble with our fuel and i was docked 25 points
9308481 we were doing a good job and i looked at the scoreboard and it was only 12 10
9308482 it shows you what untimely turnovers and penalties can do it kept the game close
9308483 the sec plays such a rigorous conference schedule most can afford to schedule down for the first couple of games
9308484 its understandable for them to do that but we have to take these opportunities when we get them
9308485 this team can be as good as it wants to be
9308486 we have to do a better job but were 1 0
9308487 he went to italy with the knowledge of the foreign office in order to develop his contacts he greatly exceeded his instructions
9308488 there is no doubt that bryans with or without authority from lord halifax endeavoured to go to germany to contact german foreign minister ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself
9308489 as this team moves forward they might listen more closely to their coaches rather than the outside
9308490 its a great thing when a coach prepares a team and then his word is substantiated
9308491 we knew we could move the ball on them we had been doing it all game we just cant afford that many fumbles especially in one quarter i dont think that we panicked at all
9308492 everyone is happy to start out 1 0 but we realize the game shouldnt have looked quite like that
9308493 we wanted to force that quarterback freshman steven threet to beat us at the end
9308494 we had some penalties but well coach that up we played well
9308495 but the defense fought until the end every time i looked up in the fourth quarter it was like they were adding time to the clock
9308496 there were a lot of people doing great things out there
9308497 we stopped their run game we held our poise we had to dig deep to play those last downs and we did exactly that
9308498 as soon as i saw it i threw my hands up i knew it was going in
9308499 im just going to delete the blocks from my memory
9308500 there were a lot of places we need to clean up
9308501 so how does michigans defense compare to the ones you face in the wac
9308502 we have a veteran group and we know how to win
9308503 that is absurd to talk in those terms right now we have played one good football team and won one on the road which is nice but we have 11 left
9308504 i was surprised how open i was i would be running routes and i would be running by myself sometimes
9308505 max did a good job of delivering the ball on target and seeing the field we just moved the ball well on offense and exploited their weaknesses on defense
9308506 when they do that it does provide an opportunity for the middle and the offense took what the scheme made available dennis is just a quality enough player to capitalize on that as the scheme presented it to him
9308507 it took a couple plays to get the jitters out but i had fun
9308508 i wasnt trying to hurt him just trying to put everything into my hit that i could
9308509 byus a tough team and i also want my team to play tough like that
9308510 consider the schar wages of a sin compared to its loss

9308517 krabi airport resumed normal service since early sunday morning the first flight from bangkok has landed there are no protesters left since the morning
9308518 its nice to have those mistakes happen and still win
9308519 its a great thing when a coach prepares his team and his word is substantiated
9308520 they might listen more closely to their coaches than to the outside

9308531 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9308532 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9308533 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9308534 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9308535 but i think everyone on this field will tell you tonights game was more important than any game in the world series
9308536 in the regional he must have thrown 110 pitches in the game and out of 110 he threw about 108 fastballs
9308537 the guy had no breaking ball i never saw anything like it
9308538 the issue most of his starts is he didnt need to throw it because he only needed his fastball
9308539 like the example the scout gave you he threw 95 percent fastballs all year long
9308540 the guy showed me a plus breaking ball plus velocity on his fastball and a plus curve
9308541 he threw strikes and while the second time the curve wasnt quite as good he had the makings of a very good curve
9308542 youre talking two plus pitches an above average fastball and an above average curve
9308543 brad made a lot of progress this year he cleaned his delivery up had better direction and was able to stay back over the rubber and it improved his location and velocity
9308544 i think it was a combination of velocity and location
9308545 he was able to locate the majority of the year where thatd been an issue his first two years with us
9308546 thats what makes the blog interesting someone else will take up the argument
9308547 the health blogosphere what it means for policy debates and journalism
9308548 this is a phenomenal team that had a remarkable season last year
9308549 i was very proud to see the giants pull off the amazing victory in the super bowl and i feel honored and blessed to be here with the team right now
9308550 i dont know how well thats going to work out as far as what he can really do to help the jets take them to the next level
9308551 because i just dont see it as an opportunity for that team to go to the super bowl
9308552 i think hes going to bring a spark without a doubt solidify that quarterback position but for how long thats the question is it a one year deal two years three
9308553 there are still a lot of question marks out there as to how long hes going to play i dont know if his impact the first year is going to be enough to get the jets over the hump because they are in a very tough division with the patriots
9308554 the jets are still in a tough situation and i dont know if he brings enough
9308555 in this business if you dont win the super bowl then it really doesnt mean anything
9308556 if he is the guy who played two years ago for green bay and is careless and wreckless with the ball this will be an unmitigated disaster but if he plays half as good or three quarters as good as he played last year this will be a resounding success
9308557 i told him i was right here so if he wanted to come out
9308558 he just kept talking it seemed like he got a little more fired up when 24 teammates were behind him i wasnt going to go anywhere
9308559 i miss baseball we will see after the rehab process begins
9308560 my last four years has been season to season when i talked to mike about coming here we never discussed it he was just trying to get me to come at first
9308561 and then once we knew the deal was going to be done he wouldve liked to have a two year commitment and i said mike let me give you the best year i can possibly give you and lets go from there
9308562 im not going to say i didnt get ticked but if you sat every one of those green bay players and coaches down separately and they knew their job was not in jeopardy and you asked them what kind of guy is brett i know what theyd tell you
9308563 im confident in how ive treated people those in packers management were throwing daggers to make themselves look like they were in the right
9308564 i could have told them ill come back even though at the time i didnt want to
9308565 but then july rolls around we start camp or whatever and i go god i need to walk away to me that was worse than saying guys if you want an answer right now im not 100 percent committed and because of that im retiring
9308566 the day i told packers head coach mike mccarthy i was going to retire he said are you sure i said no im not sure but you want an answer so im giving you an answer i told him im not confident in this decision i was second guessing it from day one
9308567 nieograniczon dz rz du stan w zjednoczonych i globalnego syjonizmu
9308568 dont worry about it well get another shot at em
9308569 but its not like the kids are in high school
9308570 my priority remains signing with the rangers and finishing the job i came here to do two years ago ive spoken with tom renney and have told him that im willing to accept whatever role he thinks is best for the team
9308571 i want to stay in new york because i believe i can contribute but if that door closes ill have some other interesting options to consider
9308572 i dont know if everything is on hold because of mats sundin
9308573 it seems like his situation has frozen teams around the league
9308574 its always disappointing but its a program the league has set up and something i understand and jesse understands the consequences of
9308575 jesse has had a very good training camp punctuated by the eagles game hes disappointed and so am i but im looking forward to him coming back and being able contribute
9308576 jesse never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9308577 after spending great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now jesse has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9308578 jeter and i are always in canos ear and hopefully he doesnt make that mistake again
9308579 its a play he works on hes good at it
9308580 if we would have done this in april and may we might have burned some people out
9308581 because we didnt do it in april and may they are available to do it now
9308582 obviously there are spots youre going to have to give the bullpen a day off but they have not been overworked and thats good for us
9308583 well wait and see how he feels today and then well make a decision
9308584 if he comes out feeling good today i dont really have too many concerns
9308585 when he starts out obviously its another great arm on our staff and thats what you want
9308586 you want a long list of great arms on your staff and hes another one he gives us more depth down there in the bullpen and its important this time of year
9308587 honestly ive done both so whatever they want me to do is what i want to do so well see
9308588 you have to look at it and be smart about your body and tell them how you feel
9308589 we do probably have to find out what can be a little more consistent than what weve gotten
9308590 its a tight spot when you walk the leadoff guy
9308591 hanley certainly wasnt a guy that i wanted to walk its definitely frustrating
9308592 ive got to give credit to him because it was running away from him and he stepped up there and hooked it it was a good piece of hitting
9308593 everybody in the bullpen just needs keep working working and working and eventually its gotta turn around
9308594 i had my own personal reasons and the whole damned country was depending on me
9308595 we were doing a good job and i looked at the scoreboard and it was only 12 10
9308596 it shows you what untimely turnovers and penalties can do it kept the game close
9308597 the sec plays such a rigorous conference schedule most can afford to schedule down for the first couple of games
9308598 its understandable for them to do that but we have to take these opportunities when we get them
9308599 i wont set the precedent of playing a player that doesnt practice

9308605 cest un v nement que nous cr ons avec ce premier rassemblement
9308606 je reste totalement sur le mandat confi par lensemble des militants
9308607 ce qui compte cest une ligne r formiste pour pr senter un projet ambitieux mais aussi r aliste
9308608 we studied all the numbers theres a 90 percent assurance you never get beyond the one backup quarterback
9308609 number one we have talented players number two i believe theyre focused and still hungry with something to prove
9308610 theyre veteran players and theyve seen an awful lot in this game and theyve been able to react to it from the standpoint of reuben we have a pretty good group of guys at running back and felt like they were all worthy of making an nfl team and they have so many roles that they can play reuben can be a fullback he can be a running back he can be a special teams player he can be a short yardage and goal line guy he has a lot of hats he can wear
9308611 they were pretty lifeless until we made a mistake and they capitalized on it
9308612 he made an unbelievable play i dont know how he made that play and to get two outs it just leaves you speechless
9308613 i pitched better than that just some crazy stuff happened
9308614 i guess he got upset tonight i hit him again and he started talking i hit him with two strikes i actually did him a favor you know i guess he was upset he called me the p word i told him i was right here he just kept talking
9308615 it was one of those heat of the moment situations luckily it didnt get out of hand it wasnt that big of a deal i dont want to blow it up that much
9308616 first of all i dont really guarantee thats not the business im in but i fully fully fully anticipate kellen being on the roster on opening day unless something earth shattering happens
9308617 jesse chatman of the new york jets has been suspended without pay for the teams first four regular season games of 2008 for violating the nfl policy on steroids and related substances
9308618 chatmans suspension begins on saturday august 30 he is eligible to return to the jets active roster on monday september 29 following the teams september 28 game against the chatmans agent brett tessler reached last night texted the following to newsday
9308619 jesse never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9308620 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent after spending great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling and now jesse has no choice but to look ahead to week 5
9308621 all the specific details are confidential theres not a lot i can add in terms of details im disappointed but i look forward to having him back
9308622 but at the same time i respect the program the league has in place one violation and there are consequences
9308623 my experience with jesse since hes been a jet has been extremely positive
9308624 hes done everything weve asked theres a lot of things i really like about the player and the person its something that has happened its something you never want to see but thats where we are
9308625 this team can be as good as it wants to be
9308626 we have to do a better job but were 1 0
9308627 as soon as i saw it i threw my hands up i knew it was going in
9308628 im just going to delete the blocks from my memory
9308629 there were a lot of places we need to clean up
9308630 we wanted to force that quarterback freshman steven threet to beat us at the end
9308631 we had some penalties but well coach that up we played well
9308632 but the defense fought until the end every time i looked up in the fourth quarter it was like they were adding time to the clock
9308633 there were a lot of people doing great things out there
9308634 we stopped their run game we held our poise we had to dig deep to play those last downs and we did exactly that
9308635 me nothing just sort of setting everything up for the next guy
9308636 hes still influential in congress he still has supporters in congress and in the district
9308637 consult our travel advice and consult the us hurricane centre warnings but most importantly follow advice of local authorities
9308638 as we understand it there are 12 parishes or local areas in louisiana recommending or requiring evacuation
9308639 it shows a lot about our football team that we dug ourselves a pretty big hole against a good football team and we came out of it
9308640 presbyterian is a good team and they are going to win a lot of football games one of the big things for us was we made some adjustments defensively and basically told the guys to settle down and play your technique
9308641 i think offensively on the line of scrimmage we started to create some space and got the ball inside and outside then took it straight at them we had some big pass plays and i was pleased with the ways our kids got after it
9308642 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9308643 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9308644 the state government shall set aside for the use by the shri amarnathji shrine board exclusively the land in baltal and gumel compartment number 63 a sindh forest division comprising an area of 800 kanals 40 hectares traditionally in use for the annual yatra purposes
9308645 we have decided to suspend the agitation as there has to be some follow up
9308646 im very happy today all the sacrifices made by the activists during the agitation has paid off we have got the land
9308647 it is a happy day for us after almost three months people had come out since five in the morning but the government has imposed a curfew in the area saying militants have been sighted in the region but we do not know what the actual case is
9308648 we are here to pray for his holinesses good health he is in mumbai in a hospital and i think he is already discharged from the hospital he is remaining there for another few days taking rest after that he will come back to dharamsala
9308649 now vat refunds could be directly deposited in the dealers account
9308650 in todays time the new phones are very advanced and high tech and people are looking for that only they have been waiting anxiously for i phones just because its having a multi touch interface people are more aware of technology and they prefer buying latest gazettes
9308651 all youngsters want to have new technology feature phone i think thats the main reason moreover they want some stylish phone also youngsters are very keen to change the phone quickly this is the main reason i think definitely the trend will rise in the next 6 to 8 months
9308652 its a status symbol product and secondly customer wants such a gazette which you can use in different ways like mails editing as well as mobile phones i phone is basically a touch screen handset and customers are really crazy to buy that with wi fi and camera

9308658 trade openness is believed to have been central to the remarkable growth of developed countries since the mid 20th century and an important factor behind the poverty alleviation experienced in most of the developing world since the early 1990s

9308660 president kennedy who introduced the tokyo round famously said this will lift all boats and help developing countries like japan case made i would have thought
9308661 africa critically needs to realise development and get itself out of poverty through the establishment of fair trade rather than aid
9308662 the aggressive push by the rich countries led by the u s and the eu for more trade liberalisation at a time of global crises of food and fuel became too blatant for developing countries to stomach
9308663 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks they looked great

9308690 i never thought id play for australia for it to happen is quite unbelievable
9308691 playing for australia its every boys dream so im very excited and if i can get another game in there at some stage it would be great
9308692 i was offered a job and i was going to take it and start on the monday
9308693 but i spoke to my father and he said no dont that would be pretty stupid
9308694 luckily i didnt and its all worked out quite well
9308695 kids even when theyre sick are resilient theyre upbeat and hopeful and we wanted to give them that kind of environment
9308696 several more pics at the link which im aware is 4chan but po is not at all like b so dont worry about what youll see
9308697 were not looking to call an evacuation and havent issued a state of emergency
9308698 its not going to come this way and were on the dry side anyway we may experience tropical force winds by tuesday
9308699 but as it moves into a less favorable environment in the north central gulf of mexico where the water temperatures are cooler it could encounter wind shear
9308700 we could get some rain bands out of it and theres the possibility of tropical force winds depending on where it is
9308701 we got everybodys telephone number and would call with instructions
9308702 we have 600 in texas city and about 1 100 or 1 200 on the mainland and several thousand in galveston
9308703 during rita we sent out everybody on school buses with no restrooms
9308704 it wasnt that comfortable and they traveled a long distance but it worked and would have saved lives
9308705 i was looking at the parking and getting a feel for what the needs are for the court water district and library
9308706 were over the contingency and i dont know where the funding will come from beyond that
9308707 maybe it will come out of savings down the road or from general revenue
9308708 the decisions to use the moneys to supplement the city hall project occurred despite the repeated forecast of a softening economy
9308709 were on schedule with the structural steel foundation and metal deck
9308710 the city is doing site improvements paving parking lots and drives
9308711 weve always stressed that people need to bring their own bedding
9308712 in a situation like a hurricane theres not time to bring hundreds of thousands of cots into one location
9308713 hopefully news coverage will be heavy and tell people when the roads are clear or when grocery stores are open
9308714 who knows the university of texas medical branch or mainland medical center might not be fully operational you have to gauge what there is to come back to like a worst case scenario but i certainly hope we dont see that
9308715 theres not much good in coming back in town if there is no electricity or no grocery stores to provide food after the storm makes landfall well determine how quickly to allow people back in
9308716 now that theyve emptied the garage im worried theyll move on to the house
9308717 we know theres people watching waiting for something to be left out
9308718 as long as there are a large number of people addicted to narcotics that live on this island well always have a problem with theft
9308719 you would expect that youd be able to put a potted plant on your porch but thats not the case
9308720 some people stealing is part of their culture and part of their life
9308721 to them its a 24 hour a day job if they want it bad enough theyre going to get it you have to remain vigilant against that
9308722 we will use it primarily for catastrophic storms as a way to safely evacuate in phases to get the galveston county population ahead of the regional population
9308723 at least we know weve got something and thats better than nothing when it comes to an orderly evacuation of the region
9308724 if some decide they cant live without air conditioning and theyre not in the danger zone and dont want to take a chance we have no control over that
9308725 people were more nervous than they had ever been for a hurricane when they saw the same storm on the same track over the course of five days anxiety levels were very high
9308726 nu ik ben het weekend de molen wezen bekijken en het is bijna de oude molen weer
9308727 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9308728 i just tremble i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9308729 i know you want a child and you have every right to want a child but does the child want you if you are going to put it in childcare at six weeks
9308730 i dont think the child wants you to tell the honest truth i know thats incredibly controversial
9308731 were going to look back on this time from the late 90s onwards with putting children in childcare so early in their first year of life for such long hours and wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9308732 when they have the good house the good car the good job were talking about very advantaged people they have everything and they think now we need a baby which we can dress up and make look perfect
9308733 he went to italy with the knowledge of the foreign office in order to develop his contacts he greatly exceeded his instructions
9308734 there is no doubt that bryans with or without authority from lord halifax endeavoured to go to germany to contact german foreign minister ribbentrop and if possible hitler himself
9308735 although there seems to be a good deal to be said for locking him up to prevent him airing his views to all and sundry i understand that if this is done it will inevitably involve his bringing up the question of his contacts with the foreign office and the facilities afforded him to go to italy

9308753 it was part of the game of being a fashion designer but that doesnt turn me on anymore what turns me on my soul is making cool clothes and being part of a company where i can actually see the difference im making im not just spinning my wheels and getting the clothes into five stores in america
9308754 im extremely proud of the fact that after all these years some of the top designers in the world are using hammer influence

9308764 due artisti dissimili per etica e tradizione artistica ma uniti da un sorprendente filo conduttore la creativit la morte che li coglie nellanno considerato la dead line di unepoca del mondo arriva per entrambi improvvisamente a roma luno il 3 settembre laltro dopo un terribile incidente di motocicletta l 11 settembre nella ricorrenza della loro comune scomparsa si celebra unincontro fatale che anche qui a spoleto stato teatro di coincidenze insospettabili
9308765 e indubbio che proprio leoncillo nella sua ultima stagione informale e pascali nel suo naturalismo elementare siano ormai da considerare i due veri grandi antesignani della scultura italiana nella seconda met del secolo xx i protagonisti dellepisodio che serv da raccordo tra linformale e lapparizione dellarte povera da un lato e del minimalismo dallaltro
9308766 sembra che pascali e leoncillo siano riusciti a liberare la scultura dalle collocazioni ordinarie delle tre dimensioni quelle usuali e inevitabili quello che certo che entrambi hanno cercato di pervenire ad una forma di spazialit diversa della scultura tradizionale entrambi hanno segnato i confini estremi di uno stesso territorio le due frontiere pi lontane di un identico impero quello della scultura
9308767 i know exactly what this is this cloud is simply hosting

9308771 why did you buy gears of war when you dont even have an xbox 360
9308772 the 360s are getting cheaper and they are always in stock at my local wal mart and gamestop stores so i have time to get one but as games get released the older titles get harder and harder to find so that is why i got gears of war before getting a 360
9308773 well now you get the chance to be a blessing to others so you can help lead them to experience what you have felt

9308781 i feel sorry for the county bowlers whom he is smashing at the moment i would love him to deliver what he does in county cricket in international cricket it is such a sad case
9308782 i think from what i see he was doing a brilliant job i havent heard the criticism or negative things
9308783 hes more than capable of doing what he needs to do he has a team around him that assists him getting the team where they need to be
9308784 its not bad we were a medal short on what was predicted i dont think my performance papers over cracks

9308804 yesterday thursday we were seeing more of a southwest movement but today we are seeing more of a west northwest movement and only slightly faster than what we saw yesterday
9308805 its still heading toward the louisiana coast with the midtrack line
9308806 however with the large cone of error still possible the entire texas coast is still under a threat with any areas from corpus christi to the northeast under some kind of significant threat
9308807 given what we know now at h minus 92 hurricane gustav presents a very very clear and present threat to the state of texas as a category four hurricane forecasts predict a category three storm but state officials always plan for one category up
9308808 the impact area is unknown with any specifics but our priority right now for planning our priority for execution beginning tomorrow is southeast texas thats beaumont orange jefferson hardin and chambers counties to get those medical special needs moved out of there
9308809 the state of texas will begin now to pre deploy resources to beaumont houston and galveston
9308810 well be prepared to begin air operations at 9 a m tomorrow morning in the beaumont port arthur area medical special needs evacuees
9308811 i dont think you could be prouder to be a texan today as you see the cooperation over the labor day weekend across the state
9308812 so if youre an evacuated community i hope you sleep well tonight knowing there is a whole lot of communities across texas working this weekend for your citizens in the event that they evacuate
9308813 that is a very humbling thought when you think about the scope of this
9308814 obviously fill up fuel tanks obviously have water dust off your hurricane campaigns whatever youre personally doing and get that kind of thing ready
9308815 and let family members know outside of matagorda county when and where you are planning on going
9308816 we only do mandatory evacuations for citizens living below the intercoastal in the event that the bridges are going to get locked
9308817 one of the things that is so hard is to get people to not look at the center line
9308818 look at that cone of error there that the national weather service puts out
9308819 so many people look at that center line and say well we dont have anything to worry about and they wait until its pointed directly at us
9308820 we can usually cook what people want when they make requests
9308821 and our menu is constantly getting additional items sometimes we have a fish fry and sometimes we have other dishes that people request
9308822 we take call in orders all the time so that working people can stop by and pick up their food to go
9308823 the best thing about our store is our family of employees
9308824 no one works for someone we all just work together
9308825 and it goes without saying that we love our customers too
9308826 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
9308827 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
9308828 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
9308829 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
9308830 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
9308831 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
9308832 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
9308833 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
9308834 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
9308835 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
9308836 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
9308837 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
9308838 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
9308839 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
9308840 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
9308841 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
9308842 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
9308843 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
9308844 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
9308845 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
9308846 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
9308847 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
9308848 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
9308849 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
9308850 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
9308851 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
9308852 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
9308853 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
9308854 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
9308855 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
9308856 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
9308857 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
9308858 the first thing that will help you make positive memories is there has to be positive choices on your part
9308859 people who attempt great things and fail are infinitely better off than those who attempt nothing and succeed
9308860 dream big and dont be afraid to go for it
9308861 when difficult situations come your way you wont have to wonder what youll do if your values are solid
9308862 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
9308863 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
9308864 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
9308865 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
9308866 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
9308867 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
9308868 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
9308869 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
9308870 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
9308871 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
9308872 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
9308873 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
9308874 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
9308875 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
9308876 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
9308877 were not only disappointed and frustrated over governments decision to turn its back on the ancestral domain deal weve completely lost trust and confidence in them the fate of the peace negotiation rests solely in the hands of the government
9308878 the dismissal of trumped up charges and release of tagaytay 5 is a victory for human rights
9308879 as the government continues to indiscriminately drop bombs on moro and christian villages in aleosan and pikit more and more civilians are displaced
9308880 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
9308881 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
9308882 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
9308883 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
9308884 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
9308885 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
9308886 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
9308887 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
9308888 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
9308889 we hope this fund raiser will help us raise at least 3 000 this year
9308890 we are shooting to have the museum opened by january
9308891 one of our first exhibits will be a piece on the significant historical influence of the vietnamese culture here in palacios
9308892 as you approach texas 60 between 12th street and adams look both ways
9308893 if you see the newly installed beacons on the backside of the school assemblies flashing the school speed limit is 20 mph
9308894 we will have extra patrol out on the streets next week mainly to remind the public that school is starting and we need to look out for the safety of the children
9308895 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
9308896 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
9308897 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
9308898 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
9308899 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
9308900 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
9308901 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
9308902 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
9308903 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
9308904 everything was going good until he started messing around on me
9308905 im sorry for shooting duke but he hurt me very bad love hurts and you dont play games with people s feelings
9308906 was going to shoot him in the leg but he wouldnt come around to my side of the car
9308907 after he beat her and threatened her with a gun he walked to his car aimed his gun into the air and fired it once as an exclamation point
9308908 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
9308909 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
9308910 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
9308911 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
9308912 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
9308913 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
9308914 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
9308915 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
9308916 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
9308917 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
9308918 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
9308919 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
9308920 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
9308921 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
9308922 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with
9308923 weve spent many a night at the hospital together on sexual assault calls

9308937 u weet dat wij dit voertuig kunnen laten takelen maar dat u wel eerst zelf de kosten moet betalen en dat u die daarna kunt terugvorderen via het vredegerecht
9308938 een zonale onderrichting meneer we hebben net met hoofdinspecteur vogel gecommuniceerd voor advies wij kunnen dit voertuig enkel laten takelen als u de kosten voorschiet

9308940 we zullen ook een pv opstellen meneer mogen wij uw identiteitskaart even alstublieft
9308941 going against the grain of course its fun he said
9308942 the reason why our community does this is because there is no space for us ms cook said
9308943 the chairman spoke to me recently about my future and he said that until i came up to him and told him i wanted to go then he wouldnt entertain any bids
9308944 im not going to do that because i dont want to leave im doing well at wigan
9308945 id been waiting for jermain to come good him and crouchie and it was nice to see them link up together
9308946 im not sure what mr capello will do hes got wayne rooney there but he will be in the squad im sure of that
9308947 glen is such a good player that he can play anywhere hes got everything you need as a right back
9308948 sometimes he can get a bit casual but in terms of ability hes absolutely top class
9308949 the keeper is different class that was a world class save in the first half to keep us 1 0 up and then to save the penalty as well hes a fantastic goalkeeper
9308950 its nice to have some english players at the club lassana diarra will also go and play for france as well so weve got some good players here
9308951 it was quite funny actually he said to me if you can play sylvain distin at left back then i can play steven gerrard on the left wing
9308952 i told him he wasnt wrong things get blown up but ive met him on several occasions and ive said if he cant bring success to england then god help us because hes got a fantastic record
9308953 were probably not ready to win premier league games at the moment
9308954 weve got a lot of young players in the side but its not those players who are letting us down
9308955 there are big players in the team not playing as well as they should be
9308956 michael will put pen to paper over the next 24 hours
9308957 we are delighted because he has a fantastic future and his decision to commit his future to this club is another example of the progress we are now making
9308958 were expecting news to get to the chairman after the game
9308959 well allow them to conduct their business and hopefully well get the thumbs up and be able to move on fraizer but at this moment in time i dont know
9308960 everybody tells you about the premier league and what its going to be like and wigan have had five shots on target and beaten us 5 0
9308961 was that the gulf in class i say to myself no at half time hull city were beating hull city
9308962 we slipped up at a set piece at one end and we slipped up from a set piece at the other end
9308963 that was a little detail that was the difference between the two teams and that gives me a little bit of hope
9308964 the premier league punishes you when you make a mistake or youre out of position hopefully paul mcshane will bring that premier league mentality
9308965 its a tough one to swallow i didnt think the gulf in the two teams was five goals
9308966 were only three games in of course but arguably its the worst weve played it sounds stupid enough but it is
9308967 we got off to a great start and then we got the second one and i said at half time that the first 20 minutes would be vital if they get one back then it could be a tough afternoon
9308968 it was difficult coming here make no mistake about that we thought it was going to be as hard as it was going to be
9308969 even after 20 minutes when we had scored two they were really up for it the crowd is going to be vital for them ive been involved with teams that come up and he brown has got some decent players
9308970 i thought the outstanding player on the pitch was valencia he had a fantastic match
9308971 zaki is doing what we thought he could do and all those trips to cairo have proved worthwhile
9308972 we hope that weve unearthed one there and we hope he keeps doing what he does which would be fantastic for us
9308973 having a public transport system which uses buses which are 30 years old or even older which fail modern emission tests goes to show that this important area has been neglected for far too long
9308974 old buses or at least bus engines which fail todays stricter standards should be written off and replaced
9308975 in this day and age we still are using buses with no space for wheelchairs or pushchairs or bicycles and which are difficult for some people to use it is high time for real change in this sector government should stop giving in to those who want to preserve the status quo at the expense of our quality of life
9308976 i think it will also make a difference if people unplug their tvs and their cable boxes and stereos
9308977 we have roughly monitors and just using that example if we shut down 100 percent globally for a year thats a 30 000 saving to taxpayers
9308978 i am loving it here everyone has been so welcoming and to see a whole town like this it is incredible what has been done here today
9308979 the kids have been well behaved and they even knew all the lines to the royle family i dont even remember the lines to the royle family
9308980 i hope that i will be asked back again in the future if workington puts another event like this on because we are in a beautiful part of the country and it has been a pleasure to be here
9308981 it has been a fantastic turn out by the people of workington and everyone can be very proud of the show that has been put on
9308982 a year of hard work has gone into making paint the town red happen and it has been a total success
9308983 from the rotary club to the shops and businesses in this town we have all done our bit and for me it is great to see so many families enjoying the day
9308984 it was absolutely stupendous i think for me the pinnacle of the day was when jimmy james was doing his finale and the fireworks went off overhead from curwen park
9308985 that was a truly spectacular moment the whole audience was bouncing and it just finished off the day perfectly it has put a mark down and set a stamp for the future
9308986 we always had great shows here and i think that today is one of them people can live together in a community and not meet but this kind of event brings them together
9308987 i hope it will get better and better as it goes on
9308988 it was awesome he put me in the boot while the car was on two wheels i was leaning out of the passenger seat when the car was on its side and waving out the window
9308989 i really enjoyed the day and i hope that its something that can be put on every year its absolutely great
9308990 i am pleased for workington and i hope this will come to equal whitehavens maritime festival
9308991 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9308992 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9308993 we should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the g7 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9308994 anyone whos thinking of staying rethink it get out of town
9308995 si tratta di una protesta pacifica senza disordini o incidenti

9308999 if you believe the politicians we have a broken society in which the courage and morals of young people have been sapped by welfarism and political correctness and if you look at what is happening at the olympics you can see what piffle that is
9309000 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitioners and roman catholic priests if you are looking for young heroes and role models forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control and consider the sacrifice being made by our soldiers in afghanistan and iraq

9309014 chelsea are currently in a situation where they are built to be champions or contenders in every trophy they care to enter
9309015 they have the ability to sign absolutely top echelon stars from anywhere around the world pick the cream of the crop to try and win every trophy we are kind of in a different league to that
9309016 maybe its a case of two clubs moving in slightly different directions
9309017 we had a sporting director a director of football if you like who was responsible for transfers and signings
9309018 youve got the chairman the sporting director and the manager currently myself
9309019 you get the feeling that the sooner the whole thing is finished the better
9309020 the chapter finally closes with the end of the transfer market i think there is going to be lots of reasonably furious action between now and then
9309021 without a doubt it has had an awful lot to do with the start to the season
9309022 with the comings and goings players are obviously trying their best to concentrate 100 but i think it has affected things slightly with their work on the training ground and even going into games it has been affected by this
9309023 it would have been great to have been a lot calmer but you have to grin and bear it and get on with things
9309024 i remember a short strip in the eagle annual about two boys one of whom was adopted
9309025 it is one of the more unusual things we have had to rescue an animal from
9309026 young cows are quite curious and she probably thought there was some food inside the drum
9309027 most people hate to see fly tipping as it is an ugly blight on the landscape but incidents like these highlight that as well as the visual impact the rubbish can also endanger animals
9309028 the heifer was probably curious to see a new item dumped in the field and curiosity would have turned to panic once she got her head stuck in the drum and was unable to get it out
9309029 if people disposed of their rubbish properly many animals would be saved from injury and death

9309052 i knew i had to rest on friday but i woke at 2am did not get back to
9309053 yes its not much but at least they have their land on which they have generated a livelihood for hundred of years without that they are nothing
9309054 they are not desperate for mining in the area as the minister would have us believe
9309055 they are not asking for their lives to be turned upside down their homes smashed their environment degraded but the mining legislation as it stands gives them no protection against this its expropriation without agreement without consultation without compensation
9309056 being promoted as an expropriation and exploitation of natural mineral resources in the national interest and for the benefit of local communities
9309057 but in reality its profit driven exploitation for the benefit of a private corporation and their shareholders in this case foreigners
9309058 there is a man called richard spoor who has divided the community
9309059 he is a white person today spoor says he is fighting for peoples rights but where was he when joe slovo former south african communist party leader was fighting for peoples rights and was imprisoned for that
9309060 how much does he get for dividing our community what is his agenda for not wanting progress
9309061 awarding mining rights without the agreement of the people who stand to lose their customary rights to their land is clearly unconstitutional
9309062 these corporations dress themselves up as caring entities in applying for a licence pretend they have empathy make a big noise about what they intend to do for communities but deliver little
9309063 and at the end of the day a corporation does not function like a person its incapable of compassion they have no philanthropic interests or function beyond maximising profits when they pretend to be concerned they are fundamentally dishonest
9309064 complete cockeyed nonsense cobbled together to bring in as many people as possible under the guise that they have a stake
9309065 its a superficial structure completely unworkable probably one of the worst examples ive seen of black economic empowerment it will deliver nothing its really a farcical effort to convince the world they are doing something wonderful for this community
9309066 the mining companies work quite deliberately to co opt local leadership identify leaders bring them on to their side and start paying them for their work to gain community support
9309067 at the same time they punish those opposed to mining challenge their integrity publicly undermine them or simply refuse to engage with them so you have this double strategy at play co opt and subvert
9309068 and its easy to win support of a small clique of self interested people local politicians businessmen and community leaders who get promised benefits of mining who see an opportunity to enrich themselves or to score votes
9309069 theres a fundamental clash of rights here that seriously needs to be addressed
9309070 we assume there were four attackers and one of them was killed
9309071 our team is working 24 hours trying to catch the three and we are confident that we will make a breakthrough
9309072 he was very brave and dedicated to his job and he would often ignore these threats we knew that he was in a dangerous line of work but we didnt expect his death it is shocking
9309073 it certainly looks like he was killed for his work it is common knowledge that police have links to taxi violence especially in kwamaphumulo kwadukuza
9309074 remember those guns which were stolen from kwamaphumulo police station were linked to local taxi violence the person who took them knew exactly where they were kept
9309075 motlanthe continues to play like a paragon of political correctness who is beyond reproach he behaves as if zuma is no more and can be solely represented by motlanthe with unmandated attacks on the anc youth league
9309076 we are waiting patiently to understand the intentions and agenda of the deputy president on attacking the league in the media
9309077 weve lost him motlanthe to mbeki and his cabinet hes now with them their plan is that jz is jailed then motlanthe becomes president
9309078 things are bad here check what will happen within a month

9309085 whether they are going to threaten microsoft much less google
9309086 ten years ago next month in an innocuous suburban garage page and brin two geeky students at stanford university founded a company called google they would go on to create what is regularly voted the worlds top brand earn accolades as the worlds best employers and become billionaires many times over they would also say their critics cut a swathe through the laws of copyright threaten to devour media like a digital murdoch and harvest more of our secrets than any totalitarian government smashing the core certainties of advertising executives book publishers newspaper owners television moguls and civil libertarians
9309087 so while the internet has truly democratised information and levelled the playing field of access it has yet to liberate the one constant that has driven media services for the last century the need to pay for it more than ever advertising is the fuel that is driving the information economy with the millions of web sites large and small relying on advertising to pay their way unlike the traditional media though one of the true benefits of the online model is that consumers are now enjoying much more tailored and immediate experiences with greater relevance than offline media
9309088 in the information age you would think there would be no more important part of the constitution than the first amendment after all free speech guarantees should have a great deal to do with a knowledge economy and a world in which wealth and power increasingly depend on information technology intellectual property and control over information flows for some time now i have been thinking about how our understandings of the first amendment are likely to change in a digital age gradually i have come to the conclusion that we face a transition of enormous irony at the very moment that our economic and social lives are increasingly dominated by information technology and information flows the first amendment seems increasingly irrelevant to the key free speech battles of the future or more precisely the judge made doctrines that i teach in my first amendment classes seem increasingly irrelevant
9309089 ideas about privacy and the need to protect it have changed radically in recent years
9309090 i dont fault myspace for this travesty so much as i fault the commission for lack of imagination and courage recall that at least the myspace mtv forums during the primaries included real time feedback from viewers that the audience could see and the candidates even saw the aggregated responses in real time also recall that google youtube and the city of new orleans have been offering their services for a and surely something creative could have come of that what theyre offering us here is little more than live video streaming which is like so year 2000
9309091 macquarie university has joined the small club of australian institutions that require academics to make their research papers freely available over the internet in 2004 the queensland university of technology became the first australian institution to usher in a mandatory open access policy charles sturt university followed suit last january
9309092 increasingly print journalism is struggling as advertising dollars move to the internet subscriptions decrease and newspapers find themselves competing with their own websites which offer much of the same content the print editions do free of charge as well as other websites and blogs ironically too one common way in which newspapers have responded to money pressures is to make cuts in newsroom staff and thus to decrease their comparative advantage vis vis bloggers when it comes to offering high quality content as a result it is now quite easy to imagine a near future world in which print newspapers do not exist at all in this column ill focus on one aspect of this important trend the way in which it will likely alter the legal landscape regarding defamation and in turn affect free speech some media companies choose to profit from pirated youtube clips youtube as a threat some major media companies are having a change of heart treating it instead as an advertising opportunity so far the money is minimal ads appear on only a fraction of youtubes millions of videos but the move suggests a possible thaw in the chilly standoff between the online video giant and media companies getting into the good graces of media entities is seen as critical to the future of youtube which has struggled to show appreciable revenue for video ads
9309093 cyberbullying is a relatively new phenomenon as is social networking it is therefore not surprising that there have been relatively few prosecutions in this area the statute does not threaten to criminalize widespread conduct because the government must show that defendant acted with the requisite criminal scienter there is no risk of criminalizing innocent let alone negligent behavior

9309110 the party seeks power entirely for its own sake we are not interested in the good of others we are interested solely in power not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness only power pure power what pure power means you will understand presently we are different from all the oligarchies of the past in that we know what we are doing all the others even those who resembled ourselves were cowards and hypocrites the german nazis and the russian communists came very close to us in their methods but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives they pretended perhaps they even believed that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal we are not like that we know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it power is not a means it is an end one does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship the object of persecution is persecution the object of torture is torture the object of power is power

9309181 im hearing mixed results we were doing really quite well based on feedback going into memorial day and bookings were strong but the floods hit in june and that didnt help many destinations there was a perception that hurt the whole state where people figured we were closed for business so we did some marketing in july when we dont usually do it that got things going again

9309206 i never would have dreamed that people in poland actually cared about what i do so much
9309207 i was young and didnt listen well id like to think im wiser now the wimbledon win her fifth big w helped me a lot to change my mentality to realize not everything had to be perfect all the time if i dont have a perfect practice i know i can play and dont really get upset about the whole tournament i think that helps me relax and had a lot to do with playing well at wimbledon
9309208 id much rather share that doubles gold medal triumph with my sister than anything else
9309209 as people started talking about the new hurricane i was thinking this cant be happening again
9309210 we already lived through this i dont know if we can do this again
9309211 they are concerned about that kind of destruction happening again and how it might postpone graduation or affect their careers down the line
9309212 so im kind of just waiting for it to do what it has to do so i can get back to school
9309213 the nation of islam would not be the nation of islam without jabir muhammad
9309214 it was a fascinating meeting and ended with the honorable elijah muhammad saying you know we should get together more like this to keep them guessing even if we dont do anything but eat chicken
9309215 his job was to get the best deal for his fighter at the least risk and he did
9309216 herbert muhammad has to go down in history as one of the greatest athletic managers
9309217 he told them you might not know who my father is they backed off
9309218 we have now got one permission from the ministry and are waiting for another one after that we would start construction
9309219 we know the national museum has been waiting for long for us to move we will move after the building is completed it will take at least two years
9309220 we want to have construction under the ground this will allow us to have more space and would ensure that there would not be any structural changes that would mar the original design
9309221 es war ein erstklassiges spiel jena war der bis jetzt st rkste gegner gegen den wir gespielt haben dennoch denke ich dass wir verdient gewonnen haben
9309222 sagte fcb coach hermann gerland zum sieg seiner noch jungen truppe gegen jena bei denen bungsleiter henning b rger immer mehr zum ziel der kritiker wird
9309223 sagte kapit n tomasz kos nach der schlappe gegen paderborn
9309224 sagte der entt uschte hasenh ttel wacker konnte dagegen den h chsten sieg seit mai 2007
9309225 beurteilte coach stefan minkwitz die leistung seiner truppe dennoch weilen die schwaben weiter am tabellenende
9309226 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9309227 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9309228 you can have all the pomp and circumstance and greco roman temples that denver will allow but at the end of the day it doesnt mean the american people will believe their lives will get better
9309229 from day one we always knew that our convention would be about issues and their convention would be about barack obama as a celebrity
9309230 everyone recognizes its a game changer john mccain was coming up in the polls before palin and there was energy before this pick but this just shifted it into overdrive
9309231 what karl rove did in 2004 to turn out the social conservative vote was two years in the making theres only 67 days left until the election theres not enough time to do that
9309232 gov palin is very easy to like and she tries to reach out across the aisle on some bipartisan issues
9309233 clearly palin was chosen in hopes of attracting women voters
9309234 there is virtually no other explanation for picking a right wing leader of a state with a population of fewer than 630 000 people which suggests that mccain has such a low opinion of women voters that they would overlook education abortion foreign policy civil rights health care family leave and more simply to vote for a candidate with two x chromosomes
9309235 the democratic convention was four consecutive days of headlines focused on division within the party between clinton and obama
9309236 we know that barack obama failed to unify the democratic party and that has created opportunities for our team
9309237 she is supposed to be this great woman and she seems like she has a lot of hatred toward the country
9309238 theyre pro life and for the death penalty how can that be
9309239 hes going to be operated on as its a clean break of his femur i understand a clean break is better than a partial break
9309240 it is a shame but thats the nature of the sport it is dangerous and unfortunately its our name thats come out of the hat this time
9309241 the bill for giving constitutional status to national commission for minorities ncm is hanging since 2004 for this reason and in view of the sensibilities involved in it nobody wants to put their hand in it
9309242 by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god
9309243 you know the grace of our lord jesus christ that though he was rich yet for your sakes he became poor that you through his poverty might become rich
9309244 the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart from a good conscience and sincere faith
9309245 that christ may dwell in your hearts by faith you being rooted and grounded in love
9309246 this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance that christ jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom i am chief
9309247 the president is highly unpopular there doesnt seem to be much excitement around the candidate and theres a real fear of being tagged with the republican label and being seen with george bush
9309248 if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
9309249 her husband was distraught about the divorce and wanting to reconcile but that she was insisting on the divorce
9309250 remove the nakba from the education system and restore jabotinsky
9309251 the last mathematics olympics even iran beat us its a matter of national strength and national security and it is a realistic goal to restore israels children to the top ten in the world within a decade
9309252 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
9309253 sarah palin will make history as a vice presidential candidate and not simply because she is a woman but because shes a woman of substance and character
9309254 we know from recent voting patterns that women are the key voting group that will elect the next president of the united states
9309255 so it is vitally important that republican women get involved you cant win this election without the womens vote
9309256 makes clear that john mccain is completely out of touch on the issues that matter to american women
9309257 the last thing women need is a president and vice president who are prepared to turn back the clock on womens rights and repeal the protections of roe v wade
9309258 women voters are electrified and sarah is someone who is truly in sync with the way real american women think
9309259 she is a reform minded woman who will give all americans born and unborn the authentic leadership they deserve
9309260 we are having a meeting right now to assess the peace talks with the philippine government the peace talks are now in purgatory
9309261 this is a long process and the milf leadership will talk about the future of the peace talks with the arroyo government
9309262 we will not sign the memorandum of agreement on the ancestral domain but will continue with further negotiations with the milf to arrive at final peace deal
9309263 it is already a done deal and we have been saying this all the time we will not revisit or renegotiate the agreement on the ancestral domain
9309264 we are waiting for the formal communication that the ancestral domain deal has been scrapped so we can decide on what steps to take whether to continue the peace talks or not
9309265 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9309266 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9309267 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9309268 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9309269 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9309270 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9309271 in a move that reeks of desperate hail mary strategizing and to my mind grossly overestimates the potential puma vote in this country john mccain chooses alaska governor sarah palin a woman hed barely spoken to before yesterday
9309272 palin has helped mccain among republicans left democrats unfazed but moved the
9309273 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9309274 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9309275 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9309276 these welcome signs indicate that the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect
9309277 the growth package will return more than 150 billion back to american families and businesses this year
9309278 lifting the ban on offshore drilling and implementing long term tax credits to spur the development of alternative sources of energy
9309279 in the coming months it will be tempting for some in congress to try to score political points instead of getting work done for the american people we still have time to accomplish important goals for our country
9309280 when it comes to being out of touch with what middle class americans are going through george bush and john mccain are two of a kind
9309281 the economy has lost jobs each of the last seven months and over the past seven and a half years job growth has been weaker than in any economic expansion on record
9309282 inflation reached a 17 year high this month we learned that prices jumped 5 6 percent in july over a year earlier that is the largest year over year increase in inflation since january 1991 when the economy was in recession
9309283 it is going to be a painstaking and lengthy process before the full examination of the house and its surrounds is completed
9309284 in the meantime we will keep an open mind concerning what we may or may not find
9309285 till benazir was alive zardari wasnt much in the limelight in fact they had an unspoken understanding that one of them had to be with the children while they were growing up and it was zardari who became the babysitter
9309286 in that sense the real transformation of zardari has been from playing third fiddle to benazir all his married life to getting all set to be the most powerful civilian president in pakistani history owing to a combination of unfortunate circumstances
9309287 quite simply it is a case of greatness being thrust upon an individual the media especially in pakistan built up zardari as a statesman like figure because the country was as desperate to taste democracy as he was eager to taste power
9309288 make no mistake zardari is an extremely astute politician who plays his cards close to his chest the poker face replaced by a perennial but deadly smile he has displayed innate political cunning to sweep aside challengers in and outside the party he will stoop to conquer if necessary
9309289 its difficult to trust him since he has gone back on his words so many times
9309290 as for his supposed transformation probably he has gone for an image makeover there have been rumours that a british pr firm has been grooming him
9309291 of course he has got rid of his rather threatening handlebar moustache which would have been quite inappropriate in the circumstances and replaced it with an ashen and nondescript caterpillar across the upper lip which has just the opposite disarming impact
9309292 if the waiver is not acceptable india could well walk away
9309293 it is high time the state government handed over the districts to the army to save the lives of marooned people
9309294 people have lost faith in the state government and patience is running out
9309295 it is high time the state government handed over the districts to the army to save the lives of marooned people
9309296 people have lost faith in the state government and patience is running out
9309297 this is the real deal this is not a test
9309298 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9309299 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9309300 curfew relaxation was withdrawn and re imposed in the area immediately as violent protests erupted
9309301 which would be set aside exclusively for use by the sasb without any change in proprietorship title of the land which would continue to remain with the state forest department
9309302 there is a one line solution everything will be settled if the ancillary units are relocated to the land on the opposite side of the small car unit
9309303 um eine fiktive honorarerh hung von nebul sen zehn prozent f r die niedergelassenen rzte finanzieren zu k nnen
9309304 infam mit einer neuerlichen honorarl ge einen keil zwischen patienten und rzte zu treiben

9309308 der wahre kostentreiber bei den beitragss tzen ist die regierung auch die streichung des tabaksteuer zuschusses in mehrfacher milliardenh he belastet den beitragssatz erheblich
9309309 eher eine u bahn in venedig als den verlust der fl chendeckenden patientenversorgung in den arztpraxen
9309310 si les divisions continuent le ps risque de rentrer dans la confusion politique on a trop souffert de ces divisions pour les entretenir
9309311 il ne faut pas que les militants soient frustr s par ce congr s sil y a plusieurs motions au sein de la majorit du parti ndlr il ny aura pas de majorit et tout se passera en tractations dans les couloirs
9309312 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9309313 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9309314 the west took russia in as a member of the g8 grouping of the most important democratic industrial nations even though it fulfilled neither the economic nor the political requirements
9309315 thus these nations should meet in the old g7 format as long as russia is not prepared to find a solution under the framework of the
9309316 according to these agreements the russians had certain rights on georgian territory
9309317 now the russians have no rights whatsoever on georgian territory their presence here is illegal and they should leave georgia
9309318 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the
9309319 the sarah palin decided to suspend their normal election campaign and visit to inspect preparations for the arrival of gustav
9309320 really i just did not expect this it has been a long time since we have been hit by such a powerful hurricane and this gustav looks like it will be quite strong
9309321 people young and old need to be fully aware of the consequences of their actions no matter how unintentional
9309322 the liberal democrat ams site is fast achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log
9309323 highly readable and in part quite entertaining the website is certainly worth a visit
9309324 a double espresso of dull this is a man who has almost cornered the market in pedestrian prose and who unwittingly mimics the what i had for breakfast blog so beloved of the mainstream media

9309352 there is no longer a case for taking 4 billion a year from the public to produce programmes they do not want or can obtain free elsewhere
9309353 the world has moved on since the days when the bbc was central to british life any modern government that fails to acknowledge this fact is quite simply defying the will of the people
9309354 corporate gigantism and belief in a unique moral mission have made the bbc what it is today and yet both are of vanishingly small concern to viewers and listeners
9309355 the bbc internally is not neutral about multiculturalism it believes in it and promotes diversity lets face up to that
9309356 it must seek respect not for what it is but for what it does
9309357 the bbcs remit is to produce a volume of high quality programmes with much reduced output its long tradition of producing fine programmes and a budget of 4 million a day it should be able to achieve it triumphantly
9309358 the english democrats are offering a fresh start and reject the clich ridden and spin politics of the past we offer the politics of a common national identity and common values our politics are riddled with spin and political correctness a vote for the english democrats is a vote for honest and plain speaking
9309359 there should be an immediate referendum on the eu lisbon treaty it is wholly wrong for labour to try to impose this treaty on us contrary to their own specific manifesto commitment that there should be a referendum the people of the republic of ireland have said no we want our say
9309360 there should be free residential car for the elderly as is available in scotland it is wrong that pensioners homes in england are being seized to pay for this
9309361 we also demand access to all nhs drugs not a
9309362 there should be an end to the unjustified subsidies to other parts of the uk we want a fair system for all
9309363 england can no longer sustain uncontrolled mass immigration it should be stopped it places an unacceptable strain on all our services all previous governments have allowed this situation to get out of control
9309364 the government should seek to protect society and not the criminals
9309365 there should be an english parliament with an english prime minister and government with at least the same powers as the scottish ones
9309366 the voters of haltemprice and howden have the chance to send a clear message to the government and the rest of the stale political establishment that the people of england are no longer prepared to be treated as second class citizens within the uk let us put englands interests first
9309367 i am convinced that standing still is not an option the present arrangements are producing growing resentment all over the united kingdom particularly in england
9309368 a vote for joanne and the english democrats is a positive vote for the people of haltemprice and howden it is a vote for england and for an english parliament first minister and government for england
9309369 i will impress upon them the need to avoid prejudicing the process which we must now undertake in ireland
9309370 accord us the time we need to play our part in understanding last weeks vote
9309371 one of the main goals will be to calm the europeans down and not inflame the situation either in the eu or back at home any further
9309372 it will be made clear to the eu partners that it is politically impossible for ireland to have a rerun
9309373 i think you have excellently designed institutions for the budget process in an independent state or a state with substantial fiscal autonomy
9309374 barnett is unsustainable in the long run it is neither efficient nor equitable
9309375 it gives perverse incentives to the devolved administrations their block grant is a function of a number they cannot control
9309376 in turn their decisions have consequences which the uk government cannot fully control
9309377 it probably derives not from greater need but from the more credible threat to the union of the united kingdom that they pose
9309378 prof mcleans evidence points to one of devolutions fundamental flaws that we are spending money without direct responsibility for raising it
9309379 it is time to look again at how we fund our policy priorities
9309380 we may have to say well look were not happy with this situation here are some of the powers wed like to have back but we cant give you that referendum on the lisbon treaty because its already been put in place across the rest of europe
9309381 mutterings about regime change used to be confined to the fringes of the party but now there is a more widespread view that gordon will have to go unless he can win back public support
9309382 tamsin delivers for crewe and nantwich you told tamsin your concerns she put them directly to the chancellor she stood up for you
9309383 i think you will find he is not the type of lawyer he claims to be
9309384 it would not surprise us if labour was stooping to this level its entire campaign has been marked by mean spirited stunts and dirty tricks
9309385 carter tells anyone who will listen that james is the best thing since sliced bread
9309386 one way of unseating him would be through a war of attrition with relentless carefully placed attacks laying the ground for a delegation of elder statesmen the men in suits
9309387 asked what he would be in another life it would be a salesman car dealer pr guy estate agent and worst of all a foxtons estate agent
9309388 government in the uk is now so large diverse and complex that it is impossible for anyone to manage effectively let alone by ministers with no prior experience of management and little in depth understanding of the work carried out by their departments government today tries to do too much and consequently fails the structure of government needs to change if we hope to see better value and significant improvements in our public services
9309389 do you think that regeneration is adding a new wing to your mansion
9309390 have you and your tory mates on the council been soft on yobs and failed to make our streets safer
9309391 flatters some of the most chauvinistic and backward looking parts of british society
9309392 is a small price to pay for saving the union
9309393 we are worried about the reports of ken drinking too much if we lost london it would be a political disaster and gordon knows that
9309394 in my view ken livingstone would do a better job if he drank less i fear we have an alcohol fuelled mayoralty
9309395 well im concerned about the amount im drinking because its nothing like enough
9309396 the english are awakening to the unfairness of the barnett formula and to the democratic deficit in the way in which we are governed
9309397 come the three corners of the world in arms and we shall shock them nought shall make us rue if england to itself do rest but true
9309398 look if england got its own parliament and the union broke up what would happen to all the scottish people living in england and all the english people living in scotland
9309399 the truth the whole truth and anything but the truth
9309400 in some of the more heavily populated urban areas of the country family life is quite frankly in meltdown or completely unrecognisable
9309401 in some areas of the country even including the more urban parts of the sleepy west in which i operate family life in the old sense no longer exists
9309402 so i suggest the general collapse of ordinary family life because of the breakdown of families in this country is on a scale depth and breadth which few of us could have imagined even a decade ago
9309403 what is certain is that almost all of societys social ills can be traced directly to the collapse of the family life
9309404 most children and young people in england today are safe healthy and achieve well
9309405 the new brownvilles will be the same old projects that developers have been trying to squeeze through planning for ages greenwashed to suit the zeitgeist commuter dormitories with low energy knobs on
9309406 immigration is responsible for at least 70 per cent of the uks projected population increase which will take the uk from 61 million today to 85 million by 2081
9309407 the environmental consequences of such a massive population rise are alarming they include loss of countryside and green space and all the psychological stresses that come with high population densities overcrowding and loss of tranquillity
9309408 the alternative vote has many attractions including the fact that you have to get 50 plus one in that constituency therefore you have a greater legitimacy
9309409 it should not be about parties choosing a system that will most advantage themselves its about a voting system that delivers democracy for all of us
9309410 i dont understand how it can cause offence it is our country after all
9309411 home office policy precludes applications with tattoos on lower arm hand face or neck that are prominent which may cause offence and or invite provocation from the public or colleagues
9309412 a family who arent of english origin who see england on your arm could feel you might discriminate against them
9309413 we live in a diverse society and try to ensure we give everybody equality
9309414 but im now looking at other options like the fire service or prison service
9309415 this tattoo was clearly visible as it does not meet our rigorous standards his application was rejected
9309416 i expect they will want to ensure that the same type of collateral for central bank loans is taken here as it is by the fed and european central bank
9309417 i think the issue here is much more about ensuring that as peaks and troughs hit central banks are prepared to act and provide liquidity if liquidity is required
9309418 the bank of england is very keen to ensure that we have good strong confidence in our market after all weve got good strong banks
9309419 make it clearer what it means to be a citizen
9309420 practical measures that may help enhance a sense of shared belonging
9309421 my report makes a range of proposals that touch every stage of an individuals life my proposals are intended to promote the meaning and significance of citizenship within modern britain
9309422 in terms of a british national day what may be beneficial is a new public holiday to celebration the bond of shared citizenship
9309423 it can be a pledge of commitment to the country it can be a statement of what the rights and responsibilities of citizens are
9309424 we already teach schoolchildren what citizenship means but it would make sense to have a coming of age ceremony which marks the moment they move from being a student of citizenship to being a real citizen in themselves
9309425 a half baked idea that should be left to go mouldy
9309426 i see this as an empty gesture to ask 16 year olds to troop into a hall and like americans put their hands on their heart and take an oath of allegiance is risible
9309427 we dont support it and neither do the vast majority of parents teachers and children in scotland
9309428 there is corruption in any government there is always corruption its bad when it is more than 15 per cent
9309429 the 2008 2009 hotel forecast what does the future hold for the sector
9309430 weve gone from family thats got bills like everyone to wow do we need to call a bankruptcy attorney
9309431 weve known city was in a pinch but where did the money go for the budget from last year
9309432 there is a new collect agency the city just hired and the collection rate is around 80 or 90 percent its going to be good for us but its going to take time
9309433 personally it has put a depression over this house that i havent seen in long long time
9309434 its the same with my sons school were just living were not living above our means
9309435 were working for minimum wage but all the training we have and the blood sweat and tears to do that for minimum wage is a slap in face
9309436 every month i have a nipsco shutoff notice or a water shutoff notice and my car insurance went up everybody is just trying to make it but theres hope as long as there is faith in ones body
9309437 she has faith in god and we believe that god is going to see us through this trying time
9309438 i was paying for child care but i couldnt afford it at 300 a week
9309439 my friends have been a big help with taking care of my boys i have some really good friends
9309440 everything has gone up we cant afford to get our money taken away from us like that
9309441 its very rewarding we have our good days and our bad days we really feel that we dont deserve to be treated this way
9309442 so do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will care for itself each day has enough trouble of its own
9309443 because we just had them and the kids are sick of them
9309444 i cant afford to do take out food every night and its not healthy
9309445 yours taste so great please make it i know its a lot of work but i really want some
9309446 when youre putting wheat on the ground theres going to be a loss
9309447 they dont ever like to put it on the ground but when wheat is 7 8 or 10
9309448 were way way behind in our infrastructure investment both in the private sector and publicly
9309449 and we need to move a lot on that or we will see other countries supplant us as they get greater investment in their infrastructure
9309450 the research only began in the late 1980s early 1990s
9309451 the social world was thought to be too complicated to be studied scientifically but the brain is being sculpted by the demands of the social world its fundamental
9309452 participating in the community walks also raises awareness helps break the cycle of silence and stigma that surrounds the issues of suicide and mental illness
9309453 i often say i wish he would have been here to see the public outpouring
9309454 we do need to have an awareness and prevention program
9309455 make no little plans make big plans aim high in hope and work think big
9309456 youre sweet please come in im almost ready i just have to put on my skirt

9309466 but theres something else youre the first guy ive gone out with who treats me like im something special i like that stevie you put me up on a pedestal you make me feel like im superior you make me feel like a goddess
9309467 stevie most of the guys i know have to be in control they want me to be submissive
9309468 dont get me wrong i absolutely adore being dominated by a hot masculine guy who knows how to take charge
9309469 sometimes i want to be the dominant one sometimes i want to be the one in control stevie you dont seem to mind if i take control i like that i like the fact that youll let me be in control i like the fact that youll let me be the dominant one in our relationship

9309485 oh my i think that this might turn out to be a really kinky evening
9309486 come stevie dear its time for us to go home
9309487 i am appealing for anyone who was in the area at the time of the murder who may have seen or heard something or anyone who has information to please contact police in confidence
9309488 older americans are hit by a one two punch of jobs and medical problems and the two are often intertwined
9309489 they discover that they must work to keep some form of economic balance and when they cant theyre lost
9309490 i paid the bills whether i ate or didnt whether i went to the doctor or not
9309491 id go to bed and all i had on my mind was bankruptcy
9309492 you have to cry and try and figure out what in the world could i do

9309496 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9309497 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9309498 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9309499 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9309500 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly

9309507 it is a community where one native has a polar bear in the living room some have horses in their backyard and almost everyone knows the foo fighters on a first name basis stokkseyri is located on the south coast only 45 minutes from reykjav k this small village of about 500 people is renowned for its natural beauty but more impressive are the creative inhabitants living there inspired by the shore and wildlife in the surrounding area stokkseyri wasnt much of a draw for tourists a decade ago natives almost entirely depended on the fishing industry and the 26 metre high lighthouse knarrar sviti was really the only attraction for travellers times have changed the fish processing moved to nearby town orl ksh fn and with companies like kajakfer ir t fragar urinn restaurant vi fj rubor i and all kinds of museums the village is becoming a popular spot for both locals and foreigners arriving by thousands every year to take part in various activities
9309508 ive heard that from people but really were focusing on trying to make the playoffs
9309509 we have tough series coming up with the phillies and the mets and we have all we can do to just focus on trying to win those series we cant lose sight of what were trying to do at this stage of the game
9309510 i feel better about our team now than i did about them last year at this time
9309511 we started out strong last year and we began to fade this time we started out slow and i think weve had the best record in the majors since may 20 which is when we played the red sox
9309512 i think the year under our belt and having cc has made a big impact not only on the day he pitches but with our entire staff hes a humble guy a quiet leader who really talks about the game all the time and helps out the other pitchers
9309513 set an example for all of our players in terms of how to get physically and mentally prepared for a game
9309514 hes not a vocal guy but the way he goes about his business is very professional hes hit big home runs had big catches big pinch hits
9309515 our starters are going deep in games were asking them to go an extra inning sometimes when that happens your guys in the bullpen go four or five days without working and sometimes the lack of work shows up
9309516 but our focus is on right now what can we do to give us the best chance to win right now well make the offseason decisions in the offseason
9309517 it hasnt been bad you cope the best you can but we didnt do a very good job living up to expectations we didnt score the runs we thought we were going to score with the offense we thought we had we didnt have our rotation intact we thought we were going to have jeremy bonderman and dontrelle willis all year and we didnt we had injuries but thats a part of it everybody has them no excuses we didnt do a good enough job im the manager of the team and ultimately it falls on me
9309518 its not going to be a positive year no matter how we finish thats been blown but it doesnt mean we cant enjoy the competition and play baseball weve got some big games coming up with minnesota and chicago im looking forward to grinding it out the rest of the way and watch our guys go out there and play the game hard and the way its supposed to be played
9309519 we have a lot of good pieces on this team were not a perfect team or else we wouldnt be in the spot in the standings we are now but we do have a lot to work with going forward were going to have to figure some things out it was just one of those years where things just didnt go right but thats happened to a lot of teams it happened to the white sox and they rebounded from it and have done very well so we can rebound from this too
9309520 the angels are a very good team really good tampa bay has good players and theres no doubt in my mind that theyre the real deal theyve done a tremendous job if i had to pick the two surprise teams it would be tampa bay and minnesota the twins have done an amazing job putting that together over there chicago has been a good team all year and boston is loaded
9309521 hes a guy who had major surgery and is coming back and i just went over to toledo to watch him throw i was just looking to watch his delivery and to see if he was free and easy and he was hes free after this so im not sure how were going to approach it for next year just yet
9309522 theres no doubt some team is going to throw a zillion dollars at him
9309523 if they do how can you blame them hes been one of the premier guys for a long time
9309524 i think you always worry about durability over the long haul but id be surprised if the angels didnt re up
9309525 i am happy with the decision theres already enough second guessing in this game im not going to second guess my decision there were a lot of issues with contracts and playing time
9309526 i had paul show me his grip and i was able to pull the ball out of his hands
9309527 and then i showed him how i gripped it and he wasnt able to pull it out of mine i told him that my grip on my curveball was similar to my fastball and i noticed when i saw him throw a side session that his arm was dragging on the curveball maybe a little lazy on the arm speed i suggested he speed that up and grip the ball harder and it looks like its helped him hes a great guy very smart pitcher that was a great pickup for boston
9309528 to me its about how disheartening it is for everybody in the organization the players coaches and front office to not see the excitement funnel its way into tropicana field
9309529 the tv ratings are high and thats a great sign but it hasnt translated to the number of people at tropicana field it really takes the wind out of our sails
9309530 the rangers pirates indians rockies orioles and tigers have completed the most dps and none are postseason contenders on the other hand the cubs mets marlins and diamondbacks have the fewest double plays and are all battling to play in october the giants have set a franchise record with 15 rookies making their debuts one more than the 1926 new york giants its the most in the majors since the 1954 athletics who also had 15
9309531 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9309532 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9309533 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9309534 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9309535 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me
9309536 im on vacation i dont got nothing to lose i got one more month left you know go to the house relax and see what my situation is going to be

9309539 the risk of further nuclear proliferation is imminent and with it the danger that nuclear war fighting albeit limited in scope might become possible
9309540 the first use of nuclear weapons must remain in the quiver of escalation as the ultimate instrument to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction
9309541 immediate action is needed to protect large numbers of human beings
9309542 nato is at a juncture and runs the risk of failure
9309543 the time has come for germany to decide if it wants to be a reliable partner
9309544 this report means that the core of the nato establishment is saying were in trouble that the west is adrift and not facing up to the challenges
9309545 to tie our hands on first use or no first use removes a huge plank of deterrence
9309546 maybe we are going to use nuclear weapons before anyone else but id be wary of saying it out loud
9309547 rethink its nuclear posture because the nuclear non proliferation regime is under enormous pressure
9309548 proliferation is spreading and we have not too many options to stop it we dont know how to deal with this

9309599 we have got a specially adapted treadmill that is linked in to a virtual reality system so a little bit like a computer game
9309600 the particularly interesting aspect in terms of the research we are doing here is that we have found that it we manipulate the virtual reality so that people think they are moving slower than they are what happens is that they move faster and better
9309601 they do not realise they are putting any more effort in and they are not feeling any more pain in fact they are less anxious than normal
9309602 they have a better quality of walking so it has huge implications for recovery
9309603 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it
9309604 when like andy people walk with a stick they automatically lean to one side
9309605 this treadmill keeps them upright and enables them to adjust their balance better
9309606 because it is a virtual reality andy can see things on the screen as he is walking along so he is not conscious how slow or fast he is going as his mind is occupied
9309607 on a normal treadmill you have nowhere to look but your feet and that is where people lose their balance
9309608 if he can get to use it on a regular basis he will make great strides
9309609 if this was available maybe three or four years ago he might not be walking with a stick now

9309621 after one year at ramkhamhaeng university faculty of law i was quite certain that i did not have the discipline and courage to finish the degree so i applied and got a place at kasetsart university which specialises in forestry and conservationist studies
9309622 saksit is a dedicated researcher and he learned on the field work from not only me but sueb nakasathien and other foresters we need this type of person who cares for the vanishing specie
9309623 sometimes we have to confront poachers and other forms of encroachers
9309624 we are counting tigers but it is more important to foresee the trends than to know the exact number of the present tiger population
9309625 the forest and surrounding areas need to be left untouched or less touched by humans
9309626 we need to explain and provide scientific proof that preserving wildlife has an economic justification for society we might fail to educate the public on this therefore people are easily touched by the beauty of forest but their consideration stops there they think the forest is already perfect they dont know that in order for there to be a forest there must be wild animals and other forms of fragile natural life
9309627 we should quickly declare more protected areas and sanctuaries to save as much space as possible for tigers we also have to manage the sanctuaries to try to reduce human tiger conflicts
9309628 we should grasp that improving tiger density means improving the shape of the forests it means their prey also have a future and in general the food chain and the water table are intact
9309629 weve heightened our surveillance to try and identify any new cases that occur
9309630 even though the product has now been pulled off the shelves of all the stores and weve gone to great lengths to have all the health inspectors across the province follow up on particularly the high risk institutions to ensure those meat products are not used there we may have another case or two in the next few weeks
9309631 we have established ourselves as a party that cannot be described as fringe we are a party whose ideas and policies are now in the mainstream of the public debate
9309632 at this point it has nothing to do with the liberal party
9309633 it is a private family matter between myself and my wifes stepfather
9309634 its looking more likely than it was before these meetings but the fact that the liberal party is refusing to meet with us is i think a bad sign that they are not interested in cooperating
9309635 when one offers to have a meeting and when one offers to have a phone call and theres no response and no agreement to even do that its hard to imagine how you can have a parliament work when you cant even get agreement to have a conversation
9309636 it is important not to focus on the exact track of gustav as this is a large hurricane and significant impacts are likely to occur well away from the center
9309637 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9309638 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9309639 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9309640 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9309641 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9309642 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9309643 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9309644 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9309645 the conditions are not conducive for resuming work at the tata motors small car factory
9309646 six japanese experts working in the plant have left because of the uncertainty
9309647 hab einen elfmeter nicht gekriegt ein tor gemacht mich dann vom platz geschleppt
9309648 aber wichtig ist dass wir heute bis zum schluss gek mpft haben
9309649 matzes nachbarin liselotte unterstellt ihm dass er sie im dunklen hausflur berfallen und ausgeraubt hat
9309650 hannah hat einen furchtbaren verdacht sie glaubt dass ihre tochter von ihrem lehrer missbraucht wird
9309651 sophia bringt ihr neugeborenes heimlich bei einer tagesmutter unter um ohne das wissen ihres mannes arbeiten zu gehen
9309652 haben sie denn schon erfahrungen was streicheln anbetrifft was petting anbetrifft oder geht sie gleich von null auf hundert
9309653 man kann den andern nicht ndern aber man kann sich selbst ndern
9309654 wissen sie was ich glaube sie haben sich lange zusammengerissen
9309655 dass man vor gericht die wahrheit sagen muss wissen sie wenn sie das nicht tun machen sie sich strafbar
9309656 das interessiert nicht und das ist auch nicht ihre zust ndigkeit
9309657 das ist hm inhaltlich richtig formal ist es ein problem
9309658 tell them about your dream martin tell them about the dream
9309659 jackie parker was a great player and 40 yards was about his limit
9309660 he hit it well it hit the crossbar and then it hung there for a second then it fell into the endzone the labour day game continued from there they may have played before then but it really got going then
9309661 when i was making the schedule i would tell them i wanted labour day and we preferred edmonton
9309662 when we played toronto that year there was a lot of public outcry as to why we werent playing the eskimos
9309663 they would ask us what day we could play home games
9309664 we couldnt play on thursday nights because that was shopping night you couldnt do anything on sunday either
9309665 you cant have two pro teams in one province and not have a rivalry
9309666 its the same thing with toronto and hamilton it was always a great game back in the 1960s
9309667 for several years in the 60s we played back up there on thanksgiving
9309668 it was logical for us to play here on labour day and to play back there on thanksgiving it didnt happen every year either we would always ask and some years edmonton wouldnt play there was times when edmonton got themselves all knotted up and wouldnt play on labour day when they made the schedule
9309669 it was good scheduling and a good weekend especially with the fact the clubs were competitive and there is a natural rivalry between the two cities
9309670 the dang ball hit the crossbar almost wobbled whether it was going to go into the field or the endzone
9309671 im excited about going to tampa my no 1 priority was to stay with ottawa but it didnt work out and now i have to get ready for a new challenge
9309672 the money just wasnt going to work there i understand the business and the way things go
9309673 the senators were the team i wanted to be with when this started but it just wasnt going to work
9309674 they were the team that drafted me and i wanted to stay there they decided to go in a different direction they got good players in kuba and picard those guys are good defencemen who are going to help them
9309675 schubert was surprised were going to miss each other but well definitely get a chance to see each other when the two teams play each other
9309676 the acquisition and signing of andrej is a strong statement to our players and our fans that the lightning ownership group is committed to putting the best product on the ice now and for years to come
9309677 andrej will be a very big part of our hockey club moving forward at 22 years of age he will only continue to improve and mature as a player
9309678 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9309679 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9309680 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9309681 einen punkt eine linie das konventionellste und unkonventionellste symbol um zu sagen was er sagen will
9309682 we have not made a decision for any sort of mass evacuations
9309683 were trying not to pull the trigger too quickly on evacuations
9309684 there may be some shifting in the direction of the storm
9309685 make sure you can take care of yourselves for two or three days
9309686 i want to bring home to world leaders on this expedition the reality of what is now happening here in the arctic the rate of change is clearly faster than nearly all the models predict which has huge implications for and how to tackle it
9309687 we covered just under 13 6 miles saw lots of puffins along the way
9309688 the weather continues to be good to us although it is nearly september the sea is relatively calm and we made good progress
9309689 i appreciate my fellow officers doing all that they did for me
9309690 it arroyo city is like every place any more you have to lock your doors and stuff
9309691 once in a while a rod would walk off a dock or something like that but nothing major

9309712 between last sunday and today we have not had any encounters with militant groups in any part of the niger delta

9309714 we need a leader a guide someone to make our dreams happen tomorrow its a mission we have entrusted him with
9309715 ich m chte mich in bescheidener weise bei der gesellschaft f r mein verbrechen entschuldigen
9309716 es geht um ungef hr eine halbe million minuten pro monat
9309717 im begging you whatever she says do not react we cant afford to lose our captain before the season has even started
9309718 and i really dont feel up to the job of captaining us against slytherin
9309719 forget anything that you have learnt before today in your lessons with professor burbage since recent ministry investigations have found her teaching to be inaccurate to say that muggles and muggle borns have equal status with those born of noble descent is a lie at best
9309720 cleaning the blood is not a new idea muggles and muggle borns have tried to remove wizards from society since carthage was destroyed by rome in 149 bc by their calendar the most recent examples have been in germany in the 1940s congo in the 1960s and it is still taking place in serbia this has been disguised as something known as ethnic cleansing over the course of this year we will be looking at ways to fight back against those of inferior blood status and how britain is in desperate need of cleaning so we can keep our fine traditions and noble history
9309721 and what makes matters worse some of our kind allow these mudbloods into our noble world and then pollute the blood further by reproducing with them not only should witches and wizards be aware of their birthright but we should not allow their polluted and inferior linage into society a perfect example is shown with the noble and long standing potter family when james potter married a mudblood and produced undesirable number one the runt of the wizarding world and murderer of albus dumbledore
9309722 i would not want to have to use some of those curses that you have just claimed that i have used before
9309723 good girl now place it on the table and stand outside the door i will not have lies in my classroom
9309724 i offered to teach you about your birthright and save you from your second detention of the day
9309725 now as long as you do as i say meta name
9309726 now go back in there act shaken and dont tell anyone about this
9309727 and ginny im not going to help you out again you are a gryffindor blood traitor no matter how hot you are
9309728 dark arts for a double and then muggle studies for a double
9309729 and one lesson on how to be a good pure blood
9309730 fancy keeping watch while i practice my handwriting on some walls
9309731 how would you feel about getting an honorary big brother
9309732 well for my first role as big brother im going to say that if you want to show off your fine handwriting skills
9309733 but you know its obvious its your handwriting we should write in capitals next time
9309734 they cant take much more from me than whats already been taken and they really cant hurt me more
9309735 dont give up already ginny they wouldnt want that and im pretty sure that they want you back in one piece
9309736 sure ive got a free period now and have yet to get homework
9309737 ill trade you your monday for mine the carrows have both given essays
9309738 and ive still got a double of potions for slughorn before the day is over
9309739 i guess i was right about getting a ravenclaw on the case
9309740 so anyone can send messages on these coins to each other now
9309741 i did consider using the free period to write to hermione granger but since she is currently unavailable and was not certain where to dispatch the owl to
9309742 i thought that it would be rather useful to be able to communicate with those here at hogwarts
9309743 we could really make this work we could really fight them
9309744 i have two of the most talented and beautiful sixth years working with me
9309745 lets just make sure that this school is here for harry ron and hermione to come back to
9309746 you have found your soul mate and soul mates are still there after the rain has washed away the blood of battle
9309747 hermione is not going to miss taking her newts ron hes as stubborn as anything ive ever known and he wont let the death eaters get the better of him and harry well if you ask me and i know nothing about the opposite sex in this field but i reckon that he loves you
9309748 please make yourself comfortable i know i will be doing so
9309749 unfortunately you earned your detention so quickly that none of the other students are ready to practise the cruciatus curse
9309750 however madam under secretary umbridge has very kindly lent me this wonderful quill and suggested i reminded you of your blood status i wish you to write the word pureblood until i tell you to stop
9309751 is just the latest hot track from the talented solo artists who the ladies probably scream the most about you know what im talkin about here so dont deny it

9309945 consistently with the practice direction the father being a litigant in person her honour judge bevington on 30 may 2007 had directed that the mothers solicitors were to prepare and lodge a consolidated and paginated bundle in accordance with the presidents practice direction of 27 july 2006 see 2006 2 flr 199 the bundle as prepared by them was lamentably deficient there was no reading list the chronology was virtually useless it omitted many relevant events and was not cross referenced to the bundle the mothers skeleton argument was missing from the bundle most of the key documents having originally been exhibited to various affidavits were scattered through the bundle in neither chronological nor thematic order the index to the bundle was virtually useless as it did not condescend to list the various documents contained in the various exhibits the consequence was that any kind of sustained pre reading of the bundle and in particular of the key documents was virtually impossible there was no excuse for any of this the explanations given in answer to my questions and criticisms were wholly unsatisfactory difficulties with public funding provided no excuse they had been overcome i was told on 13 july 2007 the solicitors responsible for this deplorable state of affairs ought to know better they are experienced family solicitors whose notepaper is festooned with the logos of virtually every relevant family law professional body or association it is now over seven years since the practice direction in its original form was first promulgated the practice direction in its present form was published a year ago it is simply not good enough endless complaints by the judges of the division seem to have had strikingly little effect enough is enough in future those guilty of comparable failings should expect to be publicly identified perhaps public naming and shaming will succeed where judicial exhortation has so conspicuously failed
