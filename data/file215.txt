2150114 tighter curls should be left longer in the summer because youre counting on the weight and length of the hair to loosen the curls and pull them down
2150115 in the summertime theres a lot more bounce to looser curls because the s formation of the curl is tighter

2150255 hendaknya kita mengukur ilmu bukan dari tumpukan buku yang kita habiskan bukan dari tumpukan naskah yang kita hasilkan bukan juga dari penatnya mulut dalam diskusi tak putus yang kita jalani tapi dari amal yang keluar dari setiap desah nafas kita
2150256 seorang hamba doanya akan senantiasa dikabulkan selama tidak berdoa untuk perbuatan dosa atau memutuskan silaturahim serta selama tidak tergesa gesa

2150258 jika allah menahan pemberian nya padamu maka pahamilah bahwa itu adalah suatu kemuliaan untukmu selama kau pertahankan keislaman dan keimananmu higga segenap apa yang dilakukan allah kepada dirimu menjadi karunia pula kepadamu

2150260 pukullah anak anakmu karena meninggalkan shalat pada usia sepuluh tahun dan pisahkan tempat tidur mereka lelaki dan perempuan pada usia sembilan tahun dan kawinkanlah pada usia tujuh belas tahun jika memungkinkan
2150261 niat untuk selalu tampak indah dan menarik adalah suatu kewajaran namun allah maha mengetahui apa apa yang melintas di hati kita apabila niat kita tergelincir ke dalam kemaksiatan dan kesia siaan bisa jadi allah akan memberikan jalan terbukanya bencana bagi kita oleh karenanya bersungguh sungguhlah berniat hanya untuk menggapai ridha allah
2150262 ajal ada saatnya kesulitan bukan berarti harus kita sikapi dengan putus asa pastikan kita bisa mengenal diri dengan lebih baik mengenal diri dengan lebih baik mengenal kemampuan lebih maksimal jangan melakukan sesuatu tanpa tahu ilmu tanpa tahu kebenaran karena bisa jadi bumerang tidak usah memaksakan diri agar kelihatan lebih dari kenyataan yang sebenarnya

2150295 the faubourg saint antoine in this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic roofs there also exist rare and ardent minds it is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to have extremes meet the faubourg saint antoine had also other causes to tremble for it received the counter shock of commercial crises of failures strikes slack seasons all inherent to great political disturbances in times of revolution misery is both cause and effect the blow which it deals rebounds upon it this population full of proud virtue capable to the highest degree of latent heat always ready to fly to arms prompt to explode irritated deep undermined seemed to be only awaiting the fall of a spark whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by the wind of events it is impossible not to think of the faubourg saint antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very gates of paris that powder house of suffering and ideas the wine shops of the faubourg antoine which have been more than once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused possess historical notoriety in troublous times people grow intoxicated there more on words than on wine a sort of prophetic spirit and an afflatus of the future circulates there swelling hearts and enlarging souls the cabarets of the faubourg saint antoine resemble those taverns of mont aventine erected on the cave of the sibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath taverns where the tables were almost tripods and where was drunk what ennius calls the sibylline wine the faubourg saint antoine is a reservoir of people revolutionary agitations create fissures there through which trickles the popular sovereignty this sovereignty may do evil it can be mistaken like any other but even when led astray it remains great we may say of it as of the blind cyclops ingens in 93 when these bristling men who in the early days of the revolutionary chaos tattered howling wild with uplifted bludgeon pike on high hurled themselves upon ancient paris in an uproar what did they want they wanted an end to oppression an end to tyranny an end to the sword work for men instruction for the child social sweetness for the woman liberty equality fraternity bread for all the idea for all the edenizing of the world progress and that holy sweet and good thing progress they claimed in terrible wise driven to extremities as they were half naked club in fist a roar in their mouths they were savages yes but the savages of civilization they proclaimed right furiously they demanded light with the mask of night facing these men who were ferocious we admit and terrifying but ferocious and terrifying for good ends there are other men smiling embroidered gilded beribboned starred in silk stockings in white plumes in yellow gloves in varnished shoes who with their elbows on a velvet table beside a marble chimney piece insist gently on demeanor and the preservation of the past of the middle ages of divine right of fanaticism of innocence of slavery of the death penalty of war glorifying in low tones and with politeness the sword the stake and the scaffold for our part if we were forced to make a choice between the barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism we should choose the barbarians
2150296 in the sermon just minutes before his death archbishop romero reminded his congregation of the parable of the wheat
2150297 those who surrender to the service of the poor through love of christ will live like the grains of wheat that dies it only apparently dies if it were not to die it would remain a solitary grain the harvest comes because of the grain that dies we know that every effort to improve society above all when society is so full of injustice and sin is an effort that god blesses that god wants that god demands of us
2150298 a church that suffers no persecution but enjoys the privileges and support of the things of the earth beware is not the true church of jesus christ a preaching that does not point out sin is not the preaching of the gospel a preaching that makes sinners feel good so that they are secured in their sinful state betrays the gospels call

2150300 when the son of man comes in his glory and all the angels with him he will sit on his throne in heavenly glory
2150301 then the king will say to those on his right come you who are blessed by my father take your inheritance the kingdom prepared for you since the creation of the world
2150302 then the righteous will answer him lord when did we see you hungry and feed you or thirsty and give you something to drink 38when did we see you a stranger and invite you in or needing clothes and clothe you when did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you
2150303 the king will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine you did for me
2150304 then he will say to those on his left depart from me you who are cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels
2150305 they also will answer lord when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or needing clothes or sick or in prison and did not help you
2150306 he will reply i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
2150307 then they will go away to eternal punishment but the righteous to eternal life
2150308 the spirit of the lord is on me because he has anointed me to preach good news to the poor he has sent me to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind to release the oppressed to proclaim the year of the lords favor
2150309 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal
2150310 but there is something that i must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice in the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force
2150311 there are those who are asking the devotees of the dignity of humanity

2150482 statement by robert greenstein reported stimulus package would provide little immediate boost due to removal of most effective provisions 1 24 08 from th ecenter on budget and policy priorities
2150483 would cause states to lose at least 4 billion in state revenue due to linkages between federal and state tax codes
2150484 many states will have to enact deeper and more painful budget cuts likely hitting areas from health care and education to aid to local governments which will act as a drag on the economy
2150485 in the bipartisan negotiations over the stimulus package an appropriate trade would have been to include the sizable but not especially effective business tax cuts in return for a rebate that extended to the working poor but not to drop the unemployment insurance and food stamp provisions it is unfortunate that those two provisions the most targeted and effective measures under consideration were removed and that states facing deficits will be driven deeper into deficit and thus have to cut services or raise taxes more rather than being provided some fiscal relief

2150527 kalau jemaatnya banyak yang kekurangan tentu saja mereka tidak bisa memberi apaapa ujarnya
2150528 syalom ini berpendapat kesejahteraan pendeta itu juga disebabkan oleh tiga faktor yaitu berkat tuhan didukung jemaat dan harus memiliki talenta khusus dalam memimpin jemaat
2150529 kalau untuk di desa ia bisa garap tanah toh tidak setiap hari ia harus menangani jemaatnya sedangkan kalau yang tinggal di kota bisa mempercayakan bisnisnya kepada orang lain katanya
2150530 saya sedih mendengar ada hamba tuhan yang pilihpilih dalam melayani
2150531 saya ngomong begini karena mencintai gereja para hamba tuhan dan tuhan yesus katanya menutup obrolan dengan bahana
2150532 justru yang berada di daerah minus tapi tetap setia melayani itulah pelayanan yang murni kalau ada yang mengatakan begitu saya bertanya balik apa kah dia diberkati tuhan atau tidak
2150533 sederhana tapi setia me layani tidak usah harus miskin juga karena kalau miskin dia mudah sakit bagaimana dia bisa melayani hiduplah sesuai de ngan amanat melayani jangan berpikir bahwa dia akan mendapat imbalan dari jemaat walaupun memang seorang yang bekerja berhak mendapat upahnya
2150534 tetapi dalam memandang kesejahteraan jangan hanya dilihat dari segi materi tetapi juga sukacita
2150535 tuhan tidak menjanjikan kaya tetapi menghendaki kita hidup berkecukupan tambah ekel
2150536 keberadaan organisasi gereja kan salah satunya untuk me ngatasi kesulitan kehidupan pendeta yang dikategorikan kecil
2150537 tidak jarang hamba tuhan dari desa sering dianggap melulu membawa proposal atau list sumbangan atau dengan kata lain dicap mata duitan
2150538 gereja perlu mengadakan program diakonia yang konstan khusus untuk hambahamba tuhan yang kesejahteraannya kurang dengan melakukan program pembapaan
2150539 gerejagereja yang beranggapan bahwa hamba tuhan adalah hamba umumnya memperlakukan pendetanya sebagai hamba artinya apa pun yang diberikan dari denominasi harus diterima secara pasrah berapa pun besarnya
2150540 jemaat atau denominasi perlu menghargai hamba tuhannya dan menjamin kesejahteraan atau kebutuhannya tidak perlu dibiarkan hidup sebagai hamba ujar daniel tegas
2150541 pendapatan pendeta kan disesuaikan dengan jemaat masingmasing tutur ketua komisi wanita gkin torsina surabaya ini
2150542 mungkin dengan ada aturan dari sinode gereja secara keseluruhan jadi bukan satu sinode saja di indonesia ini saya bayangkan alangkah enaknya jika semua gaji hamba tuhan sama tapi standarnya jangan pada standar gaji pendeta di gereja besar jadi hamba tuhan gereja kecil pun makin terpacu dalam pelayanan
2150543 mengisinya karena mereka juga memiliki keluarga yang membutuhkan biaya untuk hi dup
2150544 akhirnya keadaan ini membuat pendeta mencari tambahan penghasilan sehingga konsentrasi terhadap tugas pelayanannya sering terganggu katanya prihatin
2150545 pendeta kota melayani dengan dasi yang mahal dan pakaian bermerk di gedung yang serba lux sementara pendeta desa harus mengelus dada karena atap gereja yang bocor dan berpikir tentang persembahan jemaat yang kecil
2150546 pendeta yang berkecukupan jangan melalaikan kekurangan rekan sekerjanya yang kekurangan
2150547 pendeta dari gereja yang berkelebihan harus membantu pendeta yang berkekurangan dari segi materi pendeta desa memang tidak bisa memberi kecukupan materi kepada pendeta kota tetapi mungkin bisa dengan bentuk pelayanan lain misalnya doa jika masingmasing sadar nama tuhanlah yang ditinggikan
2150548 mereka mengalami kesulitan untuk membiayai pendidikan anakanaknya karena penghasilan mereka hanya cukup untuk kebutuhan seharihari saja katanya
2150549 pendeta kota yang mendapat lebih banyak berkat harus lebih peduli dan menyalurkannya bagi hambahamba tuhan di desa mungkin tidak hanya memberi uang saja tetapi juga berpikir ke depan bagaimana membangun daerah sarana dan prasarana serta sdm sehingga pendeta desa tidak lagi kesulitan tambahnya
2150550 kehidupan pendeta itu sejahtera karena mereka mencari donatur ke luar kota un tuk membangun gereja dan kesejahteraan mereka
2150551 meskipun begitu majelis daerah atau pusat tidak pernah memberikan bantuan tapi puji tuhan selalu saja ada orang yang tergerak hati untuk membantu kami katanya penuh ucapan syukur

2150637 globalization appeals to advocates of hybridity as diverse as homi bhabha and pieterse because it seems to harmonize the universal and the particular and in the process it seems to open up to a multiplicity of cultural relationships unheard of in the age of empire p 474

2150642 as we cross this major milestone we couldnt be more excited about the future of digital music itunes and the ipod
2150643 as important as any instrument or device ever created for the music industry
2150644 with apples legendary ease of use pioneering features such as integrated pod casting support imix playlist sharing seamless transition with ipod and groundbreaking personal use rights the itunes music store is the best way for mac and pc users to legally discover purchase and download music online
2150645 apples impact with their complete thought of an ipod and itunes will be looked upon as important as any instrument or device ever created for the music industry
2150646 itunes customers have subscribed to more than five million pod casts from the itunes pod cast directory which now features over 6000 free audio programmes making it one of the largest pod cast directories in the world
2150647 our research does not support moral panics about children addicted to computer games or mindless entertainment on television but todays children need to be screen wise as well as book wise they are developing new skills and need support in doing this
2150648 the report has implications which extend beyond broadcasting to education and social policies for the young
2150649 equipping the bedroom with tvs audio and computer equipment represents an ideal compromise in which children are both entertained and kept safe two in every three have tvs in their bedroom including half of 6 7 year olds
2150650 the place of books in young peoples lives is changing threatened both by it as a source of information and television as a source of narrative those who have access to a pc are twice as likely to use that as a source of information than turn to a book
2150651 the report also considers some of the differences between social classes and television usage in homes where there are children nearly everyone has a tv and a vcr at home and 4 in 10 have cable and satellite
2150652 on of the biggest issues music industries come across to this day is revenue loss in theory if a person is able to download their favorite music off the internet they would not feel the need to purchase the cd from a store
2150653 the music industry and even some musicians who feel they are taking a loss due to the sharing of their copy protected works online have started fighting back so to speak in recent months there have been more cases of music piracy heading to the courts
2150654 if there are so many lawful issues surrounding the downloading of music you might wonder why we have such in influx of mp3 players cd burners and even that allows users to easily rip music from a cd to their computer the simple answer is that these devices do have a legitimate and legal fair use association
2150655 guarantees itll be easy for unscrupulous players to cheat and thats obviously whats going on here
2150656 the safest course of action is to say we wont certify imports from china because their law wont allow inspections

2150671 other forms of music download programmes such as pressplay and musicnet had not been as successful due to lack of big name artists poor pricing structure and the abscence of that essential
2150672 a year ago if anyone had predicted itunes would sell 70 million songs in a single year we would have been laughed out of town
2150673 consumers tell us they would be prepared to pay a higher price for a piece of music they can play on any player
2150674 we have always argued that the best way to combat illegal traffic is to make legal content available at decent value and convenient
2150675 this is the next big step forward in the digital music revolution the movement to completely interoperable drm free music
2150676 the right thing to do is to tear down walls that precluded interoperability by going drm free and that starts here today
2150677 changes not just the rules of the game but the game itself
2150678 its a reflection that emi is in a more difficult situation than the rest of the record labels they have to gamble
2150679 emi takes lock off music tracks music giants emo is taking software locks off its digital music sold via download sites via itunes
2150680 emi the worlds third biggest record label said every song on its online catalogue will be available in the premium format it said the tracks without locks will cost more and be of higher quality that those it offers now
2150681 i think its only a matter of time before the industry releases all music without any protection

2150687 churring filled the twilight then close at hand came a soft quick call and we saw the silhouettes of a pair of nightjars their long wings rose and fell as they encircled us the reason was a fledgling on the path a few metres ahead its eye gleaming in the torch light the parents circled us even faster like in a playground game clapping their wings as we approached the bird on the path silently flew off

2150707 serbien soll m glichst rasch das kosovo problem im sinne von dessen berwachter unabh ngigkeit l sen
2150708 ein insistieren darauf dass das kosovo ein teil serbiens ist w rde serbien destabilisieren denn dann k nnte die frage der vojvodina die neu in serbien ist ge ffnet werden
2150709 die vojvodina kam 1918 zu serbien und wenn serbien destabilisiert w re k nnte ungarn auf der vojvodina bestehen
2150710 es ist falsch dass das kosovo immer bei serbien gewesen w re denn es wurde erst nach langer zeit 1912 teil serbiens
2150711 wenn der premier serbiens vojislav kostunica darauf besteht dass kosovo ein teil serbien ist dann f hrt das zu stagnation und zu grabenk mpfen die er nicht gewinnen kann
2150712 es wird niemals einen vertrag zwischen serben und albanern geben und darum ist das verlangen nach einer fortsetzung der gespr che nur eine verz gerung der l sung
2150713 eine internationale mission die die erreichten standards im kosovo pr fen w rde k nnte nur feststellen dass die beiden v lker nicht zusammenleben wollen was ja l ngst bekannt ist
2150714 serbien hat binnen 15 monaten gespr chen und in den acht jahren seit seinem verlust der kontrolle ber das kosovo kein konzept f r die reintegration des kosovo vorgelegt die albaner wollen die unabh ngigkeit serbien kann sie nicht integrieren viele leute in serbien sind zufrieden dass die albaner separiert von ihnen leben aber sie verlangen dass die grenzen des kosovo teil der grenzen serbiens sind
2150715 pr sident tadic und seine klugen berater konnten nie erkl ren was die formel mehr als autonomie weniger als souver nit t bedeuten soll
2150716 anstatt auf serbischen grenzen im kosovo zu insistieren w re es besser daran zu arbeiten dass serbien und kosovo in 20 25 jahren in der eu sind
2150717 serbien kann keine kontrolle ber das kosovo aus ben zwei millionen albaner wollen nicht in serbien leben darum ist das kosovo ein sonderfall
2150718 viele in serbien w nschen im kosovo von albanern initiierte unruhen zu sehen um dann sagen zu k nnen sie h tten zu recht die internationale gemeinschaft auf den dort drohenden terrorismus aufmerksam gemacht
2150719 versuch die ffentlichkeit zu betr gen und die schuld auf die medien abzuw lzen
2150720 die politischen f hrer serbiens m ssen die verantwortung ergreifen und m glichst umgehend eine regierung bilden
2150721 seine pers nliche meinung kundgetan keineswegs standpunkte der deutschen regierung und der eu
2150722 ich entschuldige mich ausdr cklich f r die m glicherweise unklaren aussagen und daf r dass der eindruck aufgekommen ist ich h tte ungen gendes verst ndnis f r mein gastland alle gestrigen erkl rungen seien sie wahrheitsgem oder in falscher weise bermittelt worden sind allein mir zuzuschreiben der standpunkt deutschlands und der eu ist bekannt unser ziel sind stabilisierung und frieden auf dem west balkan ich m chte auch nachdr cklich feststellen dass ich in keinen fall die meinung vertreten habe oder der ansicht bin es g be historische anspr che ungarns auf die vojvodina
2150723 zobel hat eine unverantwortliche aussage gemacht die weder von der deutschen regierung noch von der deutschen ffentlichkeit getragen wird das ausw rtige amt soll ihn zur verantwortung ziehen
2150724 es ist klar dass ein botschafter was immer er in einer offiziellen rede oder in einer pers nlichen u erung sagen mag stets die position der deutschen regierung vertritt allerdings ist in diesem fall die deutsche regierung nicht verantwortlich f r diese verr ckte u erung die botschafter zobel abgegeben hat er ist derjenige der die ffentlichkeit berzeugen soll dass ein derartiges missverst ndnis einmalig ist und sich nicht wiederholen wird und er muss sich vor der serbischen und vor der deutschen ffentlichkeit f r seine verantwortungslosigkeit entschuldigen
2150725 ich denke wir haben es hier mit einem dummen fehler zu tun der den grad der unwissenheit und uninformiertheit eines so hohen deutschen diplomaten offenbart mir pers nlich verursachen diese u erungen kummer es ist absolut unklar aus den vorgebrachten argumenten wie auch aus der ausdrucksweise was der eigentlich im sinne hatte als er das sagte was er gesagt hat
2150726 hinter den kulissen heftigste vorw rfe einstecken musste vermutlich wird er k nftig aufpassen und nur erkl rungen abgeben die nicht zu missinterpretieren sind dennoch bin ich nicht sicher dass eine abberufung zobels aus belgrad die beste l sung w re
2150727 dass berlin sich von den u erungen des botschafters distanziert
2150728 botschafter zobel hat in mehrfacher hinsicht die territoriale integrit t und souver nit t serbiens und die unverletzlichkeit seiner international anerkannten grenzen in frage gestellt damit die ihm bezeugte gastfreundschaft serbiens verletzt und sich an der w rde der staatlichen institutionen serbiens vergangen zu recht erwartet die regierung serbiens eine erkl rung der deutschen regierung ob botschafter zobel die offiziellen standpunkte der regierung deutschlands vertreten hat

2150768 hai orang yang berkemul berselimut bangunlah lalu berilah peringatan dan tuhanmu agungkanlah dan pakaianmu bersihkanlah dan perbuatan dosa tinggalkanlah dan janganlah kamu memberi dengan maksud memperoleh balasan yang lebih banyak dan untuk memenuhi perintah tuhanmu bersabarlah
2150769 allahu akbar wa lillahil hamd allah maha besar dan bagi nya segala pujian
2150770 dan ingatlah peperangan hunain yaitu di waktu kamu menjadi congkak karena banyaknya jumlah maka jumlah yang banyak itu tidak memberi manfaat kepada kamu sedikitpun
2150771 cukuplah allah menjadi penolong kami dan allah adalah sebaik baik pelindung
2150772 tidak akan masuk surga siapa yang didalam hatinya ada kesombongan walau seberat debu

2150782 yep im most productive between midnight and four a m apparently
2150783 current indicators a conservative but encouraging national budget some stability within the stock market and hints that the eskom power crisis can be managed positively suggest that this might be a lot sooner than many think
2150784 sentiment especially negative sentiment tends to have a significant effect on the property market
2150785 that is why massive hikes in interest rates flagging business confidence ever escalating prices and skills shortages that could threaten the countrys economic well being make it look as if all is gloom and doom
2150786 weve seen a major downward turn in the last three months
2150787 because many property owners have had to put their homes on the market due to financial constraints and because more and more people are opting to leave the country there is a great deal of stock on the market
2150788 this not only tends to put downward pressure on prices but also increases the competition in the marketplace
2150789 many also feel the time is ripe for a bargain at first sight this is a no win situation sellers have last years expectations and buyers are now sitting with this years sentiment
2150790 of course at the end of the day everything hinges on the interest rate environment and economic growth
2150791 consumer spending has slowed and even though inflation is not within target and your average consumer has no control over escalating petrol energy and food prices the reserve bank should now elect to maintain interest rates at current levels
2150792 the local economy will continue to grow albeit at a lower level and buoyed by a gradual global economic improvement we could see an improvement in business sentiment within as little as six months
2150793 the cherry on top will be a recovery in the property market by early 2009 and sellers will then be perfectly placed to put properties back on the market expecting to realize their true value
2150794 so even though manuels budget did not provide incentives for new property owners to enter the market he did not raise the r500 000 threshold for transfer duties or put forward a first time home owners subsidy it did provide some stability and a great deal of hope at the end of the day there are many reasons why sellers should hold tight for now there is definitely light at the end of this tunnel
2150795 its unusual for a real estate practitioner whose business is selling houses to advise people not to sell however this is good advice for those homeowners currently weighing up their options to take into account

2150803 was a sure indicator that an invisible social boundary had been transgressed in the early 19th century the stage coach had been alive with gossip and chatter as the novels of jane austen or the essays of william hazlitt record with the arrival of the steam locomotive however the talk stopped trains transported the body and mind but a more severe problem lay with those passengers themselves who were they rather than commit a social gaffe travellers on trains in britain chose silence
2150804 it was the individual not society that spoke loudly im on the train the history of mobile phones in britain is intimately tied to social transformations class transgressions and competition not only between technical systems but also between the politics of selfish individuality and the social bonds that tie us

2150807 soon after my arrival in the camp i was told by neighbours of a man who had called them several times on his mobile phone saying he was buried under the ruins of his house the last call had come two days before and though they had tried to call the man again and again he had not answered perhaps he was still alive the neighbours told me perhaps only the battery on his mobile phone had died
2150808 i want you to know that i love you very much in case i dont see you again
2150809 he went on im in the air he repeated that he loved me then he became distracted as if someone was speaking to him he said something to the effect that it was true then the phone went dead
2150810 there are a lot of explosives dont open fire on them i am very scared i ask you please do not start attacking
2150811 we have been using the phone more and more since the advent of the mobile the world we know best family friends has changed
2150812 with mobile phones of course it is possible to dump peopleromantically socially without ever actually admitting that you have done it youused to make plans for the evening and now you make assumptions if you can always contact someone you always arrange to meet them so you never meet them

2151479 when you spoke about and demonstrated empathy and about people not caring what we know till they know that we care and about the power of completely entering the world of another person i sensed possibilities open up for me and felt so hopeful and grateful to be alive i teach high school students and this workshop has provided me so many exciting tools and principles to enhance my service to my students

2151484 was momo so incredibly bright that she always gave good advice or found the right words to console people in need of consolation no she was no more capable of that than anyone else of her age what momo was better at than anyone else was listening she listened in a way that made slow witted people have flashes of inspiration it wasnt that she actually said anything or asked questions that put such ideas into their heads she simply sat there and listened with the utmost attention fixing them with her big dark eyes and they suddenly became aware of ideas whose existence they had never suspected momo could listen in such a way that worried and indecisive people knew their own minds from one moment to the next or shy people felt suddenly confident and at ease or downhearted people felt happy and hopeful and if someone felt that his life had been an utter failure and that he himself was only one among millions of wholly unimportant people who could be replaced as easily as broken windowpanes he would go and pour out his heart to momo and even as he spoke he would come to realize he was absolutely wrong that there was only one person like himself in the whole world and that consequently he mattered to the world in his own particular way such was momos talent for listening those who still think that listening isnt an art should see if they can do it half as well
2151485 i really think you need to speak with him one on one i think hes doing things that are not conducive for a healthy lifestyle

2151539 john edwards repeatedly lied during his presidential campaign about an extramarital affair with a novice filmmaker the former senator admitted to abc news today

2151545 you have made efforts to reach out to organized labor and yet when you painted your campaign office in amherst you chose to hire a non union painter
2151546 this action can do little more than raise the question of whether or not you are sincere in your pronouncements to support the issues important to working class men and women in this country
2151547 and then not feel it necessary to hire union workers yourself
2151548 repeatedly you have referred to yourself as a working class guy and you have made a point of highlighting why you dislike john kerry and where the two of you disagree on certain policy areas

2151558 an olympic athlete is as close to a super hero as we have
2151559 it confirms that were in a recession weve already seen the impact of slower job growth rising unemployment on demand for real estate and vacancies across the four core property types that we track as well as for the markets we track are rising
2151560 we will see property value losses we will see lower rents than buyers at the peak had expected that could lead to a bit of distress on the fringes in the market

2151580 these groups kept coming and going when i was in mossad it was part of our routine job to take them to training camps and make sure they got training worth what they paid for no more and no less the singhalese paid in cash
2151581 israel charged each of the 60 singhalese 300 per day for a total of 18 000 per day for a three month course israel charged them 1 6 million in addition israel charged them 5 000 to 6 000 an hour for helicopter rental with as many as 15 helicopters being used in a typical training exercise the israelis also charged for special training ammunition a bazooka shell for example cost about 220 a unit while heavy mortars were about 1000 each

2151585 the green built environment in the united states the state of the insurance marketplace
2151586 understanding how the risks emanating from green building differ from those emanating from traditional buildings is very important
2151587 if you purchased a green building and didnt give any thought to your property insurance i would certainly revisit it and look at some of these issues
2151588 you have soft costs you might not have in a non leed certified building
2151589 i do believe that theres something out there that will be able to achieve a consensus on restructuring
2151590 ive tried for the last three years and maybe what we need to do is take a step back and maybe a new face has to go talk to the shareholders to try and get something done
2151591 theres a lot of opportunities to raise capital in brazil as we are set up in brazil in a significant way to take funds in and not that many people are
2151592 we have taken advantage of this to grow our shopping centre presence in brazil
2151593 we believe that this opportunity for us will continue and are very excited about our shopping centre operations in the country
2151594 the country has supported a number of strategies to increase generation to meet the growing power demand
2151595 there remain many transmission bottlenecks and other problems but nonetheless there is a very strong and growing market for power in brazil today
2151596 we are cautious in this environment because usually the best opportunities come later in a cycle

2151598 the boom in hispanic population the majority of which comes from births rather than immigration continues to be the driving force in u s demographics the hispanic population increased in 95 of counties with an overall population greater than 10 000 whites are projected to fall below 50 of the total u s population by 2050 several states including texas california hawaii and new mexico have already hit that milestone among the black population the largest growth is among southern cities as many african americans migrate away from northern cities
2151599 my one great talent lies in making those who wrong me suffer horribly
2151600 create chaos and sedition and to blame the islamists for it
2151601 consequently the israeli mossad plays a great role in such bombings that take place inside iraqi mosques and churches and against the iraqi people
2151602 it is terrible and very worrying because it is the first time that christian places of worship have been targeted in iraq
2151603 it seems that someone wants to increase tension by trying to hit all groups the churches included
2151604 track down the criminals gangs and groups engaged in carrying out abductions killings looting bombings and assassinations
2151605 i wish to convey that as of now we have no confirmation of their release
2151606 neither our embassy in baghdad nor our embassy in kuwait have been able to confirm this
2151607 all of this is not true and we are still making contacts to secure the release of the hostages
2151608 all that is reasonable and logical in order to release the hostages
2151609 but we do not believe he is dead i will go to iraq to find him
2151610 we believe that relations between iraq and kuwait are stronger than un resolutions although we are committed to un resolutions
2151611 we are prepared to talk with the leaders in kuwait and the kuwaiti people about development and reconstruction operations
2151612 clearly announce that it has no connection with any such proposal
2151613 to weaken the resistance movement and to strengthen its illegal occupation
2151614 unfortunately the pakistani president and the saudi foreign minister are promoting this ridiculous proposition
2151615 he is confident that the general elections early next year to choose the first iraqi national assembly under the canopy of freedom and democracy will be a success
2151616 the main objectives of his grouping is to provide job opportunities for the unemployed appoint graduates upgrade the level of the necessary services adopt a solid economic policy safeguard the arab identity spread basic liberties and enhance womens capabilities to enable them to assume their full and effective role in iraqs reconstruction

2151618 talks between iraq and london continue to open the first iraqi airways office in london and resume regular flights between the two countries karim explains to al nahdah that an iraqi airways delegation is currently on a mission to discuss the reopening of the office that has been closed since 1990 following the severance of relations between the two countries
2151619 an official source at the ministry of transport as saying to al nahdah that the agreement between the two sides allows iraq to use the syrian ports and airports to transport goods to iraq
2151620 another agreement was signed between the two sides to purchase a vessel that will be used to transport goods for the two countries and to jointly operate 150 oil tankers for the iraqi transport ministry
2151621 iraq had reassumed its membership in the international atomic energy agency iaea he adds at a news conference that was attended by al mada that the iaea decided to grant iraq one million dollars to build eight projects that were suspended during the past incidents in iraq the minister also says that the italian government offered technical and financial facilities to iraq to establish an e government

2151623 dreams and hope cannot materialize unless democratic forces are activated at all levels and in every direction within a unified organizational framework

2151626 the progress weve made with the various synergies has been tremendous
2151627 in light of the progress made to date we have raised our run rate target to 250 million worth of synergies by the end of this year i have the firm belief that we can meet this revised target
2151628 this performance is quite impressive because the volume impact on sales was a negative 69 million year over year so all the top line growth came through prices
2151629 our commitment to paying down debt and improving our credit profile is slowing bearing fruit with s amp p raising our long term corporate credit rating as well as our senior secured and unsecured debt ratings in late july
2151630 probably would jump your stock but it would reduce our ability to pay down debt and it would have long term implications for the company
2151631 so we felt as management as a board that prudent management was to leave the distribution at 34 cents per unit per month which is still quite a healthy return for investors
2151632 we use it to protect a capital program we use it to protect acquisitions
2151633 we also use it as a bit of a smoothing tool where well engage in calendar hedges and smooth out prices over the year rather than go through the quarter over quarter volatility
2151634 our natural gas hedges have gone from being under water to being above the board right now
2151635 ive seen too many companies take the risk and fall under the thumb of too much debt and not be around and we were just not prepared to do that

2151671 but hadnt perfected the play yet and was still making dumb mistakes i dropped half my bankroll at one point some of that may have been negative variance but some was some flaws in my game
2151672 so keep it low until you really have a feel for what you are doing beyond what the book tells you 3 dont schedule the number of hands you are going to play at a level move up when your bankroll and your confidence can support it 4 dont just move up youre looking for the juiciest games those are the games with the highest average pot you are more likely to get limpers and raisers into your premium hands on these tables and also more likely to get paid off when you raise and 8 handed minimum dont go playing at short tables
2151673 so even though at low bankroll levels you probably dont want to move up until you have say 40 buy ins at higher levels 20 is okay cause you can always fall back at lower levels you cant fall back if you see a real juicy game at 35 buy ins it might be worth it but be careful by the same token there are juicy games at the levels below where you normally play get in on these too by the way on full tilt dont play the 05 1 tables as the rake is double the juicy games have 2 effects 1 they are more profitable 2 you earn more promotion points be aware they also add variance so be careful 5 be careful with that kq you should only be playing it in late position 6 question 1 limpers ahead pocket pair from real late position you can limp and try for a set dont raise with this hand it is too likely to get called with several limpers in the pot and if you are called more than once you are in trouble with aq or better however or say tt or better it depends on the table you need to have a feel for it often i will shove you a few times are dominated sometimes get the blinds sometimes get in a race and sometimes get rediculous calls like qj off or a5s or something you have to know the table and your image to decide the right play the same applies to a raise and callers this can be one of your most profitable situation if you have a guy that will raise with speculative or weak hands and another guy that calls with speculative hands shoving over the top often takes down a nice pot or gets called by a weak hand which might borderline have the odds to call you but you will usually be getting the best of it or be in a race 7 buy ins id say 30 40 minimum to move up form 1 25 to 25 5 same to move up to 5 1 after that you can scale that down to 20 or so for real juicy games but be ready to abandon ship and move down if things go wrong there is no way a third raise should ever be anything but all in from a short stack it is only on rare occassions that a second raise will be anything but all in 9 ive mentioned exceptions and rare occassions on ftp at 5 1 and above i run into the same players all the time you need to make notes to know who limps a monster who tries to steal from the button and lays down to a reraise who raises and folds who raises and calls with crap etc these notes will shape some of your decisions 10 if you dont have the stomach for bad beats quit considering playing ninja now i lose 200 pots to people calling me with 2 outs or worse all the time if you cannot accept and understand that this is a good thing you shouldnt play ninja its a good thing because if you dont sometimes get sucked out on that means your opponents arent making the mistake you rely on to be profitable if it burns you up in side when this happens dont play ssninja occassionally a rare pot will get to me but most of the bad calls that beat me dont phase me at all you have to realize that you are going to be felted a lot unless you find out which was happening during my downswing that you are not ahead or tied often enough preflop you have to be happy to take these losses because these mistakes make you a long time winner if you cant do that you may want to abandon all hope now 11 the minimum buy in is 20bbs however when you get felted you can usually buy in for less i usually buy back for 17 or so bbs i find this to be a more optimal stack size 12 this may sound silly but i usually bank as soon as i get to 21 5 bbs and the bb gets to me

2151682 en un mundo herido por conflictos donde la violencia es justificada en nombre de dios es importante repetir que la religi n no puede convertirse en un veh culo de odio nunca debe ser usada en nombre de diois para justificar la violencia
2151683 todo lo contrario las religiones pueden y deben ofrecer recursos preciosos para construir una humanidad pac fica porque hablan de paz en el coraz n del hombre
2151684 es sumamente importante intensificar esfuerzos por una estrategia seria de prevenci n concentrada en escuelas y en lugares de trabajo y para ayudar a los j venes a pasar su tiempo libre

2151691 quien piensa a la ligera del pecado jam s pens en serio acerca de dios
2151692 el pecado puede empezar brillante como la ma ana pero terminar oscuro como la noche
2151693 al principio el pecado es placentero luego se torna sucesivamente delicioso frecuente habitual y por ltimo se afianza asimismo el pecador se hace impenitente obstinado resuelto a no arrepentirse jam s hasta hundirse al fin en la ruina
2151694 las recompensas que el pecado ofrece al pecador son vida placer y ganancia pero el salario que le paga es la muerte tormento y destrucci n para comprender la falsedad y el enga o del pecado es necesario compara sus promesas con su paga
2151695 mas l herido fue por nuestras reveliones molido por nuestros pecados el castigo de nuestra paz fue sobre l y por sus llagas fuimos nosostros curados
2151696 no se turbe vuestro coraz n cre is en dios creed tambi n en m

2151698 perseverad en la oraci n velando en ella con acci n de gracias
2151699 escudri ad las escrituras porque a vosotros os parece que en ellas
2151700 porque las cosas que se escribieron antes para nuestra ense anza se escribieron a fin de que por la paciencia y la consolaci n de las escrituras tengamos esperanza
2151701 porque la palabra de dios es viva y eficaz y m s cortante que toda espada de dos filos y penetra hasta partir el alma y el esp ritu las coyunturas y los tu tanos y discierne los pensamientos y las intenciones del coraz n
2151702 as que la fe es por el o r y el o r por la palabra de dios
2151703 y tomad la espada del esp ritu que es la palabra de dios
2151704 entre tanto que voy oc pate en la lectura la exhortaci n y la ense anza

2151720 the corsairs have passed every one because they can put five scorers and defenders on the floor at any time
2151721 brandeis definitely boosted our confidence because it made us believe we could compete with nationally ranked teams
2151722 but at the same time we were very modest about it we werent satisfied with just that win
2151723 if there was ever any doubt of the validity of the ur mens basketball teams no 1 ranking it was stifled pretty quickly this past weekend when the jackets shut down the second ranked brandeis university judges en route to a 74 68 victory
2151724 however in a close game with approximately 10 minutes left four of the tartan starters were curiously on the bench the judges capitalized and extended their lead to 10 within a minutes time the lead did not drop below double digits for the rest of the game it looked like the team had a solid strategy forming during the run with strong double teams on brandeis leading scorer terrell hollins by junior terrance bouldin johnson and senior greg gonzalez with hollins neutralized and einwag providing solid defense on the judges captain and second leading scorer joe coppens the tartans were able to create turnovers and convert them into easy buckets their absence from the court at the 10 minute mark proved costly as hollins got back into a rhythm on the next two possessions converting one of two free throws and scoring on a lay up from an assist by coppens
2151725 we always try to attack from the inside out and our post players have been doing a great job sensing when to take it themselves and when to kick it out for perimeter shots

2151881 itv news correspondent julian manyon in the indonesian capital jakarta has been told by a highly placed western source that there was no plastic explosive and the bombers used a home made brew similar to that which the ira has relied on in the past in northern ireland and canary wharf
2151882 the ingredients are readily available in indonesia and experts suggest that they were almost certainly mixed together on the island of bali itself
2151883 we know that we will never be able to find any parts of their physical bodies but this ceremony will help their families to live in peace
2151884 in the town of solo about 100 students from the school run by islamic cleric abu bakar bashir briefly blocked access to the muhammadiyah hospital where he is being treated for cardiac and breathing problems armed policemen stood by but did not intervene
2151885 made from between 50 kg and 150 kg of chlorate
2151886 within 10 15 seconds of the first explosion at paddys bar a devastating explosion was detonated in front of the sari club the explosion resulted in a tremendous release of energy in the form of gas heat and light this essentially caused a pressure wave fragmentation and fire all of which contributed to the devastation seen at the sari club as a measure of the force of the blast the sound from the explosion was heard up to 15km away
2151887 the detonation wave pressure 1 000 000 to 1 500 000 pounds per square inch from a high detonation velocity contact explosive sweeps into the reinforced concrete structure as a wave of compressive deformation
2151888 this leaves a relatively smooth but granular surface with protruding bare reinforcement rods a distinctive signature of damage by contact explosives

2151890 al qaeda has accepted full responsibility for the bali bombing
2151891 at present nothing is possible except to extend the area of sanity little by little we cannot act collectively we can only spread our knowledge outwards from individual to individual generation after generation in the face of the thought police there is no other way
2151892 al qaeda might be planning to attack the west with a dirty radiological weapon
2151893 retracted six hours later by minister of home affairs david blunkett who said it was a
2151894 during early may 1993 itn world news from london carried an interesting feature in which it was explained that due to thefts of highly radioactive uranium 235 terrorists would now be able to contaminate conventional bombs with 500 grams of uranium thereby forcing the police to stay away from the area for days
2151895 there is no credible reason for keeping the police and other authorities away from a bombsite after the weapon has been detonated however the rumor could form the basis of a government defence in cases where american or british citizens located positive traces of radiation near the world trade centre or in the city of london for example
2151896 my conscience says that he is not a key actor i dont believe that amrozi has the capability to make all kinds of the preparations for the bombings like setting off a kind of micro nuclear bomb in bali
2151897 climb up light poles and take forensic swabs from roof tiles signposts and other places that had not been wet
2151898 could not have done it without help from foreign bomb experts we believe that the explosives were brought in from outside bali
2151899 the technology using mobile phones as a remote control is new for indonesia and something that requires guidance from foreign experts
2151900 we have all we need to nail these bad guys down
2151901 we are sure that foreign experts along with indonesian experts or perpetrators were involved

2151912 nobody does a better job of freezing defenders and you rarely see brady get careless with the ball

2151918 you have to understand there are two kinds of issues emotional issues and intellectual issues what you try and do is vilify those people on an emotional level and watch them explain intellectually you want to make them explain why if someone raped their wife they wouldnt want him executed

2151920 input costs are growing by the day while income is shrinking and there is a virtual collapse in rural economy as costs of healthcare education and aspiration of urbane lifestyles have only added to the distress sinking farmers deeper into debt burden and crisis
2151921 the bjp leader pointed out that average land holding in maharashtra was five to six acres and its was a major hurdle in making agriculture a viable industry around 95 of farmers in maharashtra are small time farmers an overwhelming majority of them do not have basic capital to invest in modernising their farms it does not make economic sense to invest in small farms there is a strong case for roping in corporates and forming farmers co operatives
2151922 making agriculture viable is the only solution to farm suicides
2151923 i am so sorry and so embarrassed i had no idea that was your office email not your personal email
2151924 never been so humiliated in all his professional life it was the most embarrassing thing that had ever happened

2151931 we were praying in the mosque when police barged in and started firing
2151932 the policemen were brutal they didnt even spare a boy who was trying to run away they shot him from point blank range
2151933 its been 14 years it will be 24 years and still justice will not be done
2151934 just as there are two indias shining and suffering there are two 1993s for mumbai the ghastly communal riots and the serial blasts

2151936 was quietly consigned to a commission of enquiry that classic indian euphemism for official stonewalling
2151937 like a veteran general commanded his loyal shiv sainiks to retaliate by organized attacks against muslims

2151939 they build cities and neglect the villages for gandhi the village which is self sufficient was the pillar on which this country stands instead we now have the enslaved village
2151940 mr carpio youre an hour and a half late you just broke your own record
2151941 reports reaching us till now point to over 60 use of bt seeds for sowing this year in western vidarbhas five districts with resowing on in some parts and delayed sowing in some places there is possibility of over 70 of the total the crop coming under bt seeds
2151942 because of unfavourable conditions in the region the seeds do not deliver results even the promise of reduction in use of pesticides because of the claimed disease resistance of bt seeds has proved false
2151943 there is no shrinkage in cotton growing area in the division
2151944 this year nearly 75 farmers in wardha have sown soyabean there is a major shift from cotton
2151945 last year soya fetched a very good price in the range of rs 1200 to rs 1700 per quintal moreover soya cultivation is relatively less expensive than cotton farmers are expecting soya prices to stabilise around rs 1300 per quintal

2151954 a tax credit program leaves important production decisions in the hands of builders buyers and and does not require expensive administrative oversight that is usually associated with a mandate
2151955 a tax credit program leaves important production decisions in the hands of builders buyers and this entry was posted on may 5 2008 at 11 08 am and is filed under
2151956 we have no offer for carlos and that is where we stand right now we dont want one and are not seeking one and we dont need to sell the player or any player at this stage
2151957 i dont have to offload players but i think its a natural situation that some were going to leave anyway
2151958 that will still happen but this is not because of our failure to get into the champions league
2151959 we had some money to spend before tuesday night and we still have that but we are having a difficulty in getting the level of player that we want
2151960 thats been a difficult task over the close season but there is money there for us to bring in a couple of players yet
2151961 we have specific areas of the pitch we want to improve but were hopeful in the remaining three weeks of the transfer window we can do that
2151962 nobody likes to be criticised in any way shape or form but when you become a football manager you dont expect to go through your career without receiving that at some stage
2151963 if you are not prepared to accept the criticism you should not be a football manager
2151964 when you lose in the manner we did on tuesday night to kaunas you expect criticism and it is deserved i totally accept that
2151965 i have had it before but all you can do is try to recover and get on with the job in hand thats exactly what we will do
2151966 im not responsible for how people react but we can only feel the disappointment of the result in kaunas and there is no doubt every one at the club feels it from the chairman all the way down
2151967 but we have to move on and make sure this does not affect our domestic results
2151968 we must look at the kaunas games and raise our standards starting this weekend against falkirk
2151969 consistently working with regulators towards a comprehensive solution for all auction rate securities investors
2151970 clear open military aggression from one osce country to another its neighbor unfortunately
2151971 i cant speak about any russian forces present this is a very obvious trick of the georgian side to place russia as a side of conflict
2151972 there are two sides of conflict in this conflict south ossetia and georgia
2151973 this is not a military operation this is an anti criminal operation
2151974 if this is not war then i wonder what is
2151975 the intense fighting in the south ossetian conflict zone risks escalation into a full fledged war
2151976 war would have a devastating impact for the entire region i urge the georgians south ossetians and russians to cease fire end military action and stop further escalation
2151977 we believe that standing up for our country means standing up against sexism and all intolerance demeaning portrayals of women cheapen our debates dampen the dreams of our daughters and deny us the contributions of too many responsibility lies with us all
2151978 whatever decision is made its going to be a collaborative decision
2151979 i think all this sort of speculation is much ado about very little
2151980 were just working out the details however those details play out that doesnt change the bottom line the fact that everyones on the same team here
2151981 i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2151982 you could argue that no ones ever ready to be president i mean i certainly learned a lot about the job in the first year you could argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can ever be fully ready for the pressures of the office and that everyone learns something and something different you could argue that
2151983 why is there a need for a package only for this area isnt there an agrarian crisis all over the country the suicides are a symptom of a much deeper agrarian distress
2151984 the main problems are the monsoon and the market rain fed agriculture is very risky after spending so much on cash crops the farmers find that the returns are lower than the cost there has to be crop insurance higher support prices institutional changes and a shift away from high cost intensive farming whats the point in putting money into a non sustainable system of agriculture
2151985 of course all these problems are linked to the agrarian distress but the rules say that a suicide victims family is eligible for compensation only if the deceased was indebted harassed by the bank or moneylender or suffered crop loss so many dont get it
2151986 those who can bribe officials get loans and aid but those who really need help do not get it
2151987 i didnt get any loan they made us run around with a lot of paperwork after a while i gave up and took rs 20 000 from the moneylender at an interest rate of 60 per cent per annum
2151988 people are unnecessarily opting for high cost and high risk products the input dealers who are also moneylenders force them to buy expensive products and their debt increases
2151989 bt cotton should not be cultivated in light and shallow soil without assured irrigation
2151990 two check dams and two mud bunds have been constructed in our village but they are in the jungle where there arent many farms only one farmer may have benefited and that too only for two months in the monsoon
2151991 most people arent aware that these government schemes exist you have to apply for them but no government official has ever come here so how will people know
2151992 i spent rs 8 500 to obtain a buffalo through the scheme but it doesnt give any milk instead im spending rs 250 every month to feed it i plan to sell it off soon but no one is willing to buy it either
2151993 it is simple all that the prime minister needs to do is make sure that we get a good price for our produce and write off our existing loans it will also eliminate all the corruption associated with this government scheme
2151994 if soyabean production increases traders will lower prices for the crop and farmers will suffer losses either way we lose thats why the government must assure a fair and stable price
2151995 by denying them a fair price we are making farmers bonded labourers in their own fields they cant even recover the cost of their family labour is it any wonder that they are in debt they are gambling with borrowed money without any coping mechanism
2151996 when property or share prices increase the state rejoices that the economy is booming but if food prices go up why do they shout inflation
2151997 you give subsidies to increase the export price of sugar you give subsidies to reduce the import price of wheat is it a sin to grow foodgrains in this country

2152004 i wasnt even holding a beer at the time im pretty sure he has a concussion
2152005 and i know you cant use j ger to clean a wound
2152006 when he came back his hair had some blood in it and there were grass stains all over his shirt
2152007 he was holding a license plate for some reason which he threw onto the roof
2152008 i offered to bandage his arm but he said his biceps would just break it

2152017 since this jounrey would be grander in scope than the weekly series we knew our score would need to reflet that watching the characters explore their new surroundings experience an unfamiliar culture and learn things about each other along the way with occasional tributes to japanese monster movies all provided a wonderful environment for musical inspiration

2152062 because it is not being played until now its effectively become an under 18 cup final although it is still our under 17 team from last season that will mainly be involved
2152063 regardless it should be a fantastic occasion and the fact that celtic have also reached the final will make it a bit special
2152064 old firm games at every level are always competitive and fans tend to come in high number to give their support so everyone is looking forward to the match
2152065 its a good education for our young lads to be in a final and its a beautiful trophy so we all hope we can get our hands on it on thursday night
2152066 there will be a lot of international players on show for us at broadwood and i celtic will have the same
2152067 the game is a good opportunity for fans to come along and see some of the players that are coming through the ranks below the reserves and under 19s
2152068 it should be a great game and fingers crossed we can bring another piece of silverware back to murray park
2152069 it should be a great night and to face celtic in a cup final will be a brilliant feeling
2152070 hopefully we can win the game and all the boys are well up for it

2152145 the wedding is merely the beginning of a lifelong process of handing over absolutely everything and not simply everything that one owns but everything that one is there is no one who is not broken by this process it is excruciating and inexorable and no one can stand up to it everyone gets broken on the wheel of love and the breaking that takes place is like nothing else under the sun that is the vulnerable place in all human relationships what is on the line always with every person we meet is our capacity to love and to be loved but whereas in most other relationships our vulnerability in this respect can be hidden more or less and how expert we are at hiding it in the relationship of marriage it is this very quality of vulnerability that is exposed exalted exploited and this is the thing that can prove to be too much for people too much to handle many give up and run away their entire lives collapsing in ruins but even those who hang on face inevitable ruin for they must be broken too

2152481 unlike the situation in china south africa will take years not weeks to resolve longer term power issues will continue to support metals prices
2152482 you have to question the timeframe for projects such as rio tinto ltd s coega smelter in south africa or bhp billiton ltd s mozal smelter expansion if such a smelter coega that is supposed to produce 700 000 metric tons is delayed thats obviously long term bullish for the industry
2152483 theres an elusive quest for energy throughout the world and as capacity growth in china slows and china will likely become a net aluminum importer in 2009 the world will rely more on aluminum supply elsewhere such as russia iceland and the middle east
2152484 there is no larger problem for a manufacturing and basic industry business than having unreliable energy supply
2152485 this is particularly relevant to the mining and smelting industries that rely on continuous production to maximize economic rent extracted from their assets
2152486 were forecasting a total of 830 000 tons of refined copper production in africa or 4 3 of forecast global supply for 2008 an increase of 12 year on year and substantially underpinning global growth

2152499 tapi mama sangat mengharapkan kamu ikut mama ngak tega meninggalkan kamu sendiri di sini biar nanti kuliahmu pindah juga bukankah di juga ada universitas muhammadiyahnya juga biar surat kepindahanya di urus oleh papamu
2152500 pa ma zahra ngak bisa ambil keputusan sekarang zahra binggung besok saja ya ma zahra mau bobok dulu assalamualaikum
2152501 dia tanpak ayu nan rupawan dikala jilbabnya menghias di kepala sorot matanya tajam dikala memandang senyum mengulum hiasi bibir manisnya
2152502 zahra ayu akan pindah kuliah di sini ia satu fakultas dan juga satu semester dengan kamu kakak berharap kamu bisa membantu dia beradaptasi dengan matakuliahnya dan juga dengan teman teman barunya
2152503 iya kak fadhill insyaallah saya akan bantu sebisa mungkin dan bukan hanya saya yang akan bantu temen teman juga
2152504 yang ini lo zahra aku kok lihat kamu bawa kemaren tadi aku temukan di sini
2152505 oh ya zahra beruntung sekali ya ayu dia dapatkan kak fadhill yang tampan baik pengertian juga pintar ketua bidang kpsdm lagi banyak gadis yang mengejar ngejar dia
2152506 seharusnya itu aku aku yang menikah dengan kak fadhill bukan dia
2152507 tapi zahra ni katanya lo kak fadhill sebenarnya tidak mencintai ayu tapi ia di jodohkan oleh papanya kak fadhill
2152508 ah itu mungkin hanya gossip kamu tau dari mana sih
2152509 eh ini bener dari sumber yang dapat di percaya dia di jodohkan oleh papaya
2152510 o jadi itu alasan kak fadhill mengambil keputusan yang mendadak itu berarti dia memang benar benar mencintai aku ini tidak adil seharusnya aku yang menikah dengan kak fadhill bukan dia aku harus berbuat sesuatu tapi apa apa apa yang harus aku lakukan agar kak fadhill berubah fikiran
2152511 zahra sini tugasku yang kemaren mana ada yang harus aku revisi sedikit
2152512 rina maaf ya mungkin ketinggalan di rumah biar aku ambil kamu tunggu sebentar ya
2152513 zahra gak usah kalo ngak ada ya ngak apa apa besok masih bisa lagi pula dikumpulkanya masih besok aku kasihan sama kamu harus bolak balik pulang
2152514 eh ya udah makasih ya kalo gitu aku kesana dulu ya
2152515 sebentar sini dech kamu tahu ngak kabar terbarunya kak fadhill
2152516 kamu inget ayu calon isterinya kak fadhill kasihan banget ya dia
2152517 kamu ini gimana to rin kemarem katanya bruntung sekali ayu sekarang kok tambah kasihan banget ini yang benar yang mana
2152518 zahra kalo orang lagi ngomong jangan di potong dulu donk gini lo maksudku kasihan banget dia bicause ibunya meninggal saat melahirkan dia ayahnya juga baru saja meninggal tau ngak ayahnya itu temenya papanya kak fadhill kamu inget kan papanya kak fadhill ginjalnya sakit sebelum ayahnya ayu meninggal ia mendonorkan ginjalnya untuk papanya kak fadhill sejak saat itu papanya kak fadhill berjanji akan menjaga ayu makanya ketika ayahnya ayu meninggal ia langsung di jodohkan dengan kak fadhill karna papanya kak fadhill benar benar menginginkan ayu menjadi anaknya
2152519 apa yang akan aku lakukan pada ayu kasihan dia dia tidak punya siapa siapa lagi di dunia ini kehadiran kak fadhill ibarat purnama saat gelap gulita bagi dia tapi begitu teganya aku ingin merebut purnama itu ayu lebih membutuhkan kak fadhill dari pada aku dia lebih pantas mendapatkan kak fadhill
2152520 ngak apa apa kok aku cuman teringat tugas kamu yang ketinggalan aku ngak enak sama kamu
2152521 zahra mengapa nangis kalau ada masalah cerita saja sama kakak mungkin kakak bisa bantu
2152522 tapi mengapa kak fadhill lebih memilih ayu dari pada aku
2152523 zahra sudahlah kamu ngak usah menangis lagi kakak tahu masalah kalian kakak tahu fadhill sangat mencintaimu bahkan dia berencana mengkhitbahmu saat dia lulus s1 nanti tapi mungkin allah berkehendak lain ayahnya menjodohkan dia dengan ayu kamu tahu saat itu ia binggung sekali dia telpon kakak ber kali kali tapi kakak ngak bisa kasih pendapat tentang hal ini karena ini menyangkut kebahagiaan kalian juga ayu dan yang lebih penting orangtua fadhill fadhilll juga menitipkan kamu ke kakak
2152524 ya kakak tau tapi apakah kamu tega bahagia di atas penderitaan orang lain ngak
2152525 zahra kakak tau kamu sangat berharga bagi kami kakak yakin kamu
2152526 papanya zahra sekarang tugas di malang jadi kami sekeluarga harus pindah ke malang ya mungkin ini yang terbaik buat aku jauh dari kak fadhilll dan ayu mugkin aku bisa merelakan kak fadhill menikah dengan ayu tapi aku ngak bisa jika harus selalu dekat dengan mereka karna itu hanya akan membuatku ingat pada kak fadhilll
2152527 ya kamu mesti cari penggantinya donk biar ngak terus inget sama fadhilll kakak mau jadi penggantinya

2152554 so im here in england visiting several pubs and have discovered a great tradition called quiz night which occurs on thursdays the bartender basicaly asks a series of 20 to 25 questions to teams in the pub each person pays about 1 dollar fifty pence here to participate and the winning team the team which gets the most answers correctly gets a portion of the total pot i think this would be a great brotherhood event and encourage brother tripod to consider it for events next year
2152555 im providing the guy with a steady stream of work which he wont want to jeopardize even if i make him wait for payment

2152654 for one thing even if you buy the premise that competition would reduce health care costs the idea that it could cut costs enough to make insurance affordable for americans with a history of cancer or other major diseases is sheer fantasy
2152655 workers and households pay for health insurance cost increases through lower wages and higher prices government has no source of funds other than taxes or borrowing to pay for health care
2152656 and the international evidence on health care costs is overwhelming the united states has the most privatized system with the most market competition and it also has by far the highest health care costs in the world
2152657 as mrs john edwards pointed out the mccain health plan would do nothing to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage to those like her and mr mccain who have pre existing medical conditions the mccain health plan is entirely based on blind faith that competition among private insurers will solve all problems

2152714 we dont see anyone from gawker covering medicare fraud a deadly helicopter crash or legislative gridlock in sacramento
2152715 man if i had a nickel for every time an advertiser told me they were looking to align their brand with medicare fraud or legislative gridlock may the force be with you sam zell
2152716 gawker et al will soon start adding a lot of star reporters from trad media who see the light this will bring more traffic breaking news and credibility the staff will grow as will costs but the growth in traffic should help offset
2152717 a man is really lost when suddenly it is always suddenly there comes to him the thudding consciousness that he cannot tell to save his life whether he should go north east south or west
2152718 instantly the unfortunate man is overwhelmed by a sense of utter isolation as though leagues and leagues of savage forest surrounded him on all sides through which he must wander aimlessly hopelessly until he drops from exhaustion and starvation
2152719 this man is really in serious peril the danger is not from the wilderness which can be forced to yield shelter and food to him who keeps his wits about him no the man is in danger from himself

2152723 the atps tennis anti corruption program is clear that gambling on any form of tennis match is prohibited atp executive vice president gayle david bradshaw said in a statement

2152725 if you divide the vitamin in half then you stabilize your dose during the day take half in the morning half in the evening
2152726 you want to give your body the right amount of fuel for when you need it vitamins have water soluble elements to them so they are quickly moved through your system

2152728 we can avoid the issues of sustainability because we can get a ton of it
2152729 you can grow algae pretty easily and its a much more efficient way of getting it
2152730 a crucial part of any well rounded diet includes one or two tablespoons of olive oil a day in foods like salad dressing
2152731 the same thing happens to our skin to our heart to our eyes
2152732 all foods with dark colors in them have some of these really protecting antioxidant chemicals in them
2152733 when eating tomatoes heat them up a little bit and put a little oil in them it makes it easier to absorb the lycopene
2152734 lycopene is another antioxidant but it has additional benefits as well which are particularly valuable for the heart
2152735 it has twice the antioxidant content as a blueberry so its a wonderful alternative
2152736 look at the food label and make sure they dont have too many carbohydrates in there its available in all major stores now its just sort of breaking through
2152737 its not very old and has been used for centuries for healing purposes
2152738 it turns on a system in your body that prevents your cells from aging now think about it where do they grow these grapes on trees on hillsides right its not a very hospitable environment so those grapes are sending a signal to us that life might not be so good so why not turn on that cellular chemistry that you have that allows you to live longer and better thats why we think this has a benefit
2152739 eighty percent of the benefit of the wine is actually the alcohol and 20 percent is the resveratrol

2152763 raises some questions about how a mccain administration might deal with a crisis like this
2152764 he remains a principal at his lobbying firm which had a phone conversation in november 2007 about georgia with richard fontaine an aide in mccains senate office

2152781 the reason the military and the police are individual entities operating completely apart from one another is one fights the enemy of the state one serves to protect the citizens of the state when the military becomes both then the enemy of the state tend to become the citizens of the state and tyranny results
2152782 society in every state is a blessing but government even in its best state is but a necessary evil in its worst state an intolerable one
2152783 truths are illusions about which we have forgotten that this is what they are
2152784 we must go back and reclaim our past so we can move forward so we understand why and how we came to be who we are today
2152785 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
2152786 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
2152787 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
2152788 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
2152789 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
2152790 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
2152791 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
2152792 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
2152793 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
2152794 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
2152795 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
2152796 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
2152797 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
2152798 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
2152799 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2152800 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
2152801 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
2152802 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
2152803 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2152804 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2152805 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2152806 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2152807 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2152814 today many american corporataions spend a great deal of money and time trying to increase the originality of their employees hoping thereby to get a competitive edge in the marketplace but such programs make no difference unless management also learns to recognize the valuable ideas among the many novel ones and then finds ways of implementing them

2152930 if either of you asks her if she knows me youll be jailed for contempt
2152931 no silly they use the dogs to find the fire hydrant
2152932 well its close to last orders so ill have a large scotch
2152933 excuse me sir how do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time
2152934 several years ago i was cleaning the attic and i found this old lamp when i rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes my first wish was that if i ever needed to pay for anything i just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money will be there
2152935 most people would wish for a million dollars or something but youll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live
2152936 thats right whether its a gallon of milk or a rolls royce the exact money is always there
2152937 you are a genius oh one other thing sir whats with the ostrich
2152938 oh my second wish was for a chick with long legs
2152939 stop stand still if you take one more step a brick will fall down on your head and kill you
2152940 stop stand still if you take one more step a car will run over you and you will die
2152941 and where the heck were you when i got married
2152942 excuse me god can i ask you a few questions
2152943 go on adam but be quick i have a world to create
2152944 when you created eve why did you make her body so curved and tender unlike mine
2152945 i did that adam so that you could love her
2152946 oh well then why did you give her long shiny beautiful hair and not me
2152947 i did that adam so that you could love her
2152948 oh well then why did you make her so stupid certainly not so that i could love her
2152949 well adam no i did that so that she could love you
2152950 you good for nothing bum where the heck have ya been you escaped over six hours ago
2152951 im a golf nut i live eat sleep and breathe golf
2152952 its probably because youre not keeping your wrists straight when you hit the ball
2152953 boys you saved the president of the united states today you deserve a reward you name it ill give it to you
2152954 and id like a wheelchair with a stereo in it
2152955 no but i will be when my dad finds out i saved you from drowning
2152956 if i can swallow it i can probably pass it
2152957 how would you diagnose a patient who walks back and forth screaming at the top of his lungs one minute then sits in a chair weeping uncontrollably the next
2152958 excuse me mrs smith but youre 75 years old what possible use could you have for birth control pills
2152959 how in the world do birth control pills help you to sleep
2152960 i put them in my granddaughters orange juice and i sleep better at night
2152961 its really hard for me to believe that either microsoft or adobe have the free and open web at heart when theyre actively subverting it with closed technologies like silverlight
2152962 html simply can handle what flash and silverlight can do
2152963 but its linux version of flash is always missing features compared to the same versions found on windows and mac
2152964 but since youve not provided specifics of any technology that we cant show can be provided by an open spec i hope youll excuse the rest of us if we take what you say with a grain of salt
2152965 the hard rock site yeah anyone can stick up a sign on a grey background saying silverlight required easy
2152966 deepzoom is an implementation that exposes some of the seadragon technology to silverlight
2152967 xbox 360 almost gets installs right using discs is so xbox 360 1 0
2152968 oh no i actually have to get up and switch a dvd from time to time
2152969 continue to use windows xp on the tens of thousands of pcs it has scattered around its offices rather than upgrade them to vista
2152970 vista is never going to be a blockbuster like xp
2152971 that windows 2000 is installed on 48 percent of all corporate pcs as of the first quarter of this year only falling four percent since the last quarter of 2003
2152972 a substantial number of companies have yet to decide whether to accept or embargo windows xp sp2
2152973 take off your beer goggles windows xp wasnt a blockbuster

2152975 the lawless lands of hdtv and why it should stay that way
2152976 there are signs that allah will grant islam victory in europe
2152977 i dont trust you morons anymore exhume my bones and bury them somewhere else before islamists turn my grave into a public latrine as they did to the graves of the same heads of states like me in the neighboring countries and tell those fiery chemically unbalanced females whom i thought i had freed to cover their shaved faces now i understand why you prefer to cover your faces of course excluding the paid actors you failed to compete with the pretty females of the world i was going to say cover your faces and share your beds with three more wives and numerous slave girls but i take it back since most of you have no husband worthy of the name
2152978 the term halloween is shortened from all hallow even as it is the eve of

2152992 youre running for president of the u s and you run down the country to a 7 year old
2152993 back then there were only a handful of guys that you really looked at and thought they could run any road racing series in the world
2152994 im not talking about adding four or even two more just one more would work call it the tiebreaker to see who really is king of the road

2152999 atheism is the inmates religion and the group that he wanted to start was religious in nature even though it expressly rejects a belief in a supreme being
2153000 up is down and atheism the antithesis of religion is religion
2153001 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2153002 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
2153003 we are receiving reports that a police of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2153004 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2153005 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2153006 all of us hundreds of thousands of georgians here and abroad should come together unite and fight to save georgia we are a freedom loving people and if our nation is united no aggressor will be able to harm it
2153007 we support georgias territorial integrity and call for an immediate cease fire we urge all parties to de escalate and avoid conflict
2153008 there are lots of volunteers being gathered in the region and its very hard to withhold them from taking part a real war is going on
2153009 these troops that are in georgia now they didnt come unexpectedly
2153010 they had been amassing at the border for the last few months they claimed they were staging exercises there and as soon as a suitable pretext was found they moved in
2153011 it is foolish and wrong to mourn the men who died rather we should thank god that such men lived
2153012 contemplate the mangled bodies of your countrymen and then say what should be the reward of such sacrifices if ye love wealth better than liberty the tranquility of servitude than the animating contest of freedom crouch down and lick the hands which feed you may your chains sit lightly upon you and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen
2153013 i never heard of a trojan or virus affecting 3 11 heck even dos today would be fine by me
2153014 we are hearing a lot about change especially in the presidential race
2153015 when we hear barack obama calling for change he is presenting the same economic policies that have been practiced in western pennsylvania for 30 years and after 30 years of government directed economic development our greatest export is young college graduates not coal or natural gas
2153016 to concentrate on building businesses that are meeting demands of national and international markets
2153017 we need to develop an economy that is independent of any one congressman
2153018 the biggest motivator in my decision to run is murthas stance on the war in iraq
2153019 he essentially put out a u s congress stamp of approval on enemy propaganda
2153020 when the north vietnamese depended on our anti war movement to undermine our political will to stay and fight

2153036 our extensive research confirms that there is very little correlation between test results and first year grade point averages or graduation rates and that high school preparation is a much stronger predictor for student success
2153037 we do not want to miss out on great students in addition test scores do not measure creativity motivation intellectual engagement or potential all things that a liberal arts college values
2153038 standardized tests demonstrate a bias that tends to disadvantage a large portion of our applicant pool and this policy change supports our commitment to a diverse community of learners

2153041 madam please dont give me that crap surly it was not a stag party you simply had no choice but to succumb to the will of your husbands hosts women in middle east are their mens achilles heels to protect this detrimental spot their owners need to attribute any available 4 character epithets to any woman who fails to cover up according to their divine dress code which altereth not by the way have you ever seen any arab leader or a marxist head of state accompanied by their wives in public ceremonies
2153042 madam i personally tip my hat to mr bush because he revealed a true american characteristic by holding up his own umbrella unlike his arab counterpart whose umbrella was held up by a servant later mr bush displayed another magnificent performance while coffee was being served he beckoned the coffee servant to come and stand next to him for a photo shot wonder if malik abdullah appreciated that toxic teaching

2153045 however when the eyes of two war elephants were gouged out by two arab warriors the whole weapon system turned against their own masters consequently the war was lost and a great civilization was annihilated
2153046 what happened to the wives of the king and the nobles

2153049 the fact that amazon has a well documented history of using partner data to their advantage in the third party selling world will make this argument very believable

2153051 amazon went to my supplier and was able to get it cheaper and now im at a disadvantage
2153052 if you worry that amazon retail may compete with you on the platform then you need to take that seriously into consideration because it does happen a lot especially in the hits business

2153075 nuestras decisiones no son aisladas y van absolutamente en el camino contrario al clientelismo pol tico
2153076 un gobierno est para desplegar las pol ticas sociales necesarias para llevar la justicia social a los que menos tienen mientras tanto apostamos a una provincia a una ciudad que siga creciendo que siga generando empleo
2153077 hemos invertido y dado soluciones los misioneros de la mano de la renovaci n con recursos nuestros exclusivamente de los misioneros m s de 100 millones de pesos
2153078 quiero arrancar asumiendo la realidad de las cosas y un compromiso este es un buen acto de gobierno detr s de este acto de gobierno hay una clara vocaci n de llevar en alto la justicia y la sensibilidad social a cada uno de los sectores m s humildes de la provincia pero desde el realismo que siempre debe guiar nuestras acciones de gobierno no tengo duda alguna de que este es un acto que como moraleja principal nos deja que todav a tenemos demasiado por hacer demasiado entregamos camas cuchetas de un plan que es sencillo le pregunt a cada una de las tres madres que recibieron y que me toc a m el gusto y el honor de entregarles cu ntos hijos ten an una me dijo seis la otra me dijo ocho y la otra me dijo nueve nueve ocho y seis misioneritos llenos de esperanzas de sue os pero llenos de necesidades una madre sin que yo le pregunte me dijo me llevo para darle de dormir a cuatro chicos f jense en esta decisi n de gobierno claramente acertada y notoriamente insuficiente c mo uno devuelve a un chico con un poco m s de dignidad con un poco m s de privacidad tener un mejor descanso y la posibilidad de tener mejor calidad de vida y mejor rendimiento en la escuela uno da algo por lo menos de lo tanto que hace falta
2153079 hablaba reci n con el intendente con el ministro de bienestar social y con el presidente del iprodha y les contaba que ah cuando la gente se acercaba tres personas se acercaron a pedir el beneficio de la cucheta hoy es el d a que lo lanzamos y aunque suene gracioso el nombre claramente ha sido un acierto y claramente saben el presidente del iprodha y el ministro que tienen que hacer y salir a comprar varias cuchetas muchas cuchetas miles de cuchetas porque cuando algo es requerido y es aceptado por el pueblo por m s simple y por m s sencillo que sea debemos llevarlo a todos los rincones de posadas y de la provincia en esta reflexi n inicial quiero recordar algo que ocurri en tiempos de la campa a electoral hubo una fuerte granizada y en ese momento este barrio como otros qued pr cticamente a la intemperie vinimos ac estuvimos caminamos y hoy volvemos pero este lugar tiene un aspecto en este caso distinto los techos brillan los techos son producto de este plan emblem tico iniciado en su oportunidad por el ingeniero rovira y continuado mes a mes por esta gesti n y este proyecto de provincia de la renovaci n volvemos satisfechos por haber cumplido
2153080 ese d a y otra vez en el municipio de loreto escuchaba a quien era intendenta en ese momento reivindicar como una de las pol ticas centrales de la renovaci n al plan techo y lo refer a de una manera muy gr fica y sencilla en su discurso a la noche a las 12 de la noche cuando empieza a tronar ya hay cientos de familias que no tienen miedo de que les caiga la gota fr a y les moje el colch n y la s bana algo que para muchos que tenemos necesidades absolutamente resueltas o tuvimos quiz s m s suerte nunca nos hubi ramos imaginado o que muchos de lo que hoy no participan de la vida pol tica no conocen o no llegaron a ver con real magnitud c mo las necesidades por m s sencillas que parezcan son vitales esenciales a la hora de hablar de la calidad de vida
2153081 yo hac a c lculos y de vez en cuando hay que tirar algunos n meros 33 000 planes techo a lo largo y a lo ancho de la provincia est para ver vayan por la ruta 12 miren al costado en la zona de caraguatay no hay un solo techo que sea de cart n y todos tienen el emblema del iprodha pasen mado delicia y miren al costado cualquiera de las casas todas las casas brillan bajen el cerro de dos de mayo y miren all todas creo que 600 casas en el municipio de dos de mayo recibieron el plan techo 33 000 por 3 000 hemos invertido y dado soluciones los misioneros de la mano de la renovaci n con recursos nuestros exclusivamente de los misioneros por m s de 100 millones de pesos que llegaron a m s de 33 000 soluciones y de esto tenemos que sentirnos orgullosos
2153082 tenemos mucho por hacer pero estoy seguro de que no existe gobierno provincial en el pa s y tampoco en la historia misionera que le haya dado continuidad a un proyecto y complementado como hoy lo estamos complementando de la mano del plan cucheta
2153083 siglo xxi inform tica computadoras todo lo que uno pueda imaginar en la mayor a de estas casas seguro que hab a porque somos as por lo menos uno sino dos o tres tel fonos celulares estoy seguro de que si hacemos una encuesta alguien por lo menos en esa casa ten a tel fono celular pero no ten a luz el ctrica a la hora de resolver la luz el ctrica m s all de la cuesti n econ mica que me dec a un vecino esto resuelve un tema principal porque si yo tengo que bajar la luz me cuesta no menos de 500 600 pesos adem s de eso ten amos el problema de la tenencia de la tierra como en muchos casos y aparece entonces esta decisi n tambi n inteligente de emsa con este proyecto de energ a solidaria que le garantiza un consumo gratuito de 40 kw por familia y luego el exceso vale 20 pesos como una tasa le pedimos a todos que cuiden que de no tener nada hoy tienen energ a y que gasten siempre lo menos posible en beneficio de ustedes en beneficio de misiones en beneficio del planeta y de la humanidad creo que hoy sin duda alguna muchas de estas casas han dado un salto a lo que para algunos es parte de la vieja historia pero para otros es la puerta de entrada al siglo xxi a la luz el ctrica a la heladera al televisor a tantas cosas que parecen muy sencillas como tener un techo que otros no ten an o dormir en una cama cuando miles no duermen en cama y apretar un bot n y que se prenda la luz cuando miles y miles todav a hoy no la tienen
2153084 hay un fuerte componente social en este acto con decisiones que no son aisladas que contin an y que van absolutamente en el camino contrario al clientelismo pol tico el clientelismo pol tico tiene en su esencia la vocaci n de hacer depender a un ser humano de otro que una persona dependa de otra y para eso mientras m s veces dependa mejor mientras m s veces le tenga que ir a pedir al capo de turno mejor y en cada una de nuestras decisiones como ver n el concepto es totalmente distinto se busca darle soluci n de una vez por todas simple sencilla la cucheta se queda en la casa no hay que pedirle al capo todas las nochecitas prest me la cucheta que quiero ir a dormir la chapa de cart n ya no est m s no hay que estar pendiente en cada granizada para ir a ver qui n consigue la chapa de cart n para que el a o que viene otra vez se necesite la chapa de cart n estas son cosas que hay que tenerlas en claro porque desde el punto de vista de la justicia social son cosas bien distintas ojal pudi ramos construir una sociedad realmente igualitaria en la que con la estructura del trabajo con el esfuerzo del trabajo y con el ingreso cada uno pudiera comprarse su casa su techo bajarse la luz comprarse su cama pero para eso est un gobierno para desplegar las pol ticas sociales necesarias para llevar la justicia social necesaria para los que menos tienen mientras tanto apostamos a una provincia a una ciudad que siga creciendo que siga generando empleo
2153085 les pido especialmente a todos padres madres hermanos mucho empe o en la educaci n much simo empe o en la educaci n de cada una de estas casas los chicos tienen que salir todas las ma anas todas las tardes e ir a la escuela primaria y muchos de ustedes a la escuela secundaria y porqu no muchos de ustedes pueden llegar a la universidad o a una tecnicatura poner mucho empe o en la educaci n la educaci n es una herencia que debemos dejar a cada uno de nuestros chicos y es lo que les va a posibilitar de la mano del trabajo romper el c rculo vicioso de la pobreza y transformarlo en el c rculo virtuoso del crecimiento de la inclusi n y del desarrollo

2153118 because of your unbelief for assuredly i say to you if you have faith as a mustard seed you will say to this mountain move from here to there and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you however this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting
2153119 do not fear for those who are with us are greater in number than those who are with them
2153120 lord open the eyes of the servant and let him see
2153121 i say to you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my father who is in heaven
2153122 lest my sons consider evil things in their mind against god
2153123 therefore i say to you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink nor about your body what you will put on is not life more than food and the body more than clothing look at the birds of the air for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not of more value than they which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature therefore do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for after all these things the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about its own things sufficient for the day is its own trouble
2153124 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives and he who seeks finds and to him who knocks it will be opened or what man is there among you who if his son asks for bread will give him a stone or if he asks for a fish will he give him a serpent if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more will your father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him
2153125 if you are elijah and i this jezebel may god do so to me and more also if at this hour tomorrow i do not make your life like the life of one of them prophets of baal that were slaughtered
2153126 i pray it be enough o lord now take my life for i am no better than my fathers
2153127 arise and eat because the journey is a great many days for you
2153128 come to me all you who labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for i am gentle and lowly in heart and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light
2153129 for your sake we are killed all day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter
2153130 for yet a little while and he who is coming will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith but if anyone draws back my soul has no pleasure in him
2153131 we are told by the holy fathers that we are supposed to see in everything something for our salvation if you can do this you can be saved
2153132 the true christian is a warrior making his way through the regiments of the invisible enemy to his heavenly homeland
2153133 anyone who is attracted merely by glittering censors incense and beautiful vestments he first of all will fall down before antichrist
2153134 when i became christian i voluntarily crucified my mind and all the crosses that i bear have only been a source of joy for me i have lost nothing and gained everything
2153135 do not trust your mind too much thinking must be refined by suffering or it will not stand the test of these cruel times

2153140 are you sure i cant eat this or just roll around in it
2153141 hey world look at me i am funny pretty exciting and great to be around come over here and play
2153142 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2153143 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2153144 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2153145 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
2153146 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2153147 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2153148 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2153149 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2153150 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2153151 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2153152 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2153153 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2153154 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2153155 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2153156 who are open to doing something on the production side
2153157 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2153158 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2153159 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
2153160 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
2153161 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
2153162 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

2153168 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2153169 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free
2153170 wow ha this is really unique and in my expert opinion it would only serve to enhance and bring more business to us at name of search engine withheld for legal amp confidentiality reasons and not cause us to lose business in the slightest amazing
2153171 buckling down and pressing my secret to its fullest potential
2153172 well see just how long i can make it available before it saturates things
2153173 hes already so amazingly rich that whether he continues or discontinues its sale will neither make nor break the man but not grabbing it for yourself while its still available could prove disastrous for you as you may only have one chance and a very limited one at that to get this
2153174 today will be different today im going to start living
2153175 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
2153176 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
2153177 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
2153178 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
2153179 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
2153180 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
2153181 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2153182 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2153183 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
2153184 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
2153185 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
2153186 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
2153187 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2153188 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2153189 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2153190 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

2153200 what weve found is that advertisers and agencies are only interested in professional media so professional content providers are having a good time finding extremely high demand because they have a lack of video views
2153201 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
2153202 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
2153203 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2153214 they have been calling it training exercises but they have not been concealing the fact that they are training these troops for use inside georgia

2153229 these last tragic events should become the last step toward recognition of south ossetias independence
2153230 they are not involved in any way in this conflict between the russian military and the georgian military
2153231 we have upwards of 100 military trainers who are in georgia now weve been able to account for all of them
2153232 we have forces in georgia so obviously the secretary is interested in the situation there
2153233 what they do in a situation like this is contact the embassy contact our troops there assess the situation and begin to receive any information or request for support from the embassy or any reports about us citizens being in danger
2153234 at this point we are early in the hostilities the situation is sort of dynamic at this point
2153235 we are looking at the situation and how it develops its still early

2153277 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2153278 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2153279 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2153280 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2153281 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2153282 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2153283 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2153284 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2153285 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2153286 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2153287 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2153288 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2153289 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2153290 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2153291 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2153292 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2153293 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2153294 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2153295 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2153296 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
2153297 we are deeply deeply concerned and we have launched an appeal for both sides to agree immediately to a cease fire
2153298 we think it is not acceptable to see these scenes of bloodshed and destruction
2153299 in the past it was always kids with prader willi syndrome are short and fat and retarded
2153300 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of tskhinvali
2153301 if this is not war then i wonder what it is
2153302 we are receiving reports that a policy of ethnic cleansing was being conducted in villages in south ossetia the number of refugees is climbing the panic is growing people are trying to save their lives
2153303 we repeat our message to all parties to immediately stop the violence
2153304 up until then most writing for women had been about teaching them how to be perfect better cooks better wives
2153305 it was aimed at people with only one hob ring
2153306 it had a huge secondary market of people who were beginners up until then all the cookery books had been written for people with proper kitchens
2153307 what has really changed is mainstream journalism which is much more feature oriented the papers are so much bigger the feature pages deal with personal relationships health education

2153756 you are one lucky girl to have a guy like him he irons
2153757 i saw crushing wounds but there were very few walking wounded
2153758 i saw bodies lying on the streets around ruined buildings in cars
2153759 its impossible to count them now there is hardly a single building left undamaged
2153760 they have sent in their troops and weapons and they are bombing our towns
2153761 in accordance with the constitution and federal law i as president of russia am obliged to protect lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are located
2153762 we wont allow the death of our compatriots go unpunished
2153763 political climates and cultural climates kind of go together that was a more conservative era in lots of ways
2153764 substantial decreases in the severity of americas drug related problems
2153765 we felt that it was kind of one of the last untouched subjects that kind of sex had been done on hbo on various shows and that drugs had kind of been left alone because it was the last taboo
2153766 if kids can be influenced to smoke cigarettes which are illegal to sell to minors why should we believe that a child would not be as inclined to smoke marijuana which is not legal

2153768 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2153769 the weather here is great its warm and it provides a good chance for a good performance
2153770 if the field is good and the pace right i cannot rule out a world record
2153771 the warm weather helps great performances because the muscles do not contract like they do in the cold the training we did in nairobi itself was good enough and we will not let the country down
2153772 i respect mutola very much as i have run with her a lot of times while janeth is my very good friend with whom we have trained as a team and planned well to bring glory to kenya on the day it is gods mercies that will provide the winner
2153773 about the russians it is not good to use drugs to gain unfair advantage
2153774 i carried just enough to keep me going throughout the games this milk is rich in calcium and i take it sometimes three times a day
2153775 i really noticed the first day that it was pretty smoggy we landed on the plane and i think we were all like wow is this weather is this smog is this fog what is it it was kind of surprising to see that
2153776 the air quality i think its good it looks a little bit misty you cannot judge the air quality by its appearance you have to trust the scientists
2153777 all those results have brought us to the gate of the olympic games we will be able to ensure that air quality during the games is good enough
2153778 with this rain we expect the weather in beijing to be clearly improved
2153779 we have to look at the favorable weather conditions which can help spread and remove major pollutants

2153792 imagine having 2008 08 08 stamped on your marriage certificate everyone cannot wait and we are ready to go just like the rest of the world we feel the olympic values are gripping everyone
2153793 the whole team will be at that starting point by eight in the morning tomorrow to support eric
2153794 we feel we are not alone in this imagine having family members calling athletes from windhoek to strengthen them dr nujoma has been trying to meet us but that may be impossible now because of the hectic traffic around the town but we have had the fatherly support of ambassador lazarus nambahu he is making us feel at home

2153804 standard bearers for the poorly conceived hypothesis that children receive too many vaccines too early
2153805 some parents are choosing to delay withhold or separate vaccines
2153806 the failure of the media and the public to distinguish hypotheses from scientific evidence
2153807 i have never done a scientific paper nor do i write a column without doing all the background research needed to make sure that what i am a saying can be validated by legitimate sources
2153808 other than hey i have been called worse than that
2153809 the bigger issue is that this is a serious scientific discussion its serious for parents its serious for children and its serious for physicians and it need not be turned into something personal
2153810 by just testing something for safety but not comparing it to something else that doesnt tell us everything we need to know
2153811 it all depends on what you are defining as safety
2153812 is it less safe to give hepatitis b vaccine when a child is 8 or 10 years old than when they are newborn has that been looked at
2153813 no research has been done on the vaccine schedule to say it is the right one compared to other schedules as far as i know there have been no randomized trials comparing different vaccine schedules to what is better medically for children
2153814 are we giving children too many vaccines in a very short period of time so early in their lives that is the study that has not been done looking at the schedule looking to see if it is better to spread out some vaccines over a longer period of time
2153815 are there fewer side effects fewer fevers we have very different schedules that should be compared have any of them ever been compared with the current one in terms of the health effects on children
2153816 i am not as noble as dr healy and cannot resist suggesting that he cannot examine others intestinal tracts without first extracting his head from his own
2153817 im intra muscular absorption of some drugs in infants and young children may be unpredictable due in part to insufficient muscle tone and vascularity of muscle tissue
2153818 they recommend tailored vaccination schedules if need be and one of them had a few paragraphs on vaccine induced encephalopathy which somebody had asked me about before so it is out there
2153819 you poor ignorant fool i was once in your shoes and i cant believe i was ever so stupid
2153820 maybe its not a good idea to bring back dinosaurs
2153821 maybe we shouldnt put computers in control of nuclear bombs
2153822 i cant believe they have to advertise for this who wouldnt vaccinate
2153823 good for some since the rest of us are vaccinating our children
2153824 thanks for the info but i just really think were going to vaccinate because it seems irresponsible not to
2153825 instead i find myself looking for some word which probably doesnt exist in the english language but if it did would probably mean something along the lines of

2153850 everywhere it is the same the deliberate avoidance of simple literal obedience how is such a reversal possible what has happened that the word of jesus has to endure this game anywhere else in the world where commands are given the situation is clear a father says to his child go to bed the child knows exactly what to do but a child drilled in pseudo theology would have to argue thus father says go to bed he means you are tired he does not want me to be tired but i can also overcome my tiredness by going to play so although father says go to bed what he really means is go play
2153851 to what shall i liken the basic principles of liberal theology is it not like a clock which is so cleverly constructed that the hands move from right to left instead of from left to right
2153852 barangsiapa yang mendatangi tukang ramal lalu bertanya kepadanya tentang sesuatu maka tidak diterima sholatnya selama 40 hari
2153853 barangsiapa yang mendatangi seorang peramal lalu mempercayai apa yang dia ramalkan maka ia telah kufur terhadap wahyu yang diturunkan kepada nabi muhammad shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
2153854 tatkala allah telah menetapkan satu urusan di langit para malaikat mengepak ngepakkan sayap mereka untuk menunjukkan ketundukkan mereka terhadap firman allah seolah olah firman allah itu adalah rantai di atas gundukan tanah yang menembus diri mereka
2153855 ia memfirmankan kebenaran belaka sesungguhnya dia yang maha tinggi lagi maha besar
2153856 bukankan si fulan telah mengatakan kepada kita demikian pada hari ini dan itu

2153860 we haz a new member of the family staying with us now
2153861 increasingly we think that people witnessed a fireball which are not uncommon went off to investigate and found a lake of sedimentary deposit which may be full of smelly methane rich organic matter
2153862 lots of people from the town of carancas have fallen ill they have headaches eye problems irritated skin nausea and vomiting
2153863 i think theres also a certain psychological fear in the community
2153864 that is why we are asking for an analysis because we are worried for our people they are afraid
2153865 this is the water we use for the animals and for us for everyone and it looks like it is contaminated
2153866 we dont know what is going on at the moment that is what we are worried about
2153867 hari ini telah kita dapatkan hal hal yang lebih mulia daripada alasan pertemuan kita ini yaitu menahan kemurkaan menguasai kemarahan menggenggam kesabaran dan menghiasi diri dengan kelembutan
2153868 pernahkah engkau mengetahui bahwa diriku melakukan sesuatu atas dasar dorongan nafsu dan marah
2153869 saya menguasai nafsu dan marah sementara keduanya menguasaimu jadi engkau adalah budak dari budakku
2153870 orang yang tidak percaya pada siapa pun dan tidak dipercaya oleh siapa pun
2153871 jika semua orang yang telah engkau perlakukan dengan salah engkau ijinkan untuk menghukum dirimu pasti engkau akan segera meninggalkan kezaliman ini

2153874 why hasnt she been doing anything she must be dead
2153875 ive been working over the last year to really fine tune a few things that will hopefully improve my 400 im well see what happens
2153876 i believe swimming has come of age its just gotten so fast
2153877 ive seen training the previous nine months before our trials like nothing ive ever seen and they dont train in the suits so its got to be a combination i mean if they have little outboard engines then you could give all the credit to the suits
2153878 dieser verlust der mitte schleicht seit 15 jahren voran doch die warenhauskonzerne haben erst sp t auf diese entwicklung reagiert
2153879 das ganze wird in deutschland aber nicht so konsequent betrieben wie im ausland
2153880 deshalb versuchen warenh user statt eine preisf hrerschaft anzupeilen eine gewisse emotionalit t in ihren gesch ften zu erzeugen
2153881 wenn sie sich das kadewe in berlin oder das alsterhaus in hamburg vorstellen dort wird etwas umgesetzt in richtung emotionalisierung
2153882 wir sehen dass die warenh user heute diesen anspruch alles unter einem dach zu haben nicht mehr alleine haben
2153883 the attention ive gotten since ive been here has been overwhelming the bottom line as we all know is to win games thats what im here to do
2153884 i cannot tell you where the tree is going to be for obvious reasons because itll be stripped bare in about 30 seconds
2153885 if you had picked a number higher you wouldve gotten more money on your metrocard
2153886 let me warn you that when you get on and off the train during rush hours just be sure to follow your blockers
2153887 you win the super bowl and i promise you will get a key
2153888 the future is now i dont have 17 more years to play i dont think i want to give the new york jets and the people of this city the best year possible believe me
2153889 to a certain degree i dont know what im getting into
2153890 hopefully i can bring as much excitement throughout the year as weve had the last two or three days
2153891 there was a time back in the late 90s when teletext holidays through its clunky old tv text site was responsible for shifting nearly one in six of all last minute holidays and almost one in eight of all holiday packages sold in the uk
2153892 too young for childhood soothing and too young for adult stress relievers
2153893 we need our big strong guy in the main event and it hurts that hes not there
2153894 at this point in time hes saying that hes done
2153895 he wishes that all of his hard work was to be paid off at this point to be called an olympian to be here with all the other athletes
2153896 we play the game fairly and were being penalized it just seems the u s could not get a break i dont know what it is
2153897 we expressed our deepest sympathy to the u s team but those are the rules and mathematics and we cant change that
2153898 i cannot comment on that because i think its crazy if they can prove that they have been intentionally punished then ok prove it go to the court
2153899 that was just our first game the two remaining games against germany and brazil will be difficult but well improve with every match that was just a temporary setback were bottom of the group at the moment but by no means out of it
2153900 uganda will march in 35th position as opposed to be being in the hundreds near the end because u comes early in the chinese alphabet
2153901 in this alphabet we are even ahead of countires like australia who usually kick off olymppic marches
2153902 the athletes stop training at midday and the village is out of bounds for visitors of any kinds to allow them to prepare for the opening ceremony
2153903 even though the ceremony doesnt start until 8pm the organisers will begin to ferry the athletes to the birds nest at 2pm and uganda leaves with the first batch because of our ealr march
2153904 i can confirm that i have successfully negotiated for a payout but i cant disclose further than that im happy that im now a free agent and i thank thanda management for being good to me its a pity that im leaving but life must go on
2153905 i cant say what my next destination will be im still in durban weighing up the options there is some interest from some teams but i will wait for a concrete offer
2153906 i dont think we can be any more positive on how well hes done
2153907 hes a regular ghanaian international and paul really likes what he sees in him
2153908 we have only got two wide men mcsheffrey and larsson and quincy gives us added strength to that department
2153909 we hope he has an impact and makes a difference in the wide area
2153910 one of his big assets is that he has pace to burn there are a lot of people with pace to burn and it is how they use it that is key
2153911 when i spoke to him he sounded like a determined guy who wants to be a star
2153912 the next step is up to him he is young and you would like to think he has learned from the past and matured
2153913 like a lot of young players the world can be at their feet and then their career can hit a wall they keep soaring and then plateau and wonder what has happened
2153914 the defendant left the state of michigan left the country without prior notice to the court all you have to have him do is call me he has my cell phone he can call me anytime we would never say the mayor of detroit cannot travel for an emergency matter that is a flagrant violation of this courts order at the very least we are going to ask the court to cut off all travel to the defendant for business or personal because he violated the very generous terms that this court has set up its not serious to him that hes a criminal defendant

2153926 le gouvernement nest r ellement contraint dy proc der ni du fait de la hausse du co t du p trole ni en raison de la sant financi re de gdf suez et dedf qui est excellente

2153930 du cynisme consistant mettre en oeuvre des mesures impopulaires au coeur de l t on peut en revanche sinterroger sur les motivations de cette d cision qui c de aux pressions des entreprises concern es en d pit des tensions persistantes sur le pouvoir dachat des m nages
2153931 inadmissible de prendre de telles mesures sans organiser une concertation avec les repr sentants des usagers
2153932 senator obama will campaign around the country our surrogates will be active and the campaign itself will continue working with our grassroots volunteers to get our message out
2153933 of course attention will be diverted some but with only 20 days until our convention and about 90 until election day there isnt much time to lose
2153934 during the games were poised to be on the airwaves highlighting john mccains experience and proven judgment to lead
2153935 i would basically go silent for the next two weeks i think the american people have reached a saturation point with both senator obama and senator mccain
2153936 you spend some time fundraising you do not take anything away from the olympic spirit or more importantly the american athletes
2153937 the american people want to root for american athletes they dont want to be distracted at the moment theyre not going to forget that mccain and obama are out there the campaigns have to put the ego in check a bit
2153938 there are two marathons going on one in the olympic games and one in the presidential campaign and i dont think the presidential candidates can cease running their marathons during the olympics
2153939 all you had to do is think through the advantage that was given to someone like bush who could spend an additional 60 million in primary money and we couldnt and only spend the general election money
2153940 thats when clinton started his now famous bus tour going through the midwest we certainly didnt stand down
2153941 use a little creativity why not say if flip flopping were an olympic sport john mccain would be the first 72 year old to win a gold medal
2153942 ninety to ninety nine percent of the matter of the universe is made up of a dark matter invisible which generates propels and surrounds the visible like the sea surrounds the continents

2153950 i havent worked at cd baby since last year in fact ive hardly been there since 2002
2153951 bury the proposed incinerator plans for poolbeg peninsula in dublin in light of todays government waste statistics
2153952 the latest statistics from the ministers own department of environment indicate there is no need for an incinerator in dublin the proposed incinerator is unviable as much as it is unwanted and the minister must come out support that position the fact that this incinerator is in the minister for environment deputy john gormleys very own constituency shows how important it is for his credibility to step in and stop this proposal immediately those of us involved in the long campaign against this incinerator had hoped a change of government would have brought a change of policy for dublin but unfortunately this is not to be
2153953 with modern technology such as mechanical biological treatment and greater recycling the argument for incineration lies in tatters this city faces a waste management crisis but to continue to bury and burn our waste is a deeply flawed and totally unacceptable policy we must rule out the option of incineration and invest in new technology and in a programme to reduce reuse and recycle our waste sinn f in will continue to stand by local communities and campaign with communities to implement a zero waste strategy for dublin it has become the only credible solution to the waste crisis
2153954 i have contacted the minister directly calling on him to rule out the proposed incinerator
2153955 now poling and healy are standard bearers for the poorly conceived hypothesis that children receive too many vaccines too early as a consequence some parents are choosing to delay withhold or separate vaccines
2153956 the public airing of that hypothesis caused thousands of parents to avoid the mmr many children were hospitalized and several died from measles as a result
2153957 to take another look at that hypothesis not deny it
2153958 a susceptible group does not mean that vaccines arent good
2153959 it is the job of the public health community and of physicians to be out there and to say yes we can make it safer because we are able to say this is a subset were going to deliver it in a way we think is safer
2153960 major studies that focus on 300 kids who got autistic symptoms within a period of a few weeks of getting a vaccine
2153961 i really take issue with that conclusion the reason they didnt want to look for those susceptibility groups was because if they found them that would scare the public away
2153962 populations do not test causality they test associations you have to go into the laboratory
2153963 the fact that there is concern that you dont want to know that susceptible group is a real disappointment to me
2153964 many in the autism community and their champions believe that the result in this case may well signify a landmark decision as it pertains to children developing autism following vaccinations this still remains to be seen but currently there are almost 5 000 other cases pending
2153965 i dont think you should ever turn your back on any scientific hypothesis because youre afraid of what it might show
2153966 you should n ever turn your back on any scientific hypothesis because youre afraid of what it might show
2153967 but studies of concomitant use which are required by the food and drug administration before licensure to show that new vaccines do not affect the safety or immunogenicity of existing vaccines or vice versa have clearly shown that multiple vaccines can be administered safely
2153968 manufacturers are required to submit the results of their own tests for potency safety and purity for each vaccine lot to the fda they are also required to submit samples of each vaccine lot to fda for testing however if the sponsor describes an alternative procedure which provides continued assurance of safety purity and potency cber may determine that routine submission of lot release protocols showing results of applicable tests and samples is not necessary
2153969 my information was based on a verbatim transcript of the dhhs concession which stated that his daughter had had frequent ear infections and a series of viral infections early in life
2153970 but studies of concomitant use which are required by the food and drug administration before licensure to show that new vaccines do not affect the safety or immunogenicity of existing vaccines or vice versa have clearly shown that multiple vaccines can be administered safely
2153971 im right you cannot be right because i am right therefore everyone who doesnt agree with me is wrong
2153972 current policies to tackle hiv aids in africa emphasise individual behaviour such as the abc approach to prevention abstain be faithful condomise however these measures require that people have hope for the future and goals to aim for and if wider economic and social circumstances are so poor that people lack hope for the future then these current policies will have limited success
2153973 hope is quite straightforward to measure via questionnaires and surveys can help to identify high risk environments
2153974 although there is not a great deal of experience in developing programmes to increase hope policies such as cash support for children microfinance for small businesses womens education reduced discriminations against sexual minorities and health system reform will improve the wider environment and with more to live for interventions to encourage individuals to change their behaviour are more likely to succeed
2153975 it gives us a starting population of cells that we can tailor to grow the tissue type or the organ we want to replace
2153976 it is early days but thats the big end goal
2153977 the good news is they can make every cell type the bad news is they can make every cell type
2153978 our problem has been that we cant really control them
2153979 its less about house prices and more about debt level
2153980 the proportion of homeowners that have no mortgage debt is higher there are smaller less expensive homes and older houses
2153981 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2153982 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2153983 he was living with me for three and a half months
2153984 he definitely had that stereotype about him like a german nazi
2153985 id be out of my mind as a criminal defense attorney
2153986 he denies any involvement or any knowledge of the sohuses disappearance
2153987 im sorry i dont speak a word of french and have no idea what youre saying
2153988 we initially wanted kirsty to be our flag bearer at the opening ceremony today but she is not in a position to do so because she is competing the following day tomorrow and she needs a rest and to concentrate on competing in her first event at the games on saturday
2153989 brian dzingai and lewis banda only arrived here in beijing today yesterday and im glad that they decided to join the rest of the team early
2153990 this shows total commitment on the part of these two athletes because the track and field competitions will only start on august 15
2153991 well no chance um well be spending our time um getting to the bottom of this person
2153992 well obviously representing your country at a major event such as the olympics is always a proud moment and i am looking forward to every minute of it
2153993 i know jelena is an amazing player but i will concentrate on my game as i have always done and the better player on the courts will carry the day
2153994 it is going to be a tough event as the field will comprise some of the worlds top players i just want to focus on my game and keep on the right track for a medal
2153995 the good thing is my fitness has improved and i am working hard to get into adequate form
2153996 crescent phase is where the starlight would be glancing off the edge of the planet toward our telescopes
2153997 that would be when the light is coming at the surface at a very steep angle and the spectacular reflection would be the strongest and most intense
2153998 researchers reported in a recent annals of behavioral medicine that tai chi movements helped seniors improve their physical functioning ninety six healthy but inactive adults ages 65 to 96 were assigned to either a 6 month tai chi class or a control group at the end of the study more than half of those enrolled in the tai chi class who had reported functional limitations at the start of the study indicated improvement this is consistent with other studies showing the benefits of tai chi for seniors most notably in reducing falls
2153999 but keep in mind even if you take a multi you still need to have a healthy balanced diet these pills are not magic bullets foods particularly fruits vegetables and whole grains provide fiber as well as countless beneficial phytochemicals not found in any pill
2154000 does your lifestyle really allow you to eat 6 11 servings of bread cereal and pasta and 5 9 servings of fruits and vegetables a day along with 2 3 servings of milk yogurt and cheese and the same amount of meat poultry fish or other protein foods
2154001 you should have a comprehensive dilated eye exam at least once a year your eye care professional can monitor your condition and check for other eye diseases you may also be advised to take the areds supplementation
2154002 it is not the critic who counts credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena
2154003 at this point i feel like ive said everything i can and i we need to simply ask god for a miracle ask him to change her heart
2154004 por fin todos juntos t puedes ser uno m s hazte socio
2154005 en total son cerca de 200 personas implicadas entre deportistas y personal de todo tipo todos con la misma equipaci n por lo que va a ser bastante espectacular
2154006 this is a distinct kind of physical connection between two compartments in a cell the cytoplasm and the nucleus
2154007 it really opens up the possibility that there is a basic process going on that affects gene expression in ways that we had not understood before
2154008 the proteins act like players in a game of tug of war
2154009 they will move side to side in an ordered line remaining standing as long as the teams are of similar strengths however once one team pulls with a force that cannot be countered by the second team both teams fall to the ground in a jumble
2154010 this communication is physical and it shows us how chromatin can support a cytoplasmic function while on the other hand microtubules have the ability to affect nuclear functions
2154011 personne ne peut vraiment se rendre compte de ce que ben a accompli en terme de jeu d criture de r alisation de production et de direction dans un film comme tropic thunder sans savoir que chacune de ces fonctions prise seule demande de travailler plein temps
2154012 the challenge of jesus rediscovering who jesus was and is
2154013 are far more comfortable and suitable to male anatomy than trousers or shorts because they dont confine the legs or cramp the male genitals the way that trousers or shorts do
2154014 she girimbabazi is making her third appearance at the olympic games and this was the only criteria taken while choosing the athlete to carry the national flag at tomorrows today opening ceremony
2154015 it is a great honour for me to carry the national flag at such an international and important event iam happy for having been chosen to lead the country
2154016 on verra bien si cest vrai quils ont de lhumour
2154017 on verra bien si cest vrai quils ont de lhumour
2154018 it is time for me to step down and choose the next emperor i have decided to choose one of you
2154019 i am going to give each one of you a seed today one very special seed i want you to plant the seed water it and come back here after one year from today with what you have grown from this one seed i will then judge the plants that you bring and the one i choose will be the next emperor
2154020 today one of you will be appointed the next emperor
2154021 the emperor knows im a failure maybe he will have me killed
2154022 one year ago today i gave everyone here a seed i told you to take the seed plant it water it and bring it back to me today but i gave you all boiled seeds which would not grow all of you except ling have brought me trees and plants and flowers when you found that the seed would not grow you substituted another seed for the one i gave you ling was the only one with the courage and honesty to bring me a pot with my seed in it therefore he is the one who will be the new emperor
2154023 on verra bien si cest vrai quils ont de lhumour
2154024 it was a balanced and good game but i observed that there was no creativity upfront there was also poor finishing in the attack which was responsible for our inability to convert chances into goals
2154025 the team must also improve on its midfield after that i see the boys going far in the competition
2154026 si pas is por la zona se alada comentarme si pod is observar el m s m nimo indicio de obra alguna desde octubre que fue adjudicada la obra y anunciada en los medios a bombo y platillo como la primera playa fluvial de pontevedra
2154027 cese inmediato de los vertidos de aguas residuales que se est n produciendo a las acequias de riego del chiribaile y exfiliana que riegan los campos del municipio
2154028 hes kind of brought a new life to our team
2154029 everybody on the bench is looser and having more fun
2154030 quaint quiet grave and simple and when one asks you a question or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply you rap out a round rejoinder which if not blunt is at least brusque
2154031 it does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior who cannot possibly intend to marry her and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them which if unreturned and unknown must devour the life that feeds it
2154032 there was hope in its aspect and life in its color
2154033 i must leave adele and thornfield i must part with you for my whole life i must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes
2154034 you think i have no feelings and that i can do without one bit of love and kindness but i cannot live so
2154035 we have sent them two letters already on this matter after the fifa ruling and we hope they will co operate with us
2154036 i think fifa will step in if they refuse him an opportunity to represent his country at a big stage like the olympics
2154037 i flew in from england just to sort everything out but they still wont budge
2154038 i quite understand the position of the club but this could be his only chance of playing at the olympics
2154039 we will continue to investigate the paranormal phenomenon recorded at the dauphine orleans in the hopes to unveil more psychic echoes from the past particularly our former female residents
2154040 i have done lots of farting in movies and ive been fat in almost all of my movies so its very close to home
2154041 the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other thats not to say it hasnt crossed my mind or stewarts or andys
2154042 karmically we deserve the right guy its a tough thing man we make a pretty big noise
2154043 its a new age young hip hop version of heat these are young cool well dressed articulate bank robbers chris brown be the little homey
2154044 contractions have their own rhythm right so we had to find our own rhythm to be a little bit above or on top of the contractions rhythm we had a good groove going
2154045 he volunteers at his local church coaches softball baseball and soccer he is taking xanax crestor and has nerve damage to his arm he takes percocet
2154046 as everybody knows brazil is located on the other side of the world
2154047 sometimes life can be really tricky you dont know what the future holds but like any army a good soldier must be ready
2154048 you go through so much to get here its a little heartbreaking
2154049 the last word from my federation about two weeks ago was that she was ok
2154050 and i was really happy because i know that she has been working so hard for four years i was really happy for her because i have been to two olympics
2154051 i am 50 percent sad 50 percent happy happy because my country my partner my coach and everybody believed in me and they waited for my last decision
2154052 she said i can play in the olympics but were going to go nowhere with me
2154053 i was completely focused on getting here rested and ready
2154054 juliana is my partner i think 50 percent for juliana and 50 percent for me but now ana paula is another 50 percent
2154055 there is more power in the sky it is bigger than me
2154056 claims in these various appeals fail because 1 they are barred by limitations 2 they are inadequately briefed or 3 they lack merit
2154057 paid sick days is a basic worker right just like being paid a decent wage
2154058 it was easier to get voted out of the old u s s r politburo than it is out of the california state legislature
2154059 i dont think our whole idea was so much to get it on this years ballot as it was to show people that there was a determination to have an alternative method to draw the state lines
2154060 i have been open and honest about my recovery while my speech continues to improve it is not yet 100 percent and i have not yet reached a point in my rehab where my participation in a debate would accurately reflect my capabilities
2154061 therefore i will not participate in traditional political debates during this campaign
2154062 the club felt that the duo lacked fitness and also lacked the technical skill to play at this level we thank both of them for coming out on trial with us but we believe the level is higher that they expected
2154063 whenever the name samora khulu is mentioned i am reminded of ellis park stadium he used to score goals every time we played there they were not ordinary goals but spectacular ones that you never see today
2154064 khulu was the best striker of the ball i have ever played with during my entire career our coach at the time joe frickleton used to call him zulu boy but we called him zb
2154065 he will always be in our memories may his soul rest in piece
2154066 i will wait to see how i feel because valverde freire or samuel sanchez could be better than me on the day and maybe i will have to work for them if so i will be glad to do it because the main objective is getting a medal for spain
2154067 it wont be a race only between spain and italy like they say it will were going to have to keep tabs on other opponents too

2154122 in the current deregulated telecommunications market our government has no intention of interfering with the day to day business decisions of private companies or with the choices available to consumers

2154124 murder kidnapping and inflicting bodily harm major u s presidential candidate senator barack obama
2154125 he hated george bush and he wants to take shot at the top of the head
2154126 if he wanted to kill senator obama it kills it is simply a sniper rifle
2154127 there have been no firm agreements or understandings or any kind of concerted work in this regard
2154128 the main thing to remember is that the negotiating track is open it is being pursued there are contacts between the parties of course some parties do raise the issue of sanctions from time to time
2154129 nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2154130 we became boyfriend and girlfriend the day we met he was on a quest to meet me and he was like i think youre beautiful and i really like you and i was like oh my gosh i like you so much
2154131 nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
2154132 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core i was rebelling against everything nick wanted me to be and then i was like ive got to be by myself for now and just figure out who i really am

2154146 today there is a conflict concrete information of what is really happening in iraq and in particular the form of picture that hit the recipient of internal and external another issue unifying political discourse and media events around the convention without making more than one party to talk about the agreement and therefore the iraqi people will be puzzled to go to learn from what is actually going on

2154163 that was a key catch to get the two outs with a runner on second the homer wasnt bad either
2154164 i was running in i wasnt sure i could get to it i dove for the ball ill take a great catch any day but a three run homer to center ill take that too the home run was pretty neat

2154172 step back from his day to day producing work on american idol
2154173 ive just decided to step back from the day to day running of american idol basically
2154174 you know what the schedule was like it was 24 7 and then some
2154175 i just needed a break to go and do something else basically
2154176 its such a wonderful team now everybody thank goodness knows what theyre doing
2154177 really im just such a control freak that i didnt always let them off the leash its still going to be just as good and just as strong as ever
2154178 coming to america was probably the most difficult decision youre giving up everything in your own country and trying to make a go of it in another country so that was probably the most difficult decision and that worked out so brilliantly ive decided im going to stay
2154179 we created it together and thats really pretty special for me to have those guys by my side the whole time because when i wrote the songs i was thinking about them
2154180 i was thinking about the way they play what theyre going to add to it the ideas they contribute that help make the song even better that stuff wouldnt be there if i was just hiring a band
2154181 it wasnt waving beautifully or anything it was just sort of flopping i took it down and picked up my guitar and just started strumming
2154182 i didnt know what next level meant but i knew that we wanted it
2154183 its exciting and scary but also rewarding its an interesting experience you should have if you get the opportunity so why the hell not

2154190 a former abortion clinic manager told me after she left the abortion business and became a christian that if even a few people were outside their clinic praying they would see a difference inside the clinic fewer women would keep their appointments and confusion would reign equipment would not work and workers would fight amongst themselves the presence of humble christians praying to a mighty god has an effect

2154227 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error or shortcoming but who knows the great enthusiasms the great devotions who spends himself for a worthy cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least he fails while daring greatly so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat
2154228 that shooting increased the awareness of security for government employees and buildings
2154229 the government will designate certain sites as critical infrastructures and they will be monitored for security by the pso officers

2154231 there is actually a lot of water in the northern basin and the government has a golden opportunity to buy that water
2154232 given the current level of storage its not feasible to refill the lakes by transferring water from other parts of the basin without any further significant rain
2154233 we note that murray darling basin commission figures released yesterday show that up to 80 per cent of water would be lost in transmission between the northern basin and the lower lakes
2154234 the water is available but we need the political will

2154245 until he is apprehended he continues to pose a threat not only to other potential buildings and property but also to the property and safety of friends and family members as well the reason for this is that under the right set of circumstances it is possible he could strike out unpredictably against someone he knows

2154254 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2154255 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2154256 the administrator didnt mention anything to the governor about the livestock industry
2154257 however is that the result of the renewable fuels standard mandate our conclusion is no
2154258 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2154259 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2154260 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate
2154261 continue to plan for and meet the fuel and food needs of the future
2154262 every independent study has confirmed that using corn to make this cheap clean american made fuel has no significant impact on food prices
2154263 i think it is an important step that the gravity of the situation has been recognized and that there are some steps in place to turn the tide in afghanistan
2154264 whether that is successful or not is of course an open question
2154265 in terms of milestones its important to point out that no casualty is more significant than any other
2154266 each service member is equally precious and each loss of life is equally tragic
2154267 the reported presence in afghanistan of the head of al qaida in iraq underscores the extent to which blowback from iraq is being felt in afghanistan
2154268 at this point leadership seems to be looking at the afghan theater as the next big thing
2154269 the size of the operation and the ability of the group to get support within the town was somewhat alarming and it shows that there is clearly some concern with local afghans and thats a concern because civilians are the center of gravity in a counterinsurgency
2154270 the dangerous message is that there was involvement by the civilians

2154274 the coalition further decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings the coalition leadership will present a charge sheet against gen musharraf
2154275 we hope that 90 percent of the lawmakers will support us
2154276 we have backed him and voted for him so we are duty bound to support him we will oppose impeachment
2154277 as we have consistently said these are internal issues to be resolved by the pakistani people
2154278 and our expectation would be that this will be resolved in a manner consistent with the rule of law and the pakistani constitution
2154279 there is a strong likelihood but not certainty that the ruling coalition can impeach him
2154280 the army would be crazy for doing that the army needs to improve its reputation and image with the people of pakistan

2154285 if this particular court case is upheld we will deploy that
2154286 if you talk to a bunch of lawyers this is a lot more complicated than the headlines appear
2154287 what matters to me is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2154288 its not serious to him that hes a criminal defendant this court should be outraged

2154314 sometimes when people come right up in your face and you think good god would you do that to anybody elses child thats all
2154315 whatever the proper resolution of the extraordinarily important questions presented the public interest clearly favors further consideration of issues before defendants are required to take actions that may forever alter the constitutional balance of separation of powers
2154316 this continuing contempt of congress is another example of the lengths to which this administration will go and how it uses government lawyers to protect its actions from scrutiny and increase its power rather than respect the rule of law

2154331 especially in a matter as high profile as this the court was disappointed that much of the testimony particularly as it related to public figures within the state of new jersey and the dirty laundry associated therewith needed to be aired in the public and in the press

2154365 nous regrettons quils ne soient pas parvenus terminer leur travail ur cette question
2154366 nous ne pensons pas que la probl me de kirkouk doit prendre en otage la loi lectorale
2154367 nous savons depuis juillet quil sera impossible de les tenir comme pr vu le 1er octobre si les d put s narrivent pas se mettre daccord dans les prochains jours ce sera de plus en plus difficile de les tenir dici la fin de lann e
2154368 lonu ne m nagera aucun effort pour que le scrutin se tienne cette ann e

2154373 en labsence de r ponse positive des iraniens loffre g n reuse que nous leur avons faite dans notre proposition de coop ration nous pensons que les alli s nauront pas dautres choix que de prendre de nouvelles mesures punitives
2154374 pas dautre choix que dappliquer de nouvelles sanctions lencontre de liran

2154380 when you come in at 500 600 mph drop a 500 pound bomb and then fly away you dont see what happens
2154381 you watch it all the way to impact and i mean its very vivid its right there and personal so it does stay in peoples minds for a long time
2154382 it is quite different going from potentially shooting a missile then going to your kids soccer game
2154383 you do stick around and see the aftermath of what you did and that does personalize the fight
2154384 you have a pretty good optical picture of the individuals on the ground the images can be pretty graphic pretty vivid and those are the things we try to offset we know that some folks have in some cases problems
2154385 no ones been naive enough to come in to interview but not know about that aspect of the job
2154386 theyre putting a missile down somebodys chimney and taking out bad guys and the next thing theyre taking their wife out to dinner their kids to school
2154387 a lot of them have told me im glad ive got the hour drive it gives them that whole amount of time to leave it behind
2154388 they get in their bus or car and they go into a zone they say for the next hour im decompressing im getting re engaged into what its like to be a civilian
2154389 we urge the chinese to do what other countries have done to sanction to put a financial squeeze on the burmese generals
2154390 while these camps are supposed to be temporary camps in reality some people have been living here for over 20 years some were born in the camps and now they have their own children
2154391 they are entirely dependent on handouts which is not good socially or psychologically
2154392 it is a protracted emergency which is hard to keep in the news but there is human rights abuse going on virtually every day in eastern myanmar
2154393 the noble cause has many devoted champions and i happen to be married to one
2154394 freedoms a scary thing for them and by them i mean the chinese communists
2154395 we just want to find the person and ask him to pay the bill

2154400 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2154401 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2154402 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2154403 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2154404 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2154405 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2154406 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2154407 georgia will not yield its territory or renounce its freedom
2154408 the georgian leadership should come to their senses and return to civilized ways of resolving difficult issues
2154409 we think that this is a very serious error of judgement and political blunder
2154410 i hope that the georgian side will reconsider its reckless actions in the area of the georgia south ossetia conflict
2154411 any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs
2154412 the chinese government puts people first and is dedicated to maintaining and promoting its citizens basic rights and freedom
2154413 chinese citizens have freedom of religion these are indisputable facts
2154414 change in china will arrive on its own terms and in keeping with its own history and its own traditions
2154415 yet change will arrive and it will be clear for all to see that those who aspire to speak their conscience and worship their god are no threat to the future of china
2154416 it is a commitment to strengthen that foundation for years to come

2154467 rural and remote health services have been under funded and under resourced for long time and have not gotten the same attention that occurs in urban areas
2154468 in times of extreme weather conditions an important rural service like the australian royal flying doctors service may find it hard to reach people

2154486 the word survey is possibly a misnomer as the information gathered is self selected by vendors submitting their own figures on company growth and revenue

2154591 youll be walking through the barrens an area in wow and youll see a steam tank drive past you with five people sitting in it or youll see a death knight clad in frozen armor with five ghouls walking behind him this stuff is wrath only after seeing that who wouldnt want the expansion
2154592 they took it up a notch with the complexity of the scenes and the intricacy
2154593 they have some areas which are now misty which is a really interesting effect walking through a mist previously they had sort of grayed out the scene and called it mist but now its hard to peer through
2154594 theyve again taken the end game and made it more accessible to more people
2154595 without costing the high end players without giving up the challenge that keeps the high end players motivated
2154596 i think blizzard has learned a lot from the last expansion release
2154597 even a group of ten people will be able to conquer the very highest end game content while 25 man versions will let people who want to be more hardcore do that as well
2154598 if youre familiar with the mechanics of the 10 person version
2154599 then you should be familiar with the 25 person version at least in the philosophical sense

2154613 we are disappointed at nices view that although these drugs are clinically effective their high price means that they are not considered to be value for money for the nhs
2154614 this decision once again raises questions about whether nices system of appraisal is appropriate for all types of drugs it is often difficult to get unequivocal research data in rarer cancers such as metastatic kidney cancer which have a small patient population although we understand that nice often has to make difficult decisions in this case there is a clear separation between what nice finds to be valuable treatment and clinical and patient opinion action is needed to bring these two positions closer together
2154615 possible solutions include looking at the way that pharmaceutical companies are charging the nhs for drugs and whether appropriate allowances are being made by nice to compensate for the lack of large scale trials in these areas we also need to ensure that further results are sought and that larger trials in addition to the nine studies supported by cancer research uk are carried out
2154616 in the last maybe 10 15 years we had reached pretty much a bottleneck in resolution and efficiency

2154643 we are happy to share with the world in these joyful moments but i am sad to see the big teams of many countries while our country is left behind with one of the smallest teams in the olympics
2154644 we had hoped that our country will participate with a large team in order to get good results in the games our interest in the olympics would have been greater
2154645 anyhow i will try not to miss the events they are in
2154646 we have waiting eagerly for this world event in iraq we are in desperate need for such issues in order to entertain ourselves and forget the miseries
2154647 if we add all radiation leaked at every japanese port it would be still smaller than the amount of naturally occurring radioactivity found inside home smoke detectors
2154648 japan also has found no abnormality in its monitoring results during houstons port calls since june 2006
2154649 we highly value our relationship with beyonc it is categorically untrue that lor al paris altered her features or skin tone in the campaign for feria hair color
2154650 or you end up falling victim to these types of situations
2154651 she has never been in any trouble besides this that doesnt mean she didnt do what was alleged
2154652 but she didnt get a fair trial and everyone has a right to a fair trial
2154653 im just trying to control myself because if you dont you go crazy
2154654 if you dont look at it at 6 in the morning they will come get you by surprise
2154655 there is a big turnover and it is more difficult for us to provide individual and personal help
2154656 is legitimate defense since they migrants are locked up and innocent
2154657 self mutilation suicide attempts hunger strikes starting fires are frequent
2154658 pressure on foreigners and the increasing reduction in their rights generates a feeling of humiliation anxiety and revolt
2154659 ultra slim silicone case for the iphone 3g review and contest
2154660 no i got the point i just think its a stupid one is all this scenario i can see all ready is going to digress into name calling and all the other bs and frankly it is going to make all the organizations on both sides look like fools to the public and the public is going to be just as if not more so confused as they are right now
2154661 its really exciting that the tdhb have agreed to come on board and support our project the growing support for the film really shows how local organisations and businesses are keen to help out and be involved with the community
2154662 this is going to take a long time to get together as people are so busy this time of year
2154663 but in saying that it means more time can be spent on detail editing and preparation which will mean a better quality production

2154669 hay personas que no pueden dormir hasta las cuatro de la ma ana
2154670 se desmarca de las manifestaciones ocurridas durante la noche de ayer
2154671 i have been consistent on this point from the beginning
2154672 this is what i believed but now i see a better way so i have changed my mind
2154673 she said when i do it with everyone im exhausted and it hurts but when i do it myself its easy
2154674 youre focusing on the music rather than your breathing or what youre doing
2154675 if youre just making sure you get 45 or 60 minutes of aerobic exercise in to burn calories you want to distract yourself youre not even thinking about exercise and all of a sudden youre done
2154676 there can be no question china has achieved something truly special
2154677 you mean they got someone in your office who can speak the language
2154678 she simply refused to follow the sacred no laughing rule as i spoke
2154679 it used to be jammu amp kashmir now its jammu vs kashmir
2154680 the land issue is now symbolic and its the issue of our dignity as in the past 60 years
2154681 but by trying to choke us economically theyre proving it was only a marriage of convenience we too dont want them anymore
2154682 we cannot think of a better day to celebrate the beginning of a happy new family and the happiest moment for our country these two things should go hand in hand
2154683 we will always choose a lucky date for important events such as giving birth in the year of the pig or getting married or starting a new business venture on a prosperous date
2154684 if it werent for today we would have chosen valentines day to get married
2154685 chinese people always believe in the lucky number eight but there have also been many tragedies in 2008
2154686 recently our mission about the importance of vaccines has become difficult as a result there is an outbreak of measles people read misinformation on the internet but its just not true
2154687 im here because there seems to be a rift between the medical community and parents
2154688 it makes absolutely no sense for parents to feel that there is this massive cover up about the safety of vaccines there are people presenting this as a controversy when they shouldnt
2154689 i believe in my heart that my use of the word parasites was mean and divisive i completely understand why it offended some parents and in particular parents of children with autism who feel that vaccines caused their illness for this i am truly sorry
2154690 dont listen to actors about this dont listen to celebrities about this listen to the doctors and scientists who know what they are doing
2154691 i want to make this clear this is not about me im not in line with jenny mccarthy or dr offit im a spokesperson for the data
2154692 i think there are some misunderstandings about what makes something toxic mercury is everywhere but at what point does something become toxic parents shouldnt just believe that because there are certain ingredients in a vaccine that it is harmful you have to ask yourself what does a trace of mercury mean then get the right information so that you can understand why vaccines do have certain ingredients in them
2154693 mercury is everywhere but at what point does something become toxic parents shouldnt just believe that because there are certain ingredients in a vaccine that it is harmful
2154694 you have to ask yourself what does a trace of mercury mean then get the right information so that you can understand why vaccines do have certain ingredients in them
2154695 where is the study that demonstrates that mercury at trace levels is safe
2154696 why do vaccines have mercury in them when there are other non toxic preservatives that can be used
2154697 louise it was worse than the ama seminar we attended
2154698 i arrived at the gramercy room on the third floor of the peninsula hotel walked up to the first person i saw stuck out my hand and introduced myself
2154699 during the q amp a i didnt say a thing louise not one thing there was too much to say how do i break through when their ears and eyes are closed to all that we see and hear how do i communicate in a sound bite world
2154700 louise kuo habakus believes that there is no single issue affecting our nations children that is more important than mandatory vaccination and its myriad societal political medical and financial ramifications
2154701 this is a 15 year scandal born of ignorance and inertia
2154702 we now know that millions of women might have been spared hiv unwanted pregnancies and empowered themselves in the process if they had access to this simple method
2154703 this pushed georgia into a philosophy of self reliance the idea that georgia will be able to regain breakaway entities only by its own means
2154704 the elephant in the room behind this whole story is georgias nato prospects
2154705 it might be a signal to the russians saying that the sochi olympics will not go the way russia wants if there is no progress on the settlement in abkhazia
2154706 sudan is my country sudan is the country of my grandmother and grandfather sudan will always be my home
2154707 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record
2154708 but from this there have been positives as the attention of the world is now on china and their human rights record is in the spotlight
2154709 he wanted to live in the big country and maybe get famous now that i see all this hes really famous
2154710 there is a pending investigation to determine who this guy is
2154711 i recall him thinking hes better than the rest of us
2154712 i recall him telling stories about having servants growing up and like that
2154713 intense fighting is going on between soldiers and taliban since friday morning
2154714 if therefore the light that is in thee be darkness how great is that darkness
2154715 these things i command you that ye love one another if the world hate you ye know that it hated me before it hated you if ye were of the world the world would love his own but because ye are not of the world but i have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you remember the word that i said unto you the servant is not greater than his lord if they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if they have kept my saying they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my names sake because they know not him that sent me if i had not come and spoken unto them they had not had sin but now they have no cloke for their sin he that hateth me hateth my father also
2154716 these things i have spoken unto you that in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer i have overcome the world
2154717 it did not take much reading in gods word for the veil to be lifted off my eyes and for the truth to finally shine through
2154718 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it
2154719 for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works lest any man should boast for we are his workmanship created in christ jesus unto good works which god hath before ordained that we should walk in them
2154720 not by works of righteousness which we have done but according to his mercy he saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the holy ghost which he shed on us abundantly through jesus christ our saviour that being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life
2154721 it is not the critic who counts credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena
2154722 dr bernadine healy former head of nih current member of the iom says that the epidemiological studies used to disprove a connection between vaccines and autism are useless and that fellow colleagues on the iom have explicitly said that they dont want to look because theyre afraid of what they might find comments
2154723 offit is oz amanda the man behind the curtain with no magical powers over the behavior of toxins and live viruses
2154724 usually simultaneous vaccination is incompletely studied at time of licensure
2154725 we speak out for a free press freedom of assembly and labor rights not to antagonize chinas leaders but because trusting its people with greater freedom is the only way for china to develop its full potential
2154726 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
2154727 we firmly oppose any words or acts that interfere in other countries internal affairs using human rights and religion and other issues
2154728 we strongly believe societies which allow the free expression of ideas tend to be the most prosperous and the most peaceful
2154729 were working with apple to get netshare back up on the app store
2154730 theyve raised awareness in the marketplace about what smart phones can do
2154731 he thinks its some kind of game for him im very angry with him ive had a partnership with black hat for three years
2154732 the design of the network was to isolate it from the rest of the public network its not designed to isolate it from one computer in the press room to another computer in the press room
2154733 it gives us a starting population of cells that we can tailor to grow the tissue type or the organ we want to replace
2154734 it is early days but thats the big end goal
2154735 the good news is they can make every cell type the bad news is they can make every cell type
2154736 our problem has been that we cant really control them
2154737 which disease would you rather get i may be paraphrasing a bit
2154738 one thing most people dont realize it is not the number of shots vaccines but the number of antigens received according to dr sherri tenpenny kids received a total of 113 vaccine antigens by kindergarten in approx 33 shots
2154739 every baby deserves to keep the health they were born with
2154740 i have confirmed we have no relationship with ecbt we have not supported any of their programs
2154741 ninty seven plus percent of children dont have these defects so when you look at what the risk and the benefits to children are and you really weigh the risks then the benefits far outweigh the risks that occur
2154742 that would be news to me let me ask one person and ill get back to you for now that would be a false rumor
2154743 vaccines are the bedrock of expanded illnesses skyrocketing medical costs and exponential drug sales but it is more than individual vaccines that are cause for concern the sheer number of vaccines children now receive between birth and six years of age is staggering and include diphtheria a rare throat infection pertussis and tetanus the dtap shot haemophilus influenza type b the hib vaccine measles mumps and rubella the mmr shot pneumococcus the prevnar vaccine polio three strains rotavirus five strains and individual vaccines for hepatitis a hepatitis b chickenpox and meningitis flu shots three strains are now given annually beginning at six months of age that adds up to 113 vaccine antigens by kindergarten given in about 33 shots
2154744 parents are becoming wary of the many needles being jabbed into their precious babies at the tender age of two four and six months in response the drug companies are combining several vaccines into a single injection comvax hepatitis b and hib proquad mmr and chickenpox pediarix dtap polio and hepatitis b and two newly approved vaccines kinrix dtap and polio and pentacel dtap polio and hib have been developed parents are deceived into believing that the combination shots are fewer vaccines they are not the number of jabs is reduced but the number of antigen doses remains the same
2154745 im here to tell you to not listen to the celebrities dont believe them but im a celebrity and you can believe me
2154746 meanwhile out on the street parents were amiably chatting with police officers assigned to protect rosalyn carter from us they were all so kind and sympathetic horrified to hear the stories of our kids they all knew someone with an autistic child even the cameramen and women from various news outlets got involved asking us questions wanting to know where they could learn more european passerbys were in disbelief that so many vaccines are mandated in this country and were unfamiliar with autism no doubt why sure one or two people disagreed with us but we were happy to engage with them there was no yelling just a calm civilized discussion nothing to be so afraid about
2154747 these people are very nice people not the rabid baby killing foaming at the mouth crazies that offit and peet and the rest of the vaccine crowd say they are whats the deal here
2154748 we are not medical doctors so please consult your childs doctor before immunization
2154749 ninty seven plus percent of children dont have these defects so when you look at what the risk and the benefits to children are and you really weigh the risks then the benefits far outweigh the risks that occur
2154750 rene jenkins statement on vaccine safety and the charge that vaccines play a role in autism ninty seven plus percent of children dont have these defects so when you look at what the risk and the benefits to children are and you really weigh the risks then the benefits far outweigh the risks that occur
2154751 personally my inner knowing says whats going to do it is by americans being terrified to vaccinate
2154752 letzte woche um diese zeit kamen alle zum berraschungs poltern vorbei
2154753 so youre pretty much awesome and i want to say
2154754 it sure is nice having a little more time on my hands and id love to spend some of it with you would you like to join me for dinner
2154755 my staff has been calling this my retirement dinner not because im retiring of course but because were working on retiring the debt we owe to small vendors all over the country
2154756 lets go to dinner every little bit helps and even 5 can make a real difference
2154757 please take my voice with you to africa and on to mexico city for the international aids conference to speak for the millions living with hiv aids and malaria who desperately need lifesaving treatment and for the countless people living in rural areas who do not have access to adequate health care
2154758 it takes you back to a very ugly time in history in texas when we killed people because of the color of their skin and their poverty
2154759 the sovereignty issue is very big for the iraqis and we understand that but we are losing patience
2154760 the process needs to get moving and get moving quickly
2154761 this move is meant to offer an incentive for the foreign forces to withdraw
2154762 the special cells of fighters will not strike against foreign forces until the situation becomes clear vis a vis the iraq u s agreement on the presence of american forces here
2154763 we are here because china is the main supporter of the military regime
2154764 we want the chinese government to understand the actual cost of their support to the people inside of burma
2154765 china can help our democratization process by putting pressure on the military regime
2154766 we will never forget we will never give up 1988
2154767 ive totally lost hope that change will come through mass protests
2154768 its difficult to organize protests now because most of the leaders are in jail or in hiding
2154769 i cannot participate the way i did in 1988 i am older now and have a family to take care of
2154770 those were the days and i dont expect demonstrations of that scale to ever take place again in the country
2154771 a lot of people are saying what has gone wrong
2154772 we have found that more customers than ever before want to jump in a car with the family and avoid the hassle and increased costs of an overseas break
2154773 if we dont do this the deer will go extinct forever
2154774 somebody needs to bring them back they are a missing piece of the ecosystem
2154775 in the end it will complement the system and benefit the conservation of the whole wildlife area
2154776 some have been taken by leopards but that is a function of the ecosystem
2154777 when i confronted her with that she pulled a knife and threatened to kill me thats when i made arrangements to get the kids out
2154778 we are shocked by this terrible tragedy and our hearts go out to ingrid riveras family and friends we are grateful to the new york police department for arresting a suspect in this crime we continue to cooperate with police and answer any questions they may have
2154779 we are planning to conduct a full and thorough investigation
2154780 we were harmed by the very people who took an oath to protect us
2154781 they were the reason we bought this house because it had a big yard for them to run in
2154782 cheye and trinity we support you friends and citizens of berwyn heights
2154783 i was completely stunned because those dogs didnt hurt anybody they barely bark
2154784 she gave me a big hug and she said if the police shot your dogs dead and did this to you how can i trust them
2154785 i dont want people to feel like that i just want them to be proud of our police and proud to live in prince georges county
2154786 due to the increased level of extremist activity targeting individuals involved in biomedical research in recent months our first concern is for our employees and the animals we care for at charles river
2154787 usda did open an inquiry when we filed a complaint
2154788 their statement about fears for their own safety is absurd
2154789 they have an abysmal record of animal care as usual they are more interested in their reputation than in the animals safety
2154790 that monkeys were literally cooked to death by a heating system failure as a whistleblower alleges shows that the facility did not even have a simple alarm system in place to alert staff to the malfunction
2154791 current guidelines for physical activity recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity exercise such as brisk walking on most days of the week previous guidelines recommended vigorous activity such as jogging or cycling for at least 20 minutes three times a week to lower heart disease risk
2154792 exercise is essential for reducing the risk of osteoporosis and heart disease in post menopausal women
2154793 it is essential that women exercise moderately before and during the onset of menopause argues dr birch post menopause the loss of the hormone oestrogen results in a reversal of the protective effects womens bone mineral density begins to decrease their arteries begin to become stiffer their cholesterol levels begin to rise and their risk of becoming diabetic increases these physiological changes are much slower in women who participated in an active lifestyle prior to the menopause than in those who were inactive
2154794 his motivation in doing it was to play the futures market so that after the pipeline blew up and the price of oil increased he could make whatever profit on it
2154795 that shows at least in his mind that it was going to be a significant enough impact to affect the financial markets in a way that he would enrich himself
2154796 on its face it sounds like an extremely serious charge on the other hand the only person who had the capability of carrying out this scheme was a convicted felon government informant working with atf
2154797 all of the activity in the united states was to be carried out by the government informant and all of this happened with the governments knowledge
2154798 miss olsen na rien voir avec les drogues retrouv es et a d j fourni des informations importantes dans le cadre de lenqu te

2154805 while the court has previously declined to comment on defendant globes filings with this court its response brief and brief in support of cross motion consists of a series of stream of consciousness run on sentences riddled with spelling and grammar errors which the court deems wholly inappropriate to file in any court or proceeding

2154810 weve got to get out of the habit of thinking we only need to focus on improving the technology that we can invent our way out of this situation
2154811 weve got to do everything we can think of including reducing the size of the task by real conservation
2154812 to push and pull improved technologies and greener alternative fuels into the market place in high volume
2154813 require auto manufacturers to make smaller more fuel efficient cars encourage consumers to chose those vehicles and discourage everyone from driving so much
2154814 offers a path for continuous improvements in vehicle efficiency for the next few decades
2154815 offer a promising path to cost effective reduction in fuel use
2154816 their impact on fuel use and emissions is unlikely to be significant over the next few decades
2154817 fleet fuel use responds with a lag time of some 10 years to changes in the new vehicle market
2154818 transitioning from our current situation onto a path with declining fuel consumption and emissions even in the developed world will take several decades much longer than we hoped and realized

2154849 the evidence is clearly not there to support the notion of routine ecgs for children being put on adhd medications
2154850 we are very clear in saying no we do not believe your child should have an ecg
2154851 we say it is reasonable to add an ecg but it is not mandatory
2154852 if youre a pediatric cardiologist and youre seeing patients with adhd it would seem very reasonable to include an electrocardiogram to look for unsuspected abnormalities
2154853 there are no widely accepted recommendations or standards of care for cardiac monitoring on stimulant medications

2154890 free trade today is no longer driven by comparative advantage rather the ability to maximise profits by cutting costs
2154891 the cost advantage enjoyed by many developing countries is so great that it has been impossible for many manufacturing industries in the industrialised west to compete
2154892 actions like this have long run consequences it means divers have to dive more often and look longer to catch their legal limit
2154893 gospel truths are known and understood only by the power of the spirit eternal life which is to know god is such an infinitely great reward that men must study ponder and pray with all their hearts to gain the needed knowledge

2154900 generally your employer takes money out of your paycheck every month on an after tax basis and every six months uses whats accumulated to buy you stock at a discount usually around 15 percent in six months your 1 000 will buy you 1 200 worth of stock so youve already made money

2154938 stress is an incredible asset that stretches capacity and fuels creativity

2154948 the bad news is tidal turbines cant be as big as wind turbines
2154949 but the good news is that they dont need to be
2154950 tides are not driven by weather but instead by the relative motion of the moon sun and earth
2154951 you can predict what the tides will be 20 years ahead whereas you cant tell if it will be windy
2154952 the whole point is to put these things in the most energetic environments

2154988 with almost every child who comes to us the problem is self esteem they have been told they are naughty and end up believing it
2154989 when they are here we give them a structure there are consequences for everything they do if they dont do as they are told or they misbehave they know they will not get a lunch break or will get detention we remind them they have a choice
2154990 we can make a big impact on the children its true that we do have a lot of resources and a lot more time to work with the pupils than a mainstream school where a teacher has to struggle with a class of 30 others but the sooner we can work with a pupil the more progress can be made
2154991 prus have got a very bad reputation even among other schools
2154992 they think we are about taking the children mountaineering and colouring in we do cover the curriculum and target improving childrens literacy and numeracy but our focus is on changing their behaviour
2154993 the children are here to learn but we want them to stand up on their own and to be able to go back to their old school and get on and make friends
2154994 we are helping the schools look at behaviour in different way you cant shout at the children any more you need a new strategy it seems to be taboo for teachers to say we need help in dealing with a particular child
2154995 we have said to the schools we work with that its better to send children to us at the age of six when they begin to show difficult behaviour before leaving it two years and they are being expelled
2154996 we generally see about a 100 percent increase in recycling in mid to affluent neighborhoods
2154997 in lower income neighborhoods it can be up to 1 000 percent because the recycling rates are so low there
2154998 if you think about solar or wind power or buying a hybrid theyre very important but today theyre not something thats accessible to the average person
2154999 i look at recycling as the average thing that every person and household can do

2155010 the most important thing is to keep people that are lending to fannie and freddie comfortable lending
2155011 they really needed to do that in this market with the private mortgage market basically against the wall they needed to step in and do this this is exactly the sort of circumstances that fannie and freddie were created to deal with in the first place
2155012 oh absolutely not the unique part is this these guys are highly leveraged ive heard numbers of 100 to 1
2155013 well lets say people start getting nervous lets say that they think that there is a possibility that maybe there is such trouble that even if the government promises to help stabilize the situation it wont pan out people could think they just wont have the cash to do it i mean youve got 5 trillion of debt there and obviously not all of that is bad probably a minute portion of that but nonetheless a minute portion of bad debt in that size portfolio with that kind of leverage ratio can be real bad so then it becomes a question of gee should i become a little cautious lending to them and that simply means that people that lend to fannie and freddie bond investors expect a higher premium over the treasury bill and if they demand that higher premium that means that mortgage rates go up thats the big issue
2155014 its all totally hypothetical we just havent been here before this is the first time fannie and freddie have been in significant trouble since they spun off

2155021 we need laws that specify and limit the conditions for bail outs
2155022 rather than circuitously through the central bank as was done during the blow up of bear stearns
2155023 our country has long since abandoned the notion that we should leave crises to be resolved solely by the marketplace
2155024 the critical need is to formalise the procedures improvised in the case of bear stearns this should ensure that in the future government financial assistance to lending institutions does not impact the federal reserves balance sheet and monetary policy
2155025 several months ago we were nervous about the impact of the financial crisis but it does not seem to have been a major impediment

2155032 which he promised beforehand through his prophets the gospel concerning his son who was descended from david
2155033 now after john was arrested jesus came to galilee proclaiming the good news of god and saying the time is fulfilled and the kingdom of god has come near repent and believe in the good news
2155034 and he called his disciples to surrender themselves to him in self denial so they could follow him mark 8 34
2155035 for i will not venture to speak of anything except what christ has accomplished through me to win obedience from the gentiles by word and deed by the power of signs and wonders by the power of the spirit of god so that from jerusalem and as far around as illyricum i have fully proclaimed the good news of christ
2155036 in him you also when you had heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and had believed in him were marked with the seal of the promised holy spirit this is the pledge of our inheritance toward redemption as gods own people to the praise of his glory
2155037 but if it is by the spirit of god that i cast out demons then the kingdom of god has come to you
2155038 in former generations this mystery was not made known to humankind as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the spirit that is the gentiles have become fellow heirs members of the same body and sharers in the promise in christ jesus through the gospel

2155041 consistent positive associations between maternal nut product consumption such as peanut butter during pregnancy and wheeze dyspnea shortness of breath steroid use doctor diagnosed asthma and persistent wheeze in children from 1 to 8 years of age
2155042 if you say avoid nuts in children and for nursing mothers because peanut protein can be transferred through milk do we need to take it a step further and limit nuts during pregnancy
2155043 the associations we found are pretty strong only we are the first to find these effects so they need to be confirmed by other studies before recommending the avoidance of peanuts and nuts during pregnancy
2155044 this subject definitely needs further investigation and if you can pass on the antibodies that cause nut allergy from mother to fetus why not other allergies as well

2155049 consumers can suffer unnecessary harm when they choose plans that have higher fees than their original 401 k plans
2155050 people who leave the federal service are welcome to leave their retirement funds with us and we actually encourage them to do so because the tsp has one very big advantage over virtually all private sector plans and that is a tremendously attractive fee structure
2155051 tiaa cref regrets any misunderstanding that may have been caused by a recent advertisement directed toward thrift savings plan tsp participants
2155052 fidelitys rollover ira offers investors extensive investment flexibility with no additional account fee the extra convenience of aggregating retirement assets and financial guidance services
2155053 because each investor has unique needs fidelity offers one on one consultation to help better identify options for employees who have left their jobs as well as to help them understand the potential impact of each choice they may be considering
2155054 i applaud decision to pull the ads and am disappointed that fidelity has not chosen to follow suit
2155055 the tsp has the lowest administrative costs of any retirement program in the country and i think these misleading ads are a disservice to hard working public servants

2155059 weve been able to keep a good separation between monetary policy and these other areas
2155060 thats the way to destroy the federal reserve in the long run
2155061 if the fed and the treasury can commit 30 billion of taxpayer money to enable the takeover of bear stearns by jpmorgan chase then surely they can step in to enable working families to achieve the dream of a higher education for their children
2155062 it gets close to the idea of credit allocation and every fed chairman without exception worried about that
2155063 regardless of whether that window is officially opened or closed the market now assumes that it will be opened if necessary on an ad hoc basis
2155064 its getting into areas that are not typically thought to require the degree of independence that monetary policy does
2155065 the fed is the only agency that has the power to serve as a liquidity provider of last resort a power that has proved critical in financial crises throughout history
2155066 shirlington limousine and abramoff have been linked to the investigation by fired us attorney for maryland thomas dibiagio of the use of prostitutes by the office of then maryland republican governor bob ehrlich jr dibiagio based in baltimore was fired after his investigation leap frogged well beyond the business of the pamela martin amp associates escort service and into the activities of ehrlich and his staff
2155067 when he came into the weavers to replace pete seeger which was a pretty tall order he not only did that but he brought so much of his own talents to bear that it was overwhelming it really was
2155068 he was an absolutely logical person to be brought in
2155069 of the next generation of weavers i mean he was so outstanding that it was hard then or even now to imagine who else we could have brought in other than erik

2155081 the olympics are serving as just another springboard for her to see first hand her native country
2155082 we will be glued to the tv watching all of the events and are looking forward to seeing some of the background stories about china customs food living conditions
2155083 we arent using the olympics as a way to teach chinese culture per se
2155084 we try to weave authentic cultural experiences into our daily lives that said the positive images of china and its people is very important to her and she is feeling quite proud of being chinese the focus on china makes conversations about culture tradition and different ways of doing things more top of mind and universal
2155085 i think its a really great opportunity for our children to see china is a very positive light and feel good about that connection and their heritage
2155086 our cultural connection will be simple low key and naturally part of our everyday life pride making but not too much rah rah rah
2155087 i asked my kids not too long ago who they were going to be rooting for

2155106 if keeping a professional secret serves only yourself and harms others you should tell

2155165 if you carry on this kind of business i think its time for a change
2155166 i will tell you the vast majority of them dont understand it

2155183 if it is a genuine document which i do not believe at this time i would have to assume that it had been doctored to appear to be a bad forgery

2155283 theyre looking down deeper and deeper into what may be the most fundamental particles of the universe
2155284 we know were not there yet we know protons are made up of other small things the idea is to find out about those small things
2155285 the debris of those collisions only lasts for a very short amount of time so they have to have extremely sophisticated detectors to take a look at these things a fraction of a fraction of a second

2155442 naive you dont broadcast that you are going to bomb a country that is a sovereign nation and that you are dependent on the good will of the people of that country to help you in the war in the struggle against taliban and the sanctuaries which they hold
2155443 there are terrorists holed up in those mountains who murdered 3 000 americans they are plotting to strike again

2155449 working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success
2155450 at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election
2155451 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views were respected
2155452 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great
2155453 since the delegate count is so close what if you are called up for nomination and what if you do win by a narrow margin
2155454 that is not going to happen not going to happen look what we want to have happen is for sen obama to be nominated by a unified convention of democrats
2155455 the best way i think and i could be wrong but the best way i think to do that is to have a strategy so that my delegates feel like theyve had a role and that their legitimacy has been validated and that kind of you know there is a catharsis
2155456 i have said repeatedly that i will do whatever sen obama asks me to do
2155457 i am really focused and enjoying being back in the senate and working on behalf of my new york constituents this is sen obamas decision and his alone and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2155458 his policies have weakened the federation and eroded the trust of the nation in national institutions
2155459 the coalition further decided that it will immediately initiate impeachment proceedings the coalition leadership will present a charge sheet against gen musharraf
2155460 we hope that 90 percent of the lawmakers will support us
2155461 we have backed him and voted for him so we are duty bound to support him we will oppose impeachment
2155462 there is a strong likelihood but not certainty that the ruling coalition can impeach him
2155463 the army would be crazy for doing that the army needs to improve its reputation and image with the people of pakistan

2155466 we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party is fully unified heading into the november election
2155467 while no decisions have been made yet i will make sure that we keep you up to date and involved with all of the convention activity
2155468 i dont think were looking for catharsis i think what were looking for is energy and excitement
2155469 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee
2155470 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2155471 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2155472 the claims are high because people are coming into the system who probably would not have filed absent this program
2155473 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2155474 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind sen obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go
2155475 we are working together to make sure the fall campaign and the convention are a success at the democratic convention we will ensure that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected and our party will be fully unified heading into the november election

2155508 se n o h persist ncia em manter a correc o do portugu s por parte dos encarregados de educa o e dos professores os alunos tendem a enveredar por essa linguagem

2155528 we need to change the ways we grow distribute and eat food which needs to be good clean and fair things are at a crisis point with respect to health and the environment
2155529 a big message of slow food nation is that we all need to be planting gardens
2155530 we need to have more greenhouses in the future whether it gets too hot or too cold
2155531 slow food is the opposite of fast food it is food that comes from local sustainable farms
2155532 we intend to raise awareness about the profound effects of our food choices on the environment on our health and on issues of social justice
2155533 the current industrial model will soon fail for its heavy dependency on homogeneity and petroleum as such slow food is about survival

2155541 we continue the transition of the jones soda co started in 2007 in what is described as a difficult economic period
2155542 we continue to learn and adjust our perspective and sharpen our tactics to increase sales and margin at the same time
2155543 our second quarter performance was highlighted by the ongoing rollout of 24c across north america through our dsd network and the relisting of multiple jones soda skus in a majority of target locations
2155544 in addition concentrate sales to national beverage increased 34 due primarily to shipments in preparation for the launch of jones cola jones sugar free cola and jones lemon lime
2155545 we also shipped our traditional flavours during the quarter we did experience some softness in our core bottle business during the second quarter but are pleased with bottle performance in key markets
2155546 while we are pleased with progress on many fronts we increased promotion allowances and slotting fees in order to support the new can presence and bolster the bottle business
2155547 this had a negative impact on our net sales and profitability we believe these key expenditures will result in greater awareness of our beverages and a stronger market position for our company

2155556 you know for your information im actually based in the uk and let me tell you this even the forensic work in the uk does not work like what you see on tv for one thing tv always exaggerates situations and one other thing uks forensic science is far more superior than the us
2155557 you mean what theyre showing on the tv show is not real
2155558 not all of it they do reflect some of the proper processes but in all honesty its never that fast or miraculous

2155588 i dont think that its a secret that weve worked hard on our offensive scheme
2155589 there are going to be some things that are different in that area we had a lot of ground to cover in a short period of time this spring and we wanted to limit the amount of outside distractions to our players i was very pleased with the way things went overall
2155590 i was very happy with our spring our players concentrated very hard and went to work and i thought our coaches did a terrific job teaching
2155591 ive been around west point now four full years and ive seen things have success
2155592 i was comfortable with our old offense but i felt like some things needed to change to give us an opportunity to win thats our number one goal here to win i feel like this is the right move to help us best in the long run
2155593 we studied long and hard and spoke with a number of brilliant football people as we went through the process this winter
2155594 i was very pleased with the results we saw from our players this spring
2155595 a lot of people focused on what we were doing offensively this spring
2155596 but we had a lot of work to do on defense as well we lost an awful lot of talent and an awful lot of game experience on that side of the ball
2155597 our players needed a lot of reps both on offense and on defense
2155598 it was imperative that they got to see things that our opponents were going to be doing against them in the fall
2155599 those players are as important to our success as any of the starters on the team we cant get any better if we dont get the proper looks in practice i was so proud of our guys for doing that
2155600 were approaching this season with one goal in mind and that is to win
2155601 and were going to use all three elements to achieve that goal offense defense and special teams
2155602 everyone associated with the football program understands the importance of winning we understand that its time to get this thing turned around we know what it means to west point and to the army to have a successful football team that is a real driving force for us
2155603 not one of the teams we play is going to be easy for us there are no guaranteed wins on the schedule our goal is to go out every week and play to the best of our ability if we go out and compete every single week i think well be pleased with the results
2155604 the attitude of this team is spectacular there was excitement within the program last spring but this year the intensity and the volume of the intensity was turned up a great deal these kids are tired of not winning last years senior class taught our players a lot about hard work although they didnt get to reap the benefits of it the class of 2008s stamp is going to be on this football team as well the leaders on our football team right now are taking things to another level of intensity and expectations
2155605 heading into this season id put a question mark next to the offense as a whole because we havent worked against an opponent yet
2155606 im very optimistic though i liked what i saw from the group this spring but im realistic enough to know that were a long ways from being ready to go that being said we will improve every single day and im looking for big things from our offense
2155607 carson did a real good job adapting to the new offense this spring
2155608 he was our starting quarterback entering spring practice and he will be our starting quarterback heading into preseason camp
2155609 carson understands football he and offensive coordinator coach tim walsh are on the same page with a lot of things we built this new offense knowing that carson could be our starting quarterback hes rock solid and makes good decisions
2155610 you might see carson chip and carlo all play in the same game all three have different strengths and will give opponent defenses different looks we might even use all three in the game at the same time you never know
2155611 we are really excited about paul mcintosh coming in here
2155612 we think he can do some things that are going to allow us to be successful but its hard for a freshman anywhere to grasp the football side of things quickly then you add military training and academics on top and that makes things even more difficult for freshmen at west point thats not to say that it cant be done its just not easy and we dont want to count on him for major contributions this year we know that eventually paul will be a very special quarterback here at west point
2155613 collin mooney is a little bigger version of mike viti
2155614 were very happy to have collin back he had a solid spring and became one of the true leaders on our team
2155615 we have some speed size and toughness at the position we are very high on ehie and mcclary mike viti left a lasting impression on this program everyone saw the type of work ethic mike possessed and that legacy has carried over he set the standard and now his replacements are living up to it
2155616 if we can get everybody healthy we will have a good group of running backs that can go out and be successful
2155617 im really excited about all the things that patrick mealy has done hes going to be a really good one with mcmahand dace and all the others back we should have a full cast from which to choose that is going to be an exciting group of runners
2155618 our new offense fits their abilities well when we were building the system we took into account the type of players we already had in our system and we felt our returning running backs would fit very well we expect all those individuals to play we dont have one guy that we will rely upon to carry the majority of the load well probably attack things by committee once again this year
2155619 but were fortunate to return mike wright and damion hunter
2155620 i feel good about our receivers as a unit wed like to keep them all healthy get them out on the field and see if we cant stretch the field vertically from time to time
2155621 we have two guys with lots of playing time in mike evans and ernie bernal and we feel pretty good about the other guys that will push for playing time when we get down to the goal line we start using three tight ends id like to see that be very competitive
2155622 evans and bernal are strong blockers as good as ive been around they both run very precise pass routes and can catch the ball in traffic we are excited about the players we have at tight end
2155623 its going to be very important for me to see the offensive line come together
2155624 i really believe that they set the tone for practice thats who wins football games and thats who makes everything go the way its supposed to go
2155625 hes got great athletic ability and can do so many things we feel he is only beginning to scratch the surface of his potential
2155626 i thought our entire offensive line performed well this spring
2155627 the players adjusted to their new positions as well as the new system that were running we have the ability to move around the starting five if necessary because of their ability to play multiple positions
2155628 we feel we have the opportunity to have as much or more depth than weve had during the time ive been here all along the offensive line
2155629 we have kids who have developed to the point that they will be competing for starting jobs there is nothing better than competition
2155630 theres been a lot of talk about the offense but the defense is something were really excited about too
2155631 defensive coordinator coach john mumford and his staff have worked very hard in the offseason to make improvements and changes in the defense we have a lot of new people on defense
2155632 weve improved our team speed and weve gotten bigger and stronger up front im happy where were at and im pleased with where were headed we have some young players that could step right in and contribute immediately the biggest thing is that weve increased our team speed and that could make a big difference for us
2155633 they have all kinds of cliches for guys like ted bentler lunchpail mentality blue collar tireless motor and they all fit him well
2155634 hes got great footspeed and changes direction well victor has gained a comfort level at his position and will get out there and really compete we also think that nick emmons is a special talent within our program nick has worked hard in the weight room and is up to about 265 pounds that should help him a great deal
2155635 when you look at players like ted bentler mike gann victor ugenyi
2155636 im pleased with our depth on the defensive line we have a nice mix of veterans and young players that could step right in and help us this is probably the deepest that our defensive line has been since ive been at west point
2155637 linebackers coach robert lyles has done a tremendous job with the linebackers
2155638 we put a great deal of emphasis on our tackling during the offseason i do not believe we were a good tackling team last year led by frank scappaticci and john plumstead the linebackers we have in our program right now will really come up and hit wrap up and take you down scap took well to the move to middle linebacker and improved a great deal this spring plumstead has also emerged as one of our defensive leaders
2155639 josh mcnary is going to be a very special linebacker hes an outstanding athlete and will come up and strike a ball carrier
2155640 we have much more speed at linebacker than we have had in the past
2155641 we have individuals at the position that can play sideline to sideline were not real big but we can fly and those guys are not afraid to stick their head in and hit someone
2155642 jordan trimble is going to be outstanding and he received some playing time last year
2155643 there are some guys who have played but nobody that we had to totally depend on we have some young guys that have ability but its time for them to step up and get rolling this is an area that we will have to focus on during preseason camp
2155644 we lost a lot of talent in our secondary and those players will be hard to replace
2155645 the area remains a concern for us we have some skilled players but they just need to gain experience well continue to monitor things very closely during the preseason
2155646 we worked hard on our special teams this spring because we have so many new players in new roles
2155647 we want to open things up and not be so predictable we may utilize some trick plays if the opportunities present themselves we want the ball in our hands scoring points
2155648 it will be interesting to watch the battle for the starting placekicker job
2155649 we like both adam demarco and matt campbell we just have to watch them during preseason to see which one will provide us with the length we need im anxious to see their leg strength when they report back to camp
2155650 we feel confident that andy rinehart can step in and do a good job punting the football for us this year
2155651 hes a good athlete and has the ability to do some things back there for us we put in some fakes this spring with an intent to find ways to keep the football we dont want to be predictable on special teams i think it is important that we take some chances in certain situations
2155652 hes got some jitter to him and can make things happen damion hunter has great speed and is exciting with the ball in his hands well establish a return specialist during the preseason it could also be one of our incoming freshmen its something that you have to take a lot of pride in you really have to want the job i feel confident that somebody will step up
2155653 we have four projects right now that are what we call construction ready we could install them and get them up and running by spring 2009
2155654 but none of our financial institutions will finance these projects with just the hope that the tax credit will be renewed
2155655 with solar we can put things in place a little more quickly so you are seeing a tremendous jump in solar installations right now
2155656 it is driving up the cost of solar panels and installations
2155657 1 this is example of a reason you need democrats liberals running your country
2155658 our surge has succeeded in iraq militarily now we need an economic surge
2155659 to keep jobs here at home and create new ones
2155660 most americans identify the surge as taking resources and putting them where theyre needed for success
2155661 this is a concept that we feel like we can replicate
2155662 theres a chinese oil rig drilling off the coast of florida right now its based in cuba more are coming soon are we really gonna let the chinese drill up our own oil and sell it back to us at a profit
2155663 it is our understanding that although cuba has leased out exploration blocks 60 miles off the coast of southern florida which is closer than american firms are allowed to operate in that area no chinese firm is drilling there
2155664 the economy sucks except for a few of mccains wealthy friends
2155665 the family is the first and indispensable teacher of peace
2155666 the family is the natural and fundamental group unit of society and is entitled to protection by society and the state
2155667 the rights of the person even if they are expressed as rights of the individual have a fundamental social dimension which finds an innate and vital expression in the family
2155668 imagine you are miles away from here and then come back
2155669 this is a simplified statement the reality is more complex both in practice and effect
2155670 dis tu cours pourquoi cest pour maigrir que tu cours hein parce quil faut que tu maigrisses hein tes grosse
2155671 i think its a lot harder to gain weight and keep it than to lose it i can lose weight easily
2155672 he came back a lot bigger and i think it was a good move to bring him down from linebacker to defensive end hes going to do some great things
2155673 we expected great things from c j coming in to this fall camp and he has exceeded our expectations
2155674 we had a meeting wednesday morning talking about whos done what and c j was the guy who around the room everyone was saying hes really shown up to play
2155675 we had a lot of competition and stuff at linebacker
2155676 they run fast and they hit hard and theyre all smart so i figured id move down and help the team any way i can
2155677 just one gap in front of you kick the guys tail in front of you and get that quarterback
2155678 senator kennedy killed that girl the same as if he put a gun to her head and pulled the trigger
2155679 the klan is needed today as never before and i am anxious to see its rebirth here in west virginia
2155680 with a negro by my side rather i should die a thousand times and see old glory trampled in the dirt never to rise again than to see this beloved land of ours become degraded by race mongrels a throwback to the blackest specimen from the wilds
2155681 how did it come about that highly sensitive technical information was given to the chinese why did the president ignore the national security experts who counseled against this deal what damage has been done to our national security
2155682 lone ranger work has taken him dangerously close to the neighborhood of what we used to call treason
2155683 indeed some of israels best friends and most articulate defenders can be found in the blogosphere little green footballs atlas shrugs hugh hewitt and debbie schlussel all provide a refreshing alternative to the moral relativism and politically correct anti israel blather of the media
2155684 we are perishing for want of wonder not for want of wonders
2155685 if you can become aware of the miraculousness which i symbolise you can help save the freedom mankind is unhappily losing
2155686 nada nos hace creer m s que el miedo la certeza de estar amenazados
2155687 la mayor a de nosotros nos demos cuenta o no nos definimos por oposici n a algo o a alguien m s que a favor de algo o alguien
2155688 nada nos hace creer m s que el miedo la certeza de estar amenazados cuando nos sentimos v ctimas todas nuestras acciones y creencias quedan legitimadas por cuestionables que sean nuestros oponentes o simplemente nuestros vecinos dejan de estar a nuestro nivel y se convierten en enemigos dejamos de ser agresores para convertirnos en defensores la envidia la codicia o el resentimiento que nos mueven quedan santificados porque nos decimos que actuamos en defensa propia el mal la amenaza siempre est en el otro el primer paso para creer apasionadamente es el miedo
2155689 theres nothing intriguing about it its an ad to be directed by imtiaz ali for pepsi earlier deepika and i acted in an ad with shah rukh khan for the same brand now its just the two of us and that should be fun
2155690 i think americans are far more concerned with mexico and mexican citizens than they are with canada and canadian citizens but i would have to say we have a vaguely positive impression of canada
2155691 i was thinking about not playing because my girlfriend was pregnant and i didnt know what to do in that situation
2155692 i didnt know how to handle football and a kid i was still young i talked to some of the coaches and they told me that having a kid would make me work harder and it turns out things worked out
2155693 it helped me a lot it changed my whole life around in terms of working hard and not being so lazy studying harder all that kind of stuff
2155694 im going to try to get out earlier than that but i dont want to get out too early and pull it again and make it worse
2155695 hes doing good so far he said he just needs to work on his plays a little bit i dont know what hes talking about because he did good today
2155696 the defensive end depth is something thats an issue right now in camp
2155697 theres opportunity for a bunch of guys in that mix elliott is in that mix c j allen jones is in the mix cameron allen jones is in that mix and so really to see those three compete its been good so far
2155698 i always try to do better because of him i always try to do better in school because of him he made me a better person
2155699 at the same time its hard because football takes me away from my family i know this is my family here but it takes a lot away from my son i dont want to miss his first step and his first words but at the same time its better for him
2155700 it felt good it was pretty fast faster than twos and threes
2155701 hes focused and theres been a vigor in him so far this camp and it speaks well for his future here
2155702 i do a lot of good things just not consecutively its like spurts so i just have to put it together
2155703 and aaron it finally clicked for him to be consistent and hes the big 12 leader in sacks to this day
2155704 is very soft spoken hes honest hes up front with you humble and very respectful
2155705 and when he gets on the field he lets it go so its good to see
2155706 those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
2155707 to provide zealous legal representation of the highest professional level while at the same time giving each and every client personal individualized attention in a non intimidating manner from a staff that truly cares

2155714 this is something that i caught onto just before 2002 when there was so much research and exploration going around concerning the human colon and digestive system working in harmony with nutritional absorption and i started doing independent studies just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after seeing some fantastic results

2155786 we moderns have gotten used to the slow seemingly inexorable dissolution of traditional social forms the family prominent among them yet the ever decreasing size of the family may soon expose a fundamental contradiction in modernity itself fertility rates have been falling throughout the industrialized world for more than 30 years with implications that are only just now coming into view growing population has driven the economy sustained the welfare state and shaped western culture a declining population could conceivably put the dynamic of modernization into doubt
2155787 historically the aged made up only a small portion of society
2155788 and the rearing of children has been the chief concern now children will become a small minority and societys central problem will be caring for the elderly yet even this assumes that societies consisting of elderly citizens at levels of 20 30 even 40 or more percent can sustain themselves at all that is not obvious

2155801 a house was going to be demolished so bill taylor bought it for a dollar and had it moved onto the land in 1986 the barn likewise was slated to be demolished but the cost of moving it was prohibitive so he tore it down and rebuilt it on his land in 1989 kalyx hosted international work camps whose volunteers helped do the work
2155802 a project to get funding to transfer outmoded technology from the u s to third world countries helping build radio stations in central america his project is called primary communications project and its helped a dozen radio stations get built or improved
2155803 in the country of honduras for example there are a total of five radio engineers to serve 120 stations bill has seen radio stations with exposed wiring and tendencies to burst into flame one nicaraguan station he helped build was blown up a couple of weeks later probably by contras
2155804 while relatively unknown in the u s shortwave radio is the most universally owned communications medium in the world with 660 000 000 receivers worldwide currently u s shortwave is dominated by right wing kooks and propaganda were working to build a high power listener sponsored shortwave station near c u which will be able to bring progressive programming to all areas of the u s and at the same time show the outside world that there are many people here who have a world view which differs with that of our government

2155808 the education system in schools is not meant to serve arabs or their culture in any way
2155809 most first degree students study in colleges and not in universities because they are not admitted into universities the reason is psychometric exam entry exam to universities something sat like but with more difficult conditions
2155810 language a lot of students find studying in hebrew an obstacle in their first year
2155811 and this i can admittedly testify of as i myself experienced it i had a huge difficulty in my first semester with hebrew we study in arabic at school and all of a sudden we are studying in a different language particularly those of us who live in arabic villages or towns
2155812 these issues along with others have an enormous influence on arab students and can lead to one of these
2155813 a student might get totally integrated into the new society and deny their own identity
2155814 we are are using it all the time hearing it all the time
2155815 retirement of the vicinity around them as a result of being scared and unconfident and this makes them shy to ask for your own rights and their primary concern becomes just getting university over with
2155816 the solution would be interacting with the surrounding environment and culture in a positive way which in turn can help maintain our identity this needs a lot of efforts and thus the number of students who are able to integrate while preserving their personality and values is small
2155817 the 3rd problem is the unawareness of students of their role in their society and their ability of changing things such as joining some arab students association because if its not students who will make the change then who will
2155818 the 4th problem is the education crisis arab students rarely read they look at university only as a way to obtain a job and not as developping oneself and acquiring scientific backgrounds
2155819 850 arab students study pharmacology in jordainian universities only to acquire profession and for the lack of a better choice
2155820 arab students must aspire at distinction in a society where they are being discriminated against

2155926 when people in this worn looking city near pittsburgh lament how the sagging economy is slowly crushing them some are also quick to add how much hillary clinton could help them

2156025 dan jika kalian berselisih dalam suatu perkara maka kembalikanlah kepada allah dan rasul nya jika kalian beriman kepada allah dan hari akhir yang demikian itu lebih utama dan lebih baik akibatnya
2156026 kembalikanlah kepada allah dan rasul nya maksudnya kembalikanlah keputusan permasalahan tersebut kepada kitabullah al qur an dan kepada rasul nya dengan bertanya kepada beliau semasa hidupnya atau dengan merujuk kepada sunnah rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam sepeninggal beliau demikianlah keterangan dari mujahid dan qatadah rahimahumullah dan memang benar apa yang mereka katakan itu barangsiapa tidak sepakat dengan apa yang allah subhanahu wa taala bimbingkan pen ini maka telah cacat keimanannya karena allah subhanahu wa taala telah nyatakan dalam ayat tersebut jika kalian beriman kepada allah subhanahu wa taala dan hari akhir
2156027 allah mewajibkan kepada kita agar berpegang teguh dengan kitab nya al qur an dan sunnah nabi nya serta merujuk kepada keduanya di saat terjadi perselisihan
2156028 kesudahan mengedepankan akal adalah belenggu 9 dan kebanyakan upaya hasil pemikiran para intelektual itu adalah kesesatan ruh ruh kami terasa amat liar di dalam tubuh tubuh kami dan hasil dari kehidupan dunia kami adalah gangguan dan siksaan batin tidaklah didapat dari penelitian yang kami lakukan sepanjang masa melainkan kumpulan pernyataan pernyataan yang tak menentu aku ar razi telah memerhatikan dengan saksama berbagai seluk beluk ilmu kalam dan metodologi filsafat maka kulihat semua itu tidaklah dapat menyembuhkan orang yang sakit serta tidak pula memuaskan orang yang dahaga dan ternyata metode yang paling tepat adalah metode al qur an
2156029 engkau akan mendapati kebanyakan para pakar di bidang ilmu kalam filsafat dan bahkan tasawuf yang tidak mengindahkan apa yang dibawa rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam adalah orang orang yang bingung sebagaimana yang dikatakan asy syahrastani rahimahullah sungguh aku telah keliling ke mahad mahad filsafat tersebut dan seluruh pandanganku tertuju kepada mercusuar mercusuarnya namun tak kulihat padanya kecuali orang yang bingung sambil bertopang dagu dan orang yang menyesal sambil menggemertakkan giginya
2156030 pada hari datangnya sebagian tanda tanda rabbmu tidaklah bermanfaat lagi iman seseorang bagi dirinya
2156031 dengan pendapat tersebut akhirnya mereka keluar dari apa yang dinyatakan para ulama hal itu disebabkan penolakan mereka terhadap hadits hadits shahih yang dinukil secara mutawatir dari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
2156032 telah mutawatir hadits hadits seputar dajjal dari jalan sanad yang berbeda beda sebagaimana yang telah saya sebutkan dalam kitab ithaful jamaah jika saja tidak ada hadits hadits tersebut kecuali hadits yang memerintahkan untuk berlindung kepada allah subhanahu wa taala dari fitnah dajjal pada penutupan setiap shalat yang demikian itu sudah cukup sebagai bukti akan adanya dajjal dan bantahan bagi yang mengingkarinya
2156033 pasal iman akan adanya dajjal dan berita pen kemunculannya adalah benar ini merupakan pendapat ahlus sunnah wal jamaah seluruh ahli hadits dan ahli fiqih
2156034 pada hari datangnya sebagian tanda tanda rabb mu tidaklah bermanfaat lagi iman seseorang bagi dirinya
2156035 tiga hal apabila telah muncul terjadi maka tiada bermanfaat lagi sebuah keimanan bagi seorang jiwa yang belum beriman sebelumnya dajjal daabbah dan terbitnya matahari dari arah barat
2156036 tiada seorang pun dari ahli kitab kecuali akan beriman kepadanya isa sebelum kematiannya di akhir zaman pen dan di hari kiamat nanti isa itu akan menjadi saksi terhadap mereka
2156037 dan sesungguhnya isa itu benar benar memberikan pengetahuan tentang hari kiamat karena itu janganlah kamu ragu ragu tentang hari kiamat itu dan ikutilah aku inilah jalan yang lurus
2156038 sesungguhnya penciptaan langit dan bumi lebih besar daripada penciptaan manusia akan tetapi kebanyakan manusia tidak mengetahui
2156039 sesungguhnya allah subhanahu wa taala telah memberikan batasan kemampuan akal yang tak bisa dilampaui dan allah subhanahu wa taala tidak memberikan kemampuan bagi akal untuk mengetahui segala sesuatu yang diinginkan
2156040 berbagai macam berita yang diriwayatkan secara shahih dari nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka benar keberadaannya dan wajib dipercayai baik dapat dirasakan oleh panca indera kita maupun yang bersifat ghaib baik yang dapat dijangkau oleh akal kita maupun tidak
2156041 hakikat iman adalah keyakinan yang sempurna terhadap segala yang diberitakan para rasul yang mencakup ketundukan anggota tubuh kepadanya iman yang dimaksud di sini bukanlah yang berkaitan dengan perkara yang bisa dijangkau panca indera karena dalam perkara yang seperti ini tidak berbeda antara muslim dengan kafir akan tetapi permasalahannya berkaitan dengan perkara ghaib yang tidak bisa kita lihat dan saksikan saat ini kita mengimaninya karena adanya berita yang datang dari allah subhanahu wa taala dan rasul nya inilah keimanan yang membedakan antara muslim dengan kafir yang mengandung kemurnian iman kepada allah subhanahu wa taala dan rasul nya maka seorang mukmin wajib mengimani semua yang diberitakan allah subhanahu wa taala dan rasul nya baik yang dapat disaksikan oleh panca inderanya maupun yang tidak baik yang dapat dijangkau oleh akal dan nalarnya maupun yang tidak dapat dijangkaunya hal ini berbeda dengan kaum zanadiqah yang menampakkan keislaman dan menyembunyikan kekafiran pen serta para pengingkar perkara ghaib yang telah diberitakan allah subhanahu wa taala dan rasul nya dikarenakan akalnya yang bodoh lagi dangkal serta jangkauan ilmunya yang pendek akhirnya mereka dustakan segala apa yang tidak diketahuinya maka rusaklah akal akal pemikiran mereka itu dan bersihlah akal akal pemikiran kaum mukminin yang selalu berpegang dengan petunjuk allah subhanahu wa taala
2156042 pernyataan mereka bahwa apa yang ditampilkan oleh dajjal itu hanyalah sulap dan khayal merupakan pernyataan yang lemah dan tidak bisa diterima karena semua yang diberitakan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam seputar dajjal dan segala kemampuannya merupakan sesuatu yang nyata bisa terjadi dan akal nalar pun bisa menerimanya sehingga wajib difahami sesuai dengan hakikat zhahirnya yang diberitakan rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
2156043 jika semua yang ditampilkan dajjal di hadapan umat manusia itu ada hakikatnya niscaya akan menjadi rancu antara pendusta dan yang jujur dan tidak ada bedanya antara seorang nabi dengan yang mengaku nabi
2156044 asumsi yang demikian merupakan suatu kesalahan dari mereka karena dajjal dengan segala kemampuannya dengan izin allah subhanahu wa taala tidaklah mengaku sebagai nabi akan tetapi justru mengaku sebagai allah subhanahu wa taala yang berhak diibadahi padahal realita keadaannya baik dari segi sepak terjangnya adanya ciri makhluk pada dirinya kondisinya yang cacat fisik tidak mampu mengubah matanya yang buta sebelah menjadi normal dan tidak mampu pula menghilangkan tanda kafir yang ada pada dahinya merupakan bukti kuat bahwa dia pendusta
2156045 apa yang diberitakan rasul kepada kalian maka terimalah dia dan apa yang dilarangnya maka tinggalkanlah dan bertaqwalah kepada allah sesungguhnya allah sangat keras hukuman nya
2156046 dan barangsiapa menentang rasul setelah jelas baginya kebenaran dan mengikuti selain jalannya orang orang mukmin kami biarkan ia leluasa bergelimang dalam kesesatan dan kami masukkan ia ke dalam jahannam dan jahannam itu seburuk buruk tempat kembali
2156047 dan tiadalah yang diucapkannya itu menurut kemauan hawa nafsunya ucapannya itu tiada lain hanyalah wahyu yang diwahyukan kepadanya
2156048 di antara prinsip ahlus sunnah pen beriman akan kemunculan al masih dajjal di akhir zaman pen yang pada dahinya tertulis huruf yang bermakna kafir beriman dengan hadits hadits seputar dajjal dan mengimani keberadaannya serta beriman bahwa nabi isa alaihissalam akan turun ke muka bumi dan membunuh dajjal di bab ludd
2156049 mengimani berita kemunculan al masih dajjal di akhir zaman pen dan turunnya nabi isa bin maryam alaihissalam ke muka bumi lalu membunuh dajjal
2156050 kami beriman akan adanya tanda tanda hari kiamat seperti munculnya dajjal dan turunnya nabi isa alaihissalam dari langit
2156051 bahwa tanda tanda yang akan muncul menjelang hari kiamat seperti munculnya dajjal turunnya nabi isa alaihissalam asap tebal daabbah terbitnya matahari dari arah barat dan lain sebagainya dari tanda tanda yang terdapat dalam hadits hadits shahih adalah benar
2156052 wajib bagi setiap muslim pen untuk beriman kepada semua yang diberitakan nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam dan apa yang dinukil secara shahih dari beliau shallallahu alaihi wa sallam baik perkara tersebut dapat dilihat mata maupun yang bersifat ghaib kami meyakini bahwa semua itu benar dan dapat dipercaya hingga perkataan beliau di antaranya adalah yang berkaitan dengan tanda tanda hari kiamat seperti munculnya dajjal turunnya nabi isa alaihissalam dan akhirnya membunuh dajjal munculnya yajuj dan majuj terbitnya matahari dari arah barat keluarnya daabbah dan lain sebagainya yang telah shahih penukilannya dari rasulullah shallallahu alaihi wa sallam pen

2156110 omdat er geen persoonlijke aanpak was in het kask heb ik niet echt wraakgevoelens ze konden mij gewoon niet helpen je moet zelf veel inzicht hebben om humor te maken en dat hadden zij niet het zijn gewoon heel arrogante bekrompen mensen in mijn tijd op het kask heb ik wel veel beledigingen naar de school toe in mijn filmpjes gestoken zo had ik een aftiteling gemaakt waar kask verscheen met op de achtergrond een toi letpot toen verdween de s het grappige was dat ze over dat filmpje wel positief wa ren
2156111 het jeugdcentrum is gebouwd om een plek voor de jeugd te cre ren vroeger werd gezegd dat het vooral zou zijn om de stroom migranten een plaats te geven maar ik denk dat dat niet waar is iedere jongere uit lokeren is er welkom
2156112 nu zouden er investeringen nodig zijn aan het huidige gebouw omdat er vraag is van de jongeren naar een fuifruimte hebben we gekozen voor een compleet nieuw complex te zetten naast de sporthal
2156113 de zone waarin het jeugdcentrum ligt is in een woonzone met parkachtig karakter de stad mag die zone verkavelen hierop willen ze luxe appartementen installeren het plan komt grotendeels van burgemeester anthuenis vld voor hem is het een louter financi le operatie het doelpubliek voor die appartementen zal afgeschrikt worden door een jeugdcentrum in hun achtertuin daarom moet het jeugdcentrum verhuizen groen vraagt dat het oorspronkelijk idee wordt beschermd in het nieuwe gebouw het jeugdcentrum mag niet opge ist worden door de sporthal wij vrezen dat het nieuwe gebouw niet meer voor de volle honderd procent aandacht zal besteden aan jeugdwerk

2156119 for a long time china has dreamed of opening its doors and inviting the worlds athletes to beijing for the olympic games
2156120 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2156121 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone
2156122 i should never let the dream of all the chinese people down that was why i was nervous
2156123 every time i must balance myself in the air and hold the torch as close to the cauldron gas outlet but every time the wind blew in different directions
2156124 means china is standing side by side with the rest of the world
2156125 the chinese government and the international olympic committee have wasted a historic opportunity to use the beijing games to make real progress on human rights in china
2156126 sorry ken not with you on this one this one tragic accident is no reason to raise a hue and cry for more stringent measures on minors hunting alone
2156127 we dont need state officials in our business any more than they are now which is way too much if you start restricting youth hunting due to a terrible accident then i guess we need to restrict youth from baseball skateboarding and so on
2156128 changing state laws wont stop 14 year olds from going out in the woods to hunt we cannot keep creating laws thinking theyll help people become smarter or better its all about parenting
2156129 i dont believe the state is at fault with its decisions on when people can hunt at what age
2156130 your hunting policy piece was really unfair it wasnt the state policy that was at fault it wasnt the hunter safety course it was the individual who pulled the trigger do you occasionally have to be a knee jerk liberal to stay employed

2156137 deficiency in judgement is properly that which is called stupidity and for such a failing we know no remedy a dull or narrow minded person to whom nothing is wanting but a proper degree of understanding may be improved by tuition even so far as to deserve the epithet of learned but as such persons frequently labour under a deficiency in the faculty of judgement it is not uncommon to find men extremely learned who in the application of their science betray a lamentable degree this irremediable want

2156143 o data pentru totdeauna exista multe lucruri pe care eu 2
2156144 ceea ce creste n singuratate e doar ce aduce fiecare cu sine chiar si bestia din el de aceea eu nu recomand prea multora singuratatea iar daca marea lovitura ati ratat o oare sunteti si voi niste ratati iar daca insiva voi v ati ratat e oare omul pentru aceasta un ratat iar daca omul e ratat ei bine inainte inainte cu cit ceva e mai de pret cu atit e mai greu de obtinut voi oameni superiori ce va aflati aici nu sunteti toti niste ratati fiti voiosi ce are a face mai sint atitea lucruri cu putinta deprindeti va sa rideti de voi insiva asa cum trebuie sa rideti
2156145 eu spun deci orice fiinta care nu poate actiona altfel decit sub ideea de libertate este tocmai de aceea din puct de vedere practic intr adevar libera adica pentru ea sunt valabile toate legile care sunt unite inseparabil cu libertatea
2156146 din pacate si analiza stiintei filosofia stiintei este aenintata sa degenereze intr o moda si sa devina o chestiune de specialitate dar filosofii nu trebuie sa fie specialisti in ce ma priveste ma intereseaza stiinta si filosofia numai fiindca doresc sa invat ceva despre enigma lumii in care traim si despre enigma cunoasterii acelei lumi de catre om si socot ca numai o renastere a interesului nostru pentru aceste enigme poate salva stiinta si filosofia de specializarea ingusta si de credina obscurantista in calificarea speciala a expertului in cunoasterea si autoritatea lui personala o credinta ce se potriveste din pacate asa de bine erei noastre post rationaliste si post critice care se dedica cu mindrie distrugerii traditiei filosofiei rationaliste si a gindirii rationale insasi

2156151 the entry of a giant into a market is always encouraging
2156152 we regard our business partner microsofts move into the email hosting market the way a retailer views the presence of a strong anchor retailer in their mall location
2156153 were excited about microsofts investment in the saas model it is a further indication that this model can deliver more predictable costs enhanced security reliability continuity compliance readiness and full function integration providing a common experience for office mobile and remote employees alike
2156154 by comparison our business model is much more focused we sell services
2156155 because software sales is not our business we eliminate possible confusion and conflict in that area and are able to provide an industry leading enterprise class business email service offering utilizing the best products from many software vendors
2156156 while the availability of exchange hosting from microsoft may increase customer options many organizations from smbs to fortune 100s will continue to value the high level of customization customer service integration between various software vendors solutions smooth migration documented audited and guaranteed performance and ongoing involved locally oriented partnership that they receive with usa net
2156157 so the net result should be a more serious examination of the hosted services or saas model by organizations that might not have considered it which should work for our benefit
2156158 we recognized early on that email is considered critical infrastructure no less important in todays world than dial tone and perhaps even more demanding than voice communications in terms of customization and integration with other business functions
2156159 utilizing the advantages of the hosted services environment we were able to perform strongly enough to lead the hosted email marketplace for 11 years
2156160 and we expect this leadership to continue given our strong performance and the high level of satisfaction from our clients and channel partners it is not surprising to us that microsoft has decided to enter this market
2156161 we are a microsoft business partner and provide extremely reliable hosted sharepoint services 3 0 we also do not have a business that relies on software sales so our message focus investments and strategy are clear and transparent to our clients
2156162 there are many advantages to dealing with usa net including the following
2156163 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2156182 recent reforms are already ensuring that those who can afford to pay for english classes do so and are encouraging employers to take more responsibility for funding training for economic migrants in their workforces
2156183 now we must go further and ensure that the priority is to reach long term residents for whom poor english is a real barrier to integration in work or in the community

2156187 rob has had a lot of success leading enterprise sales teams targeted at the fortune 1000 within the it security and network infrastructure markets

2156205 literally thousands of e mails have been sent by obama supporters from all over to hq and various other individuals associated with the campaign however we have been told that since this is not a normal campaign event that no promises could be made but that we should definitely come and by all means to bring the gifts along

2156209 i cant get into details about other folks that are interested in this technology but as you might imagine of course there is more interest out there
2156210 oh absolutely yeah absolutely and the reason we say that is the type of capabilities they have
2156211 with six degrees of freedom you can basically make any movement at all and be able to track that in combination with the sensor bar and other sensors included in the wii remote add the gyroscope capability and you have the ability to work in all three dimensions of space
2156212 what youre looking at are golf swings tennis rackets where you can put top spin on balls bowling where you can bowl curves sword motions with forward thrusts and in wii sports resort the throttle ability
2156213 i really think weve just begun to scratch the surface gaming is a huge application but if you think of where motions and where motion sensing can be applied then there are so many applications this is a great time to be in the business
2156214 what we hopefully have done is provide our partner with new increased capability and what were so excited to see and await with bated breath is how that will be used
2156215 of course in wii sports resort is one application but whats the future in gaming i dont know we provided some great capability and well see what happens

2156246 i believe the human race can grown spiritually by reviving the ancient primordial tradition that has become buried beneath the materialism of the modern world
2156247 it is clear that the primordial tradition is galactic in nature the galactic center is its orientation locus and is the transcendental source of the wisdom it encodes which now appears ready to make a dramatic appearance on the stage of human history like a lost atlantean dimension of the human soul

2156252 by the time jenkins reached twenty that which was building within him was
2156253 an inner spiritual crisis was welling up inside me and i embarked on a pilgrimage that took me around the southeast united states my mobile hermitage was a 1969 dodge van that i lived in for seven months as my pilgrimage reached a crescendo i meditated chanted and fasted in locations along the gulf coast or in forest service campgrounds in the florida panhandle
2156254 the pilgrimage spontaneously culminated in a three day vigil crying for a vision chanting and praying it was a crisis of connection with a higher guiding force that i yearned to serve in the early predawn hours on the cusp pisces i had a mystical vision of the boon bestowing goddess govinda who i also call the earth guardian
2156255 it wasnt just a dream or vision as it was attended by an actual physical process called a turnabout in the deepest seat of the being
2156256 less than a week after that vision i met the person who encouraged me to travel to mexico and visit the maya
2156257 continues to actively work within me so i can continue to be a mouthpiece for the perennial philosophy but balancing that with the demands of making a living and paying the bills has at times been daunting
2156258 metaphors drawn from the profane modern culture and new terms were being coined for eternal distortion of the ancient wisdom was happening so i decided to place my rational intellect in service to the higher intellect which is to say the heart
2156259 with this approach jenkinss work exemplifies the ability to go beyond the astronomy and venture more deeply into the metaphysics of spiritual transformation that awaits us on our

2156265 the core my ongoing relationship with sophia the higher wisdom it was that vision in 1985 and my work with the tree of life symbology that have led me into these areas of exploration the archetype of the great mother of renewal and wisdom is a recurring motif that emerges in almost all of my books even if i wasnt intending it at the outset overall the core of the work is about healing renewal and opening up a little door at the end of time that leads into a new world a new cycle in the drama of human unfolding

2156279 we are seeing delays but not cancellations in some north american prospects
2156280 beyond that the degree to which the global power group will deliver earnings growth in 2009 will depend on how the north american market develops and on our continued success in booking contracts outside of it

2156769 the big story of the cyclone that ravaged myanmars delta region and the earthquake that devastated chinas sichuan province in may is not only how the chinese government outperformed the burmese military junta in responding to natural disaster it is also how private citizens companies charities and religious organizations from many countries have emerged as a frontline force in helping victims of such tragedies even within government dominated states in the case of china donations from american corporations alone totaled 90 million compared to a modest 3 1 million in u s government aid private giving from british corporations and private citizens to help the more than 368 000 injured and 5 million homeless victims of the earthquake was almost four times larger than britains official aid and beijing estimates that aid from its own private citizens amounted to at least 192 million double that of the american contributions in myanmar the aid levels are lower because the countrys xenophobic rulers blocked most outside help and virtually all foreign aid workers for almost three weeks after the cyclone hit yet even in this shameful situation where private philanthropy was discouraged americans donated 30 1 million through private charities more than the official u s government aid of 24 million as documented by the hudson institute american private philanthropy to poor countries including remittances comes to four and a half times u s government foreign aid even when excluding remittances private philanthropy was 34 8 billion in 2006 compared to official aid at 23 5 billion

2156792 but recovering alcoholics tend to smoke less than drink coffee
2156793 is there something in coffee that may be protective against relapse is there something in cigarettes that may actually reduce the likelihood of relapse
2156794 this finding supports the potential role that nicotine can play in alcohol addiction
2156795 but we dont know how nicotine and alcohol react to keep each other going
2156796 my prediction would be that the relapse rate among smokers is higher
2156797 the drug inhibits the effect of nicotine and by doing that you may also reduce the euphoric effects of alcohol at the same time

2156859 sejak lama berbagai solusi telah dikeluarkan untuk mengatasi gerak laju hiv aids bagi mereka yang berisiko tinggi melalui kontak seksual disarankan untuk menggunakan kondom saat berhubungan seksual solusi ini mengundang kontroversi karena dianggap melegalkan perzinaan bahkan pakar kejiwaan seperti prof dr dadang hawari terkenal gencar menentang solusi tersebut dalam salah satu pernyataannya ia mengatakan bahwa virus hiv lebih kecil dibandingkan pori pori kondom adapun bagi pengguna narkotika suntik kerapkali didengung dengungkan solusi bahwa penggunaan jarum suntik tidak dilakukan secara bersama sama jarum suntik hanya boleh digunakan oleh pribadi yang bersangkutan namun sekali lagi solusi ini juga mengundang kontroversi karena bagaikan mengesahkan penggunaan narkotika di kalangan masyarakat di luar tingkat keberhasilannya sejatinya kedua solusi tersebut hanya berjangka pendek ibarat pohon yang terkena parasit hanya dipotong dahan dan dedaunannya yang tampak kering tidak keseluruhannya tidak juga mencapai akar akarnya sehingga tak heran apabila bagian lain pun bisa segera terkena parasit berbagai solusi telah ditawarkan baik oleh para cendekiawan maupun ahli medis bahwa untuk mengatasi penyebaran dan gerak laju hiv aids seperti yang telah diuraikan tadi mulai dari penggunaan kondom bagi yang berisiko tinggi menghindari penggunaan jarum suntik secara bersama sama bagi pengguna narkoba hingga berbagai alternative lainnya namun hal itu selalu saja mengundang kontroversi dan perbedaan sudut pandang mengapa hal itu bisa terjadi sekali lagi solusi yang ditawarkan tersebut jelas tidak menyentuh akar masalah yang dihadapi tetapi hanya bersifat jangka pendek padahal solusi yang dibutuhkan adalah bagaimana caranya menghindarkan masyarakat dari penyakit hiv aids tersebut dengan pola hidup yang baik benar beradab bukan memberi solusi dengan memunculkan masalah baru misalnya menggunakan kondom mungkin aman tetapi apa jadinya kalau prostitusi malah semakin menjadi jadi atau menggunakan jarum suntik hanya untuk pribadi dan sekali pun memang aman namun bagaimana jika dengan hal itu penggunaan narkoba jenis suntik malah menjadi marak belum lagi kita bisa memperoleh vaksin atau obat yang bisa mengatasi hiv aids masalah sosial baru sudah pasti akan timbul dalam hal ini untuk mengatasi sesuatu harus dicari faktor penyebab utamanya karena itu di sinilah titik tolak solusi itu ditawarkan jika faktor penyebab itu tidak dikaji lebih dulu tindakan apa pun yang dilakukan hanya akan bersifat sementara kita lihat bahwa sebagian besar penyebab hiv aids adalah karena berhubungan seks di luar nikah atau faktor berzina karena itu upaya untuk menanggulanginya yang efektif adalah mencegah perzinaan itu sendiri mustahil dapat diatasi jika zina itu mewabah di tengah tengah masyarakat apabila dilegalkan dengan membuat lokalisasi karena itu sebaiknya kita mencegahnya daripada mengobati artinya menghilangkan sebab lebih baik dari mengobati penyakit yang diakibatkan oleh sebab itu sendiri

2156864 ada hal lain dari petunjuk rosul yang bila dibandingkan dengan ilmu kedokteran tenaga medis pada umumnya seperti perbandingan ilmu kedokteran dengan ilmu pengobatan orang orang awam hal ini sudah diakui oleh kalangan cerdik pandai dan tokoh tokoh ilmu kedokteran yang ada sebagian di antara mereka menyatakan bahwa ilmu kedokteran yang mereka miliki adalah analogi ada juga yang berpendapat bahwa ilmu kedokteran mereka adalah eksperimen ada juga yang berani mengatakan bahwa ilmu kedokteran mereka adalah wangsit dan prediksi yang tepat ada juga yang menyatakan bahwa banyak dari ilmu kedokteran diadopsi dari hewan ternak seperti yang kita lihat bahwa kucing kucing hutan apabila sempat memakan binatang binatang beracun segera mendekati pelita dan menjilati minyaknya untuk mengobati dirinya kita juga bisa melihat ular yang baru keluar dari dalam tanah kalau pandangan matanya kabur segera mendekati daun razyang lalu mengelebatkan matanya di depan daun tersebut seperti juga seekor burung yang suhu tubuhnya terlalu panas segera membenamkan diri ke dalam laut dan banyak lagi contoh lain yang disebutkan dalam dasar dasar ilmu kedokteran bagaimana mungkin semua teori kedokteran semacam itu bisa dibandingkan dengan wahyu yang diturunkan oleh allah kepada rosul nya yang menjelaskan apa yang mendatangkan manfaat dan mendatangkan bahaya perbandingan antara ilmu kedokteran yang mereka miliki dengan wahyu seperti perbandingan antara ilmu ilmu yang mereka miliki dibandingkan dengan ilmu ilmu yang diajarkan oleh para nabi bahkan ajaran para nabi mengandung unsur pengobatan terhadap banyak penyakit yang belum bisa diungkap oleh otak para pakar ilmu kedokteran terhebat sekalipun belum bisa dicapai oleh pengetahuan eksperimen dan analogi mereka yakni pengobatan penyakit hati dan penyakit ruhani memperkuat ketahanan jiwa rasa bersandar dan tawakal kepada allah berpulang kepada hukum nya merendahkan diri di hadapan nya selalu bersedekah berdoa bertaubat istighfar berbuat baik kepada sesama menolong orang susah menghilangkan kesulitan orang lain dan sebagainya semua bentuk pengobatan ini telah dicoba oleh berbagai bangsa dengan segala jenis agama mereka ternyata mereka mendapatkan bentuk bentuk pengobatan semacam itu memiliki pengaruh untuk kesembuhan dalam batas yang tidak pernah dicapai pengetahuan medis di kalangan dokter dengan segala eksperimen dan analogi mereka
2156865 menurut paradigma lama agama dinilai sebagai sesuatu yang harus diterima secara dogmatis terpisah dari sains dan mustahil bisa dibuktikan secara ilmiah implikasinya adalah bahwa dakwah sering dilakukan hanya dengan pendekatan yang bersifat normative ancaman dan siksaan bukan atas dasar bahwa ibadah itu suatu kebutuhan dan memiliki implikasi langsung bagi kesehatan dan kesempurnaan lahir batin

2156897 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2156898 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free

2157027 kembalilah pulang kalian akan diberi air hujan melalui doa dari makhluk selain kalian
2157028 sungguh menakjubkan perkaranya orang mukmin sesungguhnya semua perkaranya adalah baik dan tidaklah hal ini dimiliki oleh seorangpun kecuali oleh orang mukmin jika dia diberi kenikmatan kesenangan dia bersyukur maka jadilah ini sebagai kebaikan baginya sebaliknya jika dia ditimpa musibah sesuatu yang tidak menyenangkan dia bersabar maka ini juga menjadi kebaikan baginya
2157029 hai manusia sesungguhnya kami menciptakan kalian dari seorang laki laki dan seorang perempuan dan menjadikan kalian berbangsa bangsa dan bersuku suku supaya kalian saling kenal mengenal sesungguhnya orang yang paling mulia di antara kalian di sisi allah ialah orang yang paling bertakwa di antara kalian sesungguhnya allah maha mengetahui lagi maha mengenal
2157030 sesungguhnya salah seorang dari kalian dikumpulkan penciptaannya dalam perut ibunya selama 40 hari dalam bentuk nuthfah air mani kemudian berbentuk segumpal darah dalam waktu yang sama lalu menjadi segumpal daging dalam waktu yang sama pula kemudian diutus seorang malaikat kepadanya lalu ditiupkan ruh padanya dan diperintahkan dengan empat kalimat perkara ditentukan rizkinya ajalnya amalannya sengsara atau bahagianya
2157031 tiada suatu bencanapun yang menimpa di bumi dan tidak pula pada diri kalian sendiri melainkan telah tertulis dalam kitab lauh mahfuzh sebelum kami menciptakannya sesungguhnya yang demikian itu adalah mudah bagi allah kami jelaskan yang demikian itu supaya kalian jangan berduka cita terhadap apa yang luput dari kalian dan supaya kalian jangan terlalu gembira terhadap apa yang diberikan nya kepada kalian dan allah tidak menyukai setiap orang yang sombong lagi membanggakan diri yaitu orang orang yang kikir dan menyuruh manusia berbuat kikir dan barangsiapa yang berpaling dari perintah perintah allah maka sesungguhnya allah dia lah yang maha kaya lagi maha terpuji
2157032 tiada suatu amalan pun yang mendekatkan ke surga kecuali aku telah perintahkan kalian dengannya dan tiada suatu amalan pun yang mendekatkan ke neraka kecuali aku telah larang kalian darinya sungguh salah seorang di antara kalian tidak akan lambat rizkinya sesungguhnya jibril telah menyampaikan pada hatiku bahwa salah seorang dari kalian tidak akan keluar dari dunia meninggal dunia sampai disempurnakan rizkinya maka bertakwalah kepada allah wahai manusia dan perbaguslah dalam mencari rizki maka apabila salah seorang di antara kalian merasa menganggap bahwa rizkinya lambat maka janganlah mencarinya dengan bermaksiat kepada allah karena sesungguhnya keutamaan karunia allah tidak akan didapat dengan maksiat
2157033 dan tolong menolonglah kalian dalam mengerjakan kebajikan dan takwa dan jangan tolong menolong dalam berbuat dosa dan pelanggaran dan bertakwalah kalian kepada allah sesungguhnya allah amat berat siksa nya
2157034 barangsiapa menghilangkan satu kesusahan dari kesusahan kesusahan dunia dari seorang mukmin maka allah akan hilangkan darinya satu kesusahan dari kesusahan kesusahan hari kiamat dan barangsiapa yang memudahkan orang yang mengalami kesulitan maka allah akan mudahkan baginya di dunia dan di akhirat dan barangsiapa yang menutupi aib seorang muslim maka allah akan tutupi aibnya di dunia dan akhirat dan allah akan senantiasa menolong hamba selama hamba tersebut mau menolong saudaranya
2157035 tidaklah seseorang ditimpa suatu kegundahan maupun kesedihan lalu dia berdoa
2157036 ya rasulullah tidakkah kami ajarkan doa ini kepada orang lain
2157037 bahkan selayaknya bagi siapa saja yang mendengarnya agar mengajarkannya kepada yang lain
2157038 ya allah sesungguhnya aku berlindung kepada mu dari gundah gulana sedih lemah malas kikir penakut terlilit hutang dan dari tekanan penindasan orang lain
2157039 ilmu adalah pengganti dari segala kelezatan dan mencukupi dari segala kesenangan barangsiapa yang menyendiri dengan ilmu maka kesendiriannya itu tidak menjadikan dia sepi dan barangsiapa yang menghibur diri dengan kitab kitab maka dia akan mendapat kesenangan maka tidak ada teman ngobrol sebaik ilmu dan tidak ada sifat yang akan menolong pemiliknya seperti sifat al hilm sabar dan tidak terburu buru
2157040 dan ya qub berpaling dari mereka anak anaknya seraya berkata
2157041 demi allah senantiasa kamu mengingati yusuf sehingga kamu mengidapkan penyakit yang berat atau termasuk orang orang yang binasa
2157042 sesungguhnya hanyalah kepada allah aku mengadukan kesusahan dan kesedihanku dan aku mengetahui dari allah apa yang kalian tiada mengetahuinya
2157043 maka maryam mengandungnya lalu ia menyisihkan diri dengan kandungannya itu ke tempat yang jauh
2157044 aduhai alangkah baiknya aku mati sebelum ini dan aku menjadi sesuatu yang tidak berarti lagi dilupakan
2157045 janganlah kamu bersedih hati sesungguhnya tuhanmu telah menjadikan anak sungai di bawahmu dan goyanglah pangkal pohon kurma itu ke arahmu niscaya pohon itu akan menggugurkan buah kurma yang masak kepadamu

2157374 within a year to have only things that we use daily in our apartment
2157375 often these are things that represent who you once were
2157376 but once their purpose is over they just keep you stagnant

2157386 the fact that an israeli citizen can be awarded a palestinian passport can be a sign that it is actually possible
2157387 it would be absolutely horrible if now with good intentions expectations are raised which will not be able to be fulfilled
2157388 now even not very intelligent people are saying that the occupation has to be stopped

2157482 what gain has the worker from his toil i have seen the business that god has given to the children of man to be busy with he has made everything beautiful in its time also he has put eternity into mans heart yet so that he cannot find out what god has done from the beginning to the end i perceived that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do good as long as they live also that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil this is gods gift to man
2157483 god has made man according to how eternity is thusly nothing in this world will satisfy and it waits and it longs for the one thing that is meant to satisfy such a thirst for eternity he waits for the word to come into human history to heal its long endured birth pain and harsh effects of sin and suffering

2157570 aahh aku nggak mau ciuman dengan si gendut mesum ini tapi aah kenapa aku tak bisa menghentikan lumatan bibir tebalnya aku tak bisa mencegah lidahnya bermain di mulutku agghh kenapa aku ini
2157571 pikr erlina detektif wanita yang cantik itu hanya bisa mendesah di buai kenikmatan yang membuat payudaranya bertambah keras putingnya makin mencuat dan selangkangannya terasa lembab

2157573 saya suka yang jembutnya lebat gini kayak punya artis artis bokep jepang hehehe
2157574 ahh ini tidak wajar gairah ini seakan tak mau berhenti malah bertambah besar walaupun tubuhku sudah tak mampu lagi ini ini pasti efek the click ya itu dia makanya gadis secantik erlina sampai mau bercinta denganku apa the click yang ada di sakuku tertekan secara tak sengaja
2157575 dimana alat itu tadi aku menyimpannya di saku bajuku ini tapi sekarang tak ada tapi dimanapun itu pasti letaknya masih di sekitar sini karena aku masih bisa merasakan efeknya apa mungkin terjatuh tapi kapan eh jangan jangan
2157576 lin tunggu sebentar lin apa kamu melihat sebuah kotak hitam

2157579 kotak apa ngapain mikiran kotak yang nggak berguna lebih baik kita bercinta lagi sayang
2157580 tadi aku menemukannya di jalan lalu menyimpannya di saku bajuku
2157581 bagaimana ini bisa terjadi lagi padaku aku kembali bertingkah seperti wanita murahan yang mau bercinta dengan siapa saja apa yang sebenarnya terjadi
2157582 kayaknya the click perlu sedikit penyempurnaan lagi efeknya ternyata begitu mengerikan bila digunakan secara sembarangan mmm sepertinya aku harus memasang semacam limiter agar meningkatnya gairah seksual itu bisa agak terkontrol limiter itu masalah mudah yang sulit adalah menetukan ukuran dan batasnya apa yang bisa kugunakan sebagai indikator untuk gairah seks gejala fisik gelombang otak ya ya mungkin itu terus sensornya mmm mungkin bisa dengan ya ya bisa juga mmm kalaupun semua teori itu bisa dijalankan aku juga harus memikirkan cara untuk membuatnya dalam ukuran super mini agar dapat di tampung dalam desain the click yang sekarang bentuk yang sekarang itu sudah pas ukurannya portable dan mudah disimpan ya ya kalo begitu aku harus
2157583 eh i ini ada apa lin ke kenapa ka kamu menodongkan pistol padaku sa salah apa aku
2157584 cepat kamu jelaskan apa yang sebenarnya terjadi kenapa semua ini bisa terjadi cepat jawab
2157585 jangan pura pura kenapa aku bisa melakukan hal yang memalukan itu sama kamu dan tadi siang juga bajingan bajingan itu aku tahu ada sesuatu yang tak wajar yang menyebabkan semua itu dan aku merasa itu ada hubungannya dengan kotak hitam yang sekarang kamu pegang itu apa kamu bekerja sama dengan bajingan bajingan itu ugghh demi tuhan aku akan menembak kepalamu bila kamu tak menjelaskan semuanya
2157586 aku tak mengenal mereka sumpah mmm kalo masalah bagaimana semua ini bisa terjadi mungkin aku bisa jelaskan ta tapi tolong turunkan dulu pistol kamu
2157587 awas jangan pikir kamu bisa kabur sebelum menjelaskan semuanya aku bisa menembak sasaran apapun tanpa meleset satu milipun dalam jarak 30 meter
2157588 hhhmmm semuanya ini terjadi karena alat ciptaanku setidaknya aku berhutang penjelasan pada erlina aku harus siap menerima semua resikonya
2157589 the click adalah sebuah alat yang bisa membuat gairah birahi semua orang yang ada di sekitarnya menjadi meningkat hingga semua orang yang berada di sekitar alat ini saat aktif maka orang itu akan merasakan gairah untuk bercinta dan memuaskan nafsunya tak peduli bagaiman caranya atau dengan siapa yang penting orang itu bisa memuaskan gairah seksualnya
2157590 bull shit itu omong kosong mana ada alat seperti itu

2157685 as so often in america competition has produced success and a certain amount of excess
2157686 as of 2007 there were an estimated 25 million under insured adults in the united states up 60 percent from 2003
2157687 i had been in newspapers for 14 years and going to a magazine its a whole different style of writing
2157688 the editors said i adjusted pretty quickly im still not to that degree of comfort yet
2157689 the editors like a lot of scenes when youre describing whats happening
2157690 no wonder we make the top five most profitable casino in the country every year
2157691 i really loved being able to take the lesson from my office and never have to leave to go to a classroom yes i felt like i learned faster because i had someone there one on one answering my questions
2157692 its nice to be able to ask questions and to be able to go at my own pace it feels as though you are right in the middle of a classroom but within the comfort of your own home
2157693 i really like having the internet there to interact with as well as you on the phone
2157694 i love that i can sit at home to take the class i learned a lot more than i expected in such a short time
2157695 i like being able to take the class at home online and its very helpful to hear a spanish speaking person pronounce the words
2157696 i was able to learn quickly i think learning spanish will be better with a tutor than listening to an audio cd
2157697 i like the convenience of attending a spanish class with a teacher whose native language is spanish from my home or any other location from which i can establish a phone amp an internet connection
2157698 i did really like the class the teachers were very encouraging and it was great to be able to hear the language and not just read it in a book
2157699 the instructors were very flexible in helping me as a visually impaired student i am extremely satisfied and thankful for the accommodations that they made to give me a great experience
2157700 being able to clearly understand the pronunciation really helped plus the instantaneous screen action made the lesson more interesting and less stressful yes the classes meet my expectations and more we will refer you to as many people as possible
2157701 i have taken home study programs before and this instruction is far superior to that which i received in the past your lessons are of much higher quality and this is probably because your instructors are of higher quality
2157702 the teacher was so enthusiastic interesting engaging and easy to understand
2157703 i liked the fact that the classes are small cause the teacher then can assess each students needs and adjust accordingly
2157704 in the past several months my communication skills have improved at least 50 i have enjoyed using your fabulous
2157705 i enjoyed the interaction of the teacher and other students
2157706 i like the informal structure that we can ask questions at any time we can review past material each lesson builds on the previous lessons we learn from each others mistakes and we can help each other
2157707 i was able to work on my pronunciation and learn more through interaction with the teacher and others in the class the pronunciation is the hardest part so it was more effective to hear the instructor speak the words first
2157708 i love the fact that she repeats and builds on lessons previously learned

2157723 semelhante a um espelho em que a igreja peregrinante na terra contempla a deus

2157725 juntas a tradi o e a escritura constituem um s sagrado dep sito da palavra de deus confiado igreja
2157726 a sagrada tradi o a transmiss o da palavra de deus esta transmiss o feita oficialmente pelos sucessores dos ap stolos e n o oficialmente por todos os que cultuam ensinam e vivem a f tal como a igreja a entende
2157727 esta tradi o oriunda dos ap stolos progride na igreja sob a assist ncia do esp rito santo cresce com efeito a compreens o tanto das coisas como das palavras transmitidas no decorrer dos s culos a igreja tende continuamente para a plenitude da verdade divina at que se cumpram nela as palavras de deus

2157729 redes com que desde a antiguidade se pescam homens de bem
2157730 redes com que agora se pescam os bens dos homens
2157731 o conc lio vaticano ii coroou a constitui o dogm tica sobre a igreja com um belo cap tulo sobre maria como prot tipo e modelo da igreja a igreja n o pode chegar a entender plenamente a uni o com cristo e o servi o a seu evangelho sem um amor e um conhecimento profundos de maria m e de nosso senhor e nossa m e
2157732 na anuncia o do anjo a virgem maria recebeu o verbo de deus no cora o e no corpo e trouxe ao mundo a vida por isso reconhecida e honrada como verdadeira m e de deus e do redentor
2157733 e a igreja cat lica instru da pelo esp rito santo honra a com afeto de piedade filial como m e amant ssima
2157734 ela concebeu gerou nutriu a cristo apresentou o ao pai no templo compadeceu com seu filho que morria na cruz por tal motivo ela se tornou para n s m e na ordem da gra a
2157735 por sua maternal caridade cuida dos irm os de seu filho que ainda peregrinam na terra rodeados de perigos e dificuldades at que sejam conduzidos feliz p tria
2157736 a igreja venera tamb m os outros santos que j est o com o senhor no c u s o pessoas que serviram a deus e ao pr ximo dum modo t o not vel que foram canonizados isto a igreja declarou oficialmente her icos e nos exorta a rezarmos a eles pedindo sua intercess o por todos n s junto a deus
2157737 a comunh o dos santos uma rua de m o dupla o vaticano ii afirma que assim como voc na terra pode ajudar aqueles que sofrem o purgat rio assim os que est o no c u podem ajud lo na sua peregrina o intercedendo por voc junto de deus
2157738 alguns consideram nossa senhora quase como uma quarta pessoa complementar trindade crist pai filho e esp rito santo
2157739 maria co redentora m s de maio um dos mais lindos do ano a humanidade dedicou a nossa senhora quase em todas as igrejas e capelas diariamente neste m s o povo se re ne para cantar ladainhas e louvores a nossa senhora nossa senhora invocada venerada e cultuada pelas raz es muito profundas e b blicas maria a m e de jesus que deus filho de deus nosso salvador e portanto ela a co redentora da humanidade
2157740 assim de modo inteiramente singular pela obedi ncia f esperan a e caridade ela cooperou na obra do salvador para a restaura o da vida sobrenatural das almas por tal motivo ela se tornou para n s m e na ordem da gra a
2157741 h um s deus e um s mediador entre deus e os homens cristo jesus homem
2157742 por isso tamb m pode salvar totalmente os que por ele se chegam a deus vivendo sempre para interceder por eles
2157743 n o h salva o em nenhum outro porque abaixo do c u n o existe nenhum outro nome dado entre os homens pelo qual importa que sejamos salvos
2157744 na casa de meu pai h muitas moradas vou preparar vos lugar
2157745 a minha alma engrandece ao senhor e o meu esp rito se alegrou em deus meu salvador porque contemplou na humildade da sua serva pois desde agora todas as gera es me considerar o bem aventurada porque o poderoso me fez grandes coisas santo o seu nome
2157746 senhores por que fazeis isto n s tamb m somos homens como v s sujeitos aos mesmos sentimentos e vos anunciamos o evangelho para que destas coisas v s vos convertais ao deus vivo que fez o c u a terra o mar e tudo o que h neles
2157747 at que eu seja reconhecida no lugar em que a sant ssima trindade desejou que eu estivesse eu n o poderei exercer meu poder totalmente no trabalho materno de co reden o e de media o universal das gra as
2157748 tendo pois a jesus o filho de deus como grande sumo sacerdote que penetrou os c us conservemos firmes a nossa confiss o porque n o temos sumo sacerdote que n o possa compadecer se das nossas fraquezas antes foi ele tentado em todas as coisas nossa semelhan a mas sem pecado acheguemo nos portanto confiadamente junto ao trono da gra a a fim de recebermos miseric rdia e acharmos gra a para socorro em ocasi o oportuna
2157749 ele vos deu vida estando v s mortos nos vossos delitos e pecados e estando n s mortos em nossos delitos nos deu vida juntamente com cristo pela gra a sois salvos

2157752 a nica e verdadeira igreja a comunidade de homens reunidos pela profiss o da mesma f crist e pela comunh o dos mesmos sacramentos sob o governo dos leg timos pastores e especialmente do vig rio de cristo na terra o romano pont fice
2157753 agora a santa igreja universal proclama que apenas dentro dela deus pode ser realmente adorado e que fora dela ningu m pode ser salvo
2157754 realmente existe apenas uma igreja universal dos fi is fora da qual ningu m salvo cremos com nossos cora es e confessamos com nossos l bios que existe apenas uma igreja n o a dos hereges mas a santa igreja cat lica e apost lica romana fora da qual acreditamos que ningu m pode ser salvo
2157755 n s declaramos dizemos definimos e proclamamos que absolutamente necess rio para a salva o de toda a criatura humana estar sujeita ao pont fice romano
2157756 a santa igreja romana acredita professa e prega que todo aquele que permanece fora da igreja cat lica n o apenas os pag os mas tamb m judeus her ticos e cism ticos n o tomar o parte da vida eterna mas ir o para o fogo perp tuo que foi preparado para o diabo e seus anjos a n o ser que antes da morte eles se unam igreja de tal modo importante a uni o com o corpo da igreja que seus sacramentos s o teis para a salva o apenas para aqueles que permanecem dentro dela e jejuns esmolas e outros trabalhos piedosos assim como a pr tica da guerra crist s proporcionar o recompensas eternas a eles t o somente
2157757 onde a necessidade de salva o se referir a todos os fi is de cristo dever estar sujeita ao pont fice romano como nos foi ensinado pelas sagradas escrituras pelo testemunho dos santos padres e pela constitui o do nosso predecessor de feliz mem ria bonif cio viii
2157758 a igreja cat lica o verdadeiro caminho para a salva o
2157759 pois n s tamb m outrora ramos n scios desobedientes desgarrados escravos de toda sorte de paix es e prazeres vivendo em mal cia e inveja odiosos e odiando nos uns aos outros quando por m se manifestou a benignidade de deus nosso salvador e o seu amor para com todos n o por obras de justi a praticadas por n s mas segundo sua miseric rdia ele nos salvou mediante o lavar regenerador e renovador do esp rito santo que ele derramou sobre n s ricamente por meio de jesus cristo nosso salvador
2157760 e se pela gra a j n o pelas obras do contr rio a gra a j n o gra a
2157761 sendo justificados gratuitamente por sua gra a mediante a reden o que h em cristo jesus a quem deus prop s no seu sangue como propicia o mediante a f para manifestar a sua justi a por ter deus na sua toler ncia deixado impunes os pecados anteriormente cometidos tendo em vista a manifesta o da sua justi a no tempo presente para ele mesmo ser justo e o justificador daquele que tem f em jesus
2157762 visto que a justi a de deus se revela no evangelho de f em f como est escrito o justo viver por f
2157763 visto que ningu m ser justificado diante dele por obras da lei em raz o de que pela lei vem o pleno conhecimento do pecado
2157764 conclu mos pois que o homem justificado pela f independentemente das obras da lei
2157765 e evidente que pela lei ningu m justificado diante de deus porque o justo viver pela f
2157766 mas v s sois dele em cristo jesus o qual se nos tornou da parte de deus sabedoria e justi a e santifica o e reden o
2157767 aquele que n o conheceu pecado ele o fez pecado por n s para que nele f ssemos feitos justi a de deus

2157876 buku itu menodai akidah ummat masa umur nabi muhammad sampai 77 tahun isterinya sampai 41 belum lagi berbagai hal yang banyak menyimpang kesalahan seperti itu bisa merembet ke persoalan akidah yang lain
2157877 itu isu yang dihembuskan oknum aparat yang telah saya pecat mereka sakit hati masa gara gara umur disesatkan apalagi saya melakukan pelecehan seksual jika orang sudah benci apapun akan terlihat jelek tak ada yang bertentangan dengan syara
2157878 yang jelas dalam mengeluarkan fatwa kami tidak sembarangan sangat hati hati dan berdasarkan kajian mendalam jadi bukan hanya karena soal umur nabi muhammad fatwa itu tidak akan kami cabut
2157879 walaupun fatwa itu tidak mengikat seperti hukum positif biarlah masyarakat yang menilai
2157880 saya kira mui telah dijebak mereka tidak akan mengeluarkan fatwa demikian
2157881 siapa pun tidak berhak mengatakan sesat atau tidak termasuk mui hanya allah yang bisa
2157882 tetapi kekeliruan yang dilakukan abah mk lebih membahayakan akidah ummat islam
2157883 saya bertindak berdasarkan laporan mantan dewan guru dan murid mk sendiri
2157884 semua yang diungkapkan itu tidak memiliki referensi bahkan antara kitab al risalah al mukarramah dan risalah kitab mahesa kurung satu sama lain bertentangan tidak konsisten jika dibiarkan akan menjurus kepada penodaan akidah dan membelokkan fajta sejarah
2157885 tapi jika pun mui pusat menerbitkan fatwa mk tidak sesat itu tidak akan berpengaruh terhadap fatwa yang sudah ada karena dalam tata tertib fatwa dimungkinkan ada pertentangan

2157948 dan sekali kali allah tidak mengazab mereka sedangkan kamu berada di antara mereka dan tidaklah pula allah akan mengazab mereka sedang mereka memohon ampunan
2157949 dan katakanlah bebaskanlah kami dari dosa niscaya kami akan mengampuni kesalahan kesalahan kalian dan kelak kami akan menambah pemberian kami kepada orang orang yang bertobat
2157950 dan orang orang yang apabila mengerjakan perbuatan keji atau menganiaya diri mereka sendiri maka mereka lantas ingat akan allah lalu memohon ampun terhadap dosa dosa mereka

2158396 saya sarankan sebaiknya tinggalkan pakaian sepinggul pakailah yang longgar longgar atau baju terusan saja
2158397 sebetulnya ini gejala yang biasa kita rasakan sehari hari misalnya saat duduk atau menekuk kaki terlalu lama saraf dan aliran darah pasti terganggu mirip kabel listrik yang tertekan aliran setrumnya kan enggak lancar
2158398 gampangnya lihat saja pasien yang harus lama berbaring di tempat tidur kalau perawatnya kurang telaten bagian belakang tubuh si pasien biasanya agak memerah dan lecet
2158399 tapi fungsi bedak kan cuma mengeringkan jika ternyata bedak tadi tak cukup bagus untuk menyerap keringat kulit menjadi lebih lembap akhirnya malah dihampiri jamur
2158400 saat itu saya menghadiri sebuah acara dengan celana ketat dari kulit walau hanya dipakai beberapa jam paha saya sempat terasa panas ini mirip gejala yang dibilang para dokter barangkali karena gesekan dan kelembapan yang tinggi
2158401 tapi kalau memang hip style berpotensi mengganggu kesehatan sebaiknya celana sepinggul memang tidak dipakai sembarangan tampil modis kan enggak harus mengorbankan kesehatan
2158402 lagi pula tidak semua aktivitas layak dihadiri dengan memakai celana sebatas pinggul

2158456 het begon eigenlijk als n grote grap vijfentwintig jaar geleden bedacht ik samen met mijn vijf beste vrienden en tevens medeoprichters van apollokiddz enterprises dat het misschien leuk zou zijn om een eigen weblog te beginnen we kochten een digitale fotocamera en we deden om de twee dagen online verslag van onze avonturen om extra bezoekers te trekken bedachten we keer op keer nieuwe ludieke acties zo hebben we een keer het helaas vergane pakhuis afrika in amsterdam beschilderd hebben we s nachts stiekem een paar rondjes gescheurd over het asfalt van het circuit van zandvoort en zijn we een keer in een nacht naar parijs gereden om daar uit te gaan en de volgende ochtend doodleuk weer naar huis gereden heerhugowaard is van nature een erg saaie gemeente we waren tieners en op zoek naar een uitdaging vooral creatief gezien ik studeerde zelf interactieve media in amsterdam dat is toch de stad waar alles gebeurt we wilden heerhugowaard wakker schudden en dat lukte met onze weblog het werd een succes naast onze verslagen met fotos begonnen we ook met het maken van korte filmpjes en het posten van nieuwe muziek het bezoekersaantal bleef stijgen en wij bleven steeds nieuwe dingen verzinnen
2158457 het klinkt misschien clich maar we doen alleen dingen die we zelf leuk en interessant vinden we nemen alleen opdrachten aan die ons creatief motiveren en interesseren daarom hebben we ook aan de meest uiteenlopende projecten gewerkt zowel voor de grote bedrijven als voor de kleine jongens daarnaast is continu teit het sleutelwoord het is niet moeilijk om the coolest boy from the block te worden maar om het te blijven is een ander verhaal we zijn nu al 25 jaar bezig en we worden eigenlijk steeds beter in wat we doen
2158458 we blijven projecten doen die ons creatief gezien uitdagen ik reis veel luister veel muziek en ik kijk goed wat er om me heen gebeurt om vooruitstrevend te blijven moet je in mijn optiek met je hart beslissen niet bang zijn om risicos te nemen en niet te veel in euros te denken ondanks we veel invloeden van buitenaf gebruiken streef ik toch meer naar een eigen gezicht ik wil dat als iemand onze projecten ziet direct ziet dat het uit de apollokiddz stal komt de apollokiddz stijl moet een kwaliteitsgarantie worden

2158692 mengenai agamaku islam stella aku harus menceritakan apa agama islam melarang umatnya mendiskusikannya dengan umat agama lain lagi pula sebenarnya agamaku karena nenek moyangku islam bagaimana aku dapat mencintai agamaku kalau aku tidak mengerti tidak boleh memahaminya al quran terlalu suci tidak boleh diterjemahkan kedalam bahasa apa pun di sini tidak ada orang yang mengerti bahasa arab di sini orang diajar membaca al quran tetapi tidak mengerti apa yang dibacanya kupikir pekerjaan orang gilakah orang diajar membaca tapi tidak diajar makna yang dibacanya itu sama saja halnya seperti engkau mengajarkan aku buku bahasa inggris aku harus hafal kata demi kata tetapi tidak satu patah kata pun yang kau jelaskan kepadaku apa artinya tidak jadi orang sholeh pun tidak apa apa asalkan jadi orang yang baik hati bukankah begitu stella

2158697 bagaimana pendapatmu tentang zending jika bermaksud berbuat baik kepada rakyat jawa semata mata atas dasar cinta kasih bukan dalam rangka kristenisasi bagi orang islam melepaskan keyakinan sendiri untuk memeluk agama lain merupakan dosa yang sebesar besarnya pendek kata boleh melakukan zending tetapi jangan mengkristenkan orang mungkinkah itu dilakukan
2158698 moga moga kami mendapat rahmat dapat bekerja membuat umat agama lain memandang agama islam patut disukai

2158724 primitif semakin lama semakin primitif primitif itu umpatan kakek bila menilai keadaan pembangunan jalan jalan hanya untuk yang bermobil pejalan kaki pun tak berhak menggunakannya di tanahair sendiri tanpa kaki lima primitif itu umpatannya immoral immoral dia tak butuhkan tanggapan orang lain usia telah merampas pendengarannya primitif immoral dan setiap matanya menangkap jambang jambang beton di kakilima apa dengusnya jambang di kakilima tambahan isi kantong mereka dari kantong semua demi untuk menghadang kita sepertinya dia sedang berpantun kalau cuma begitu saja dengusnya sepanjang jalan puih gampang amat jadi immoral semakin lama semakin primitif

2158970 dont speak too quickly say only that the horse is not in the stable that is all we know the rest is judgment if ive been cursed or not how can you know how can you judge
2158971 dont make us out to be fools we may not be philosophers but great philosophy is not needed the simple fact that your horse is gone is a curse
2158972 all i know is that the stable is empty and the horse is gone the rest i dont know whether it be a curse or a blessing i cant say all we can see is a fragment who can say what will come next

2159048 what killed most of the startups in the e commerce business back in the 90s it was bad programmers a lot of those companies were started by business guys who thought the way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired programmers to implement it thats actually much harder than it sounds almost impossibly hard in fact because business guys cant tell which are the good programmers they dont even get a shot at the best ones because no one really good wants a job implementing the vision of a business guy in practice what happens is that the business guys choose people they think are good programmers it says here on his resume that hes a microsoft certified developer but who arent then theyre mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a world war ii bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters this kind of startup is in the same position as a big company but without the advantages so how do you pick good programmers if youre not a programmer i dont think theres an answer i was about to say youd have to find a good programmer to help you hire people but if you cant recognize good programmers how would you even do that

2159368 once upon a time in a large forest there lived a very furry bunny
2159369 when christmas eve finally came barrington did not feel like going home all by himself
2159370 can hop and they are very warm too because of how furry they are
2159371 on his way however he passed a large oak tree
2159372 well how can you come to the party if youre a bunny bunnies cant climb trees
2159373 but i can hop and im very furry and warm
2159374 we dont know anything about hopping and being furry but we do know that in order to come to our house you have to be able to climb trees
2159375 it was beginning to snow when barrington reached the river
2159376 but i can hop and i am very furry and warm
2159377 i dont know anything about hopping and being furry but i do know that in order to come to our house you have to be able to swim
2159378 even as furry as he was barrington was starting to get cold
2159379 hello field mice this is barrington bunny may i come to your party
2159380 bunnies he thought arent any good to anyone what good is it to be furry and to be able to hop if you dont have any family on christmas eve
2159381 then barrington dug and dug soon he had gathered together enough dead leaves and grass to make the squirrels nest warmer hop hop hippity hop he laid the grass and leaves just under the large oak tree and attached this message a gift a free gift from a member of your family
2159382 barrington had only two thoughts that long cold night first he thought its good to be a bunny bunnies are very furry and warm and then when he felt the heart of the tiny mouse beating regularly he thought all the animals in the forest are my family
2159383 next morning the field mice found their little boy asleep in the snow warm and snug beneath the furry carcass of a dead bunny
2159384 after the field mice had left barringtons frozen body simply lay in the snow there was no sound except that of the howling wind and no one anywhere in the forest noticed the great silver wolf who came to stand beside that brown lop eared carcass but the wolf did come and he stood there without moving or saying a word all christmas day until it was night and then he disappeared into the forest

2159451 the upcoming vote on a 100 per cent increase to toronto land transfer taxes is the new provincial governments first test on municipal finance issues the question to them is simple will the provincial government take strong action and signal a new fair course for municipal finances
2159452 the public feels strongly that a second land transfer tax is not the answer to the citys financial difficulties in just the last few weeks we have seen literally thousands of emails from the public to municipal and provincial politicians including all of the provincial party leaders from our web site
2159453 over and over these people are demanding provincial action for fair solutions to the citys financial challenge we hope they are not ignored
2159454 the public expects strong provincial action and an immediate signal to toronto city council that a second land transfer tax is not a fair option

2159511 saya ingin berusaha sendiri sebab dari dulu bekerja pada orang lain terus
2159512 bisa juga begitu bangun terus ke kantor dan ke gym malam hari
2159513 coba coba saja buat usaha sendiri kebetulan saya suka makan
2159514 siapa lagi yang bisa menjadi guru terbaik selain orang tua
2159515 saya tidak mempunyai pengalaman dalam dunia bisnis sehingga banyak tanya sana sini
2159516 meskipun saya mendapat bantuan modal dari orang tua tetapi hitungannya tetap utang
2159517 modal awalnya dikumpullkan dari teman teman masing masing rp 500 ribu
2159518 kalau membuat usaha buatlah usaha yang nantinya dicari orang sekalipun jualan bakso

2159522 waktu itu tidak ada bank yang mau mengucurkan kredit hampir tiap hari di awal awal merintis bisnis kami selalu menangis gara gara dimaki klien
2159523 saat krismon orang tidak mau beriklan di jalur above the line karena biayanya mahal sehingga harus dicarikan alternatifnya

2159531 saya surprise juga saat dipercaya mengelola bids padahal tim yang ada sudah senior semua dan rata rata menyandang gelar ph d
2159532 kalau voxa dan innovoxa akan pitching saya bisa tiap hari ke sana usai jam kantor
2159533 sebenarnya saya termasuk orang yang sulit menerima tawaran orang namun entah kenapa saya tertarik ajakan pak maher
2159534 jika kami tidak menyenangi bisnis ini pasti kerugian itu terasa berat
2159535 pada awal merintis bisnis saya tidak memiliki tukang sehingga sangat tergantung supplier pengalaman ini membuat saya tahu dan mencoba mencari resep sendiri
2159536 saya searching di internet ternyata belum ada orang yang merancang interior tempat biliar seserius kami
2159537 namanya juga bisnis yang berusrusan dengan perut kepuasan seorangv pelanggan akan ditularkan kepada banyak orang sehingga lebih efektif
2159538 saat itu sebagai pemula bisnis food and beverage kami tidak muluk muluk pasang target
2159539 saya tidak seperti itu saya memberikan kebebasan bagi anak saya membangun bisnisnya sendiri

2159556 i think people who have made the effort to turn out to vote deserve to see the faces of their candidates
2159557 this is undoubtedly the smartest polling station people have made many approving comments we even met people who used to ride out from these stables when they were owned by bruce hobbs
2159558 election officers do need to remember people like to fit voting into their routine they do not want to walk from st marys away from the town centre so why not use the turner hall instead then they can vote on their way into town to do their shopping
2159559 people have been very supportive of our approach taking tough but correct decisions residents in freshfields have even asked to be included in the consideration of residents parking schemes

2159565 daca hristos n a inviat atunci zadarnica este propovaduirea noastra zadarnica i credinta voastra
2159566 nelinistit este sufletul meu doamne pana ce se va odihni in tine
2159567 iar din pomul cunoasterii binelui si raului sa nu mananci caci in ziua in care vei manca din el vei muri negresit
2159568 pe adam din stricaciune cu neamul sau l ai inviat impreuna cu tine
2159569 unde ti este moarte boldul unde ti este iadule biruinta
2159570 aceasta este ziua care a facut o domnul sa ne luminam si sa ne bucuram intr insa
2159571 aceasta minunata si sfanta zi una a sambetelor imparateasa si doamna al prazincelor praznic si sarbatoare este sarbatorilor
2159572 sa ne curatim simtirile si sa vedem pe hristos in lumina cea neapropiata a invierii
2159573 hristoase o pastile cele mari cele sfintite da ne noua sa ne impartasim cu tine in ziua cea neinserata a imparatiei tale
2159574 cerurile dupa cuviinta sa se veseleasca si pamantul sa se bucure si sa praznuiasca toata lumea cea vazuta si cea nevazuta ca hristos s a sculat veselia cea vesnica
2159575 acum toate s au umplut de lumina si cerul si pamantul si cele dedesubt
2159576 daca vreun episcop sau presbiter sau diacon sau ipodiacon sau citet sau cantaret nu posteste sfantul si marele post al pastelor sau miercurea si vinerea sa se cateriseasca fara numai daca va fi impiedicat de slabiciunea trupului iar daca va fi laic sa se afuriseasca
2159577 post postim carele au postit domnul hristos sfantul si marele care se chiama si iaste pareasimile cu curatie si pentru a noastra iertare si mancam o data in zi sec dupa vecernie si legumi fara untdelemn iar peaste nicicum fara numai in ziua blagovesteniilor de acia nicicum
2159578 cine va dazlega miercurea si vinerea acela rastigneste pe hristos ca si ovreaii pentru ca miercurea s au vandut iar vineri s au rastignit
2159579 muiarea care va naste in postul mare sau in saptamana cea mare aceea sa nu tie de poruncitul post a se posti de untdelemn si de vin ce fara de pacat sa manance si sa bea pentru ca postul pentru smerenia trupului se au facut iara ea aflandu se bolnava si slaba ceare si priimeste hrana ca sa ia putere si sanatate si altcineva carele va fi slab si bolnav nu se opreste da zilele carele sunt poruncite a le posti ce sa manance untdelemn si vin iar carne sa nu manance macar de s ar afla si la moarte cum graieste valsamon la povestea canonului 68 apostolic
2159580 tineti postul de 40 de zile cand se face pomenire de ce a facut mantuitorul si de invataturile lui
2159581 mantuitorul ne a poruncit sa postim aceste sase zile din cauza nelegiuirii si nedreptatii iudeilor el ne a prescris sa i plangem si sa tanguim ruina lor caci el insusi i a plans pentru ca nu l a luat in seama atunci cand a fost printre ei el ne recomanda sa postim miercurea si vinerea din cauza patimilor
2159582 nu mancati decat paine sare si legume si ca bautura apa
2159583 dar vor veni zile cand mirele se va lua de la ei atunci in acele zile vor posti
2159584 crestinii petrecand zilele mantuitoarei patimi in post si rugaciune si intru umilinta inimii trebuie ca in ceasurile de la miezul nopii din sambata mare sa se incheie postul fiindca dumnezeiestii evanghelisti matei si luca cel dintai prin cuvintele
2159585 pana cand incepe sa se lumineze de ziua in prima zi a saptamanii mt 28 1 adica dumineca ramaneti trezi de seara pana la cantatul cocosului si adunati in biserica veghiati rugandu va invocand pe dumnezeu in timpul privegherii citind legea profetii si psalmii pana la cantatul cocosului apoi dupa ce au fost botezati catehumenii s a citit evanghelia cu frica si cu cutremur si s a predicat poporului despre mantuire puneti capat doliului si rugati pe dumnezeu ca israeleul sa se converteasca si sa i fie dat un prilej de convertire si iertare pentru faradelegea sa
2159586 fiindca domnul a inviat voi sa aduceti jertfa voastra caci in aceasta privinta vi s a aratat aceasta opriti atunci postul bucurati va si fiti in sarbatoare pentru ca parga invierii voastre iisus hristos a inviat din morti i cor 15 20 si aceasta va fi mereu pana la sfarsitul lumii mt 28 20 pana la venirea domnului i cor 11 26 caci pentru iudei domnul este inca mort iar pentru crestini el a inviat pentru primii aceasta tine de necredinta lor iar pentru cei de al doilea de deplina convingere ca nadejdea in domnul este viata fara de moarte si vesnica
2159587 de la sfanta zi a invierii lui hristos dumnezeul nostru pana la duminica noua toata saptamana se cuvine ca credinciosii sa o petreaca negresit in sfintele biserici cu psalmi laude si cantari duhovnicesti veselindu se si serband intru hristos si luand aminte la citirea dumnezeiestilor scripturi si desfatandu se cu sfintele taine caci asa in veci vom fi impreuna inaltati deci aratatele zile nicidecum sa nu se faca alergari de cai sau alt spectacol poporal
2159588 cand sosesc zilele pastelor se sarbatoresc astfel dupa cum la noi se postesc 40 de zile inainte de pasti tot asa aici se postesc opt saptamani din pricina ca in dumineci si in sambete nu se posteste cu exceptia unei singure sambete in care este ajunul pastelor si trebuie sa se posteasca in afara de sambata aceasta absolut niciodata nu se posteste aici sambata in tot cursul anului daca deci din opt saptamani se scad opt dumineci si sapte sambete pentru ca intr o sambata trebuie sa se posteasca asa precum am mai spus inainte raman patruzeci si una de zile de post care numesc sarbatori adica paresimi
2159589 nimeni nu impune cat trebuie postit ci fiecare atata cat poate si nici cel care posteste mai mult nu este laudat nici cel care posteste mai putin nu este dispretuit asa este aici obiceiul
2159590 si cel ce mananca pentru domnul mananca fiindca i multumeste lui dumnezeu si cel ce nu mananca pentru domul nu manaca si i multumeste lui dumnezeu
2159591 duminica la primul cantat al cocosului episcopul citeste in biserica invierii locul din evanghelie despre invierea domnului cum se face in duminici peste tot anul si de asemenea pana la ziua se savarsesc la biserica invierii si la cea a crucii cele ce sa fac in toate duminecile de peste an 25 continuarea are loc in biserica mare dupa care se revine in biserica invierii vecernia se face tot aici dar tot la ceasul al 9 lea 26 luni marti si joi slujbele sunt la fel incep dupa cantatul cocosului in biserica invierii se continua la momentele respective cu ceasurile 3 6 9 si cu vecernia
2159592 dupa ce s a facut otpustul poporul conduce pe episcop cu cantari pana la biserica invierii se potriveste venirea astfel incat ca sa intre in biserica invierii cam la ceasul vecerniei se intoneaza imne si antifoane se fac rugaciuni iar otpustul vecerniei in biserica invierii si in biserica crucii
2159593 cand ajunge episcopul aici il intampina toti monahii poporul intra si el inauntru se intoneaza un imn si un antifon si se citeste locul din evanghelie unde se spune ca sora lui lazar a intampinat pe domnul se face o rugaciune si tot fiind binecuvantati de catre episcop se merge pana in lazarium cu cantari
2159594 cand s a ajuns in lazarium se aduna aici toata multimea incat nu numai locasul insusi ci si toate campurile din jur sunt pline de oameni
2159595 biserica eleona adica pe muntele maslinilor unde este grota in care invata domnul
2159596 caci poporul totdeauna cand episcopul este prezent este poftit sa sada in picioare ramanand continuu numai diaconii se intoneaza si aici imnuri si antifoane potrivite cu locul si ziua se fac de asemenea citiri alternate cu rugaciuni
2159597 si indata se ridica episcopul cu tot poporul si atunci se merge din varful muntelui numai pe picioare
2159598 dar si doamnele si barbatii de vaza cati sunt conduc pe episcop intonand refrenul
2159599 la ceas de noapte toti merg la biserica de pe muntele maslinilor
2159600 cand se citeste acest text poporul atata plange si suspina incat nu se afla nimeni care sa nu fie miscat pana la lacrimi in ceasul acela
2159601 acolo cam pana la al cincilea ceas din noapte ora 23 neintrerupt se intoneaza imnuri si antifoane se fac rugaciuni in legatura cu ziua si locul si se citeste evanghelia in care domnul a vorbit ucenicilor sai in aceasta zi stand in grota care este in aceasta biserica
2159602 cand incepe cantatul cocosilor se coboara din imbomon cu cantari la locul unde s a rugat domnul precum este scris in evanghelie
2159603 cand se citeste acest text atat de mare este vaietul suspinul si plansul intregului popor incat geamatul general razbate aproape pana la oras
2159604 cand s a ajuns inaintea locului crucii incepe sa se lumineze se citeste aici locul din evanghelie in care se spune cum domnul a fost adus la pilat si toate cate se scriu ce a spus pilat domnului ori iudeilor
2159605 dupa aceea espiscopul vorbeste poporului imbarbatand pe credinciosi caci s au ostenit toata noaptea si inca vor mai avea de ostenit si in acea zi ca sa nu oboseasca ci sa aiba credinta in dumnezeu care pentru osteneala lor le va darui o rasplata mare si incurajandu i astfel pe cat poate vorbind le spune duceti va acum pentru putin timp fiecare la locuintele voastre odihniti va putin si catre ceasul al doilea din zi ora 7 dimineata sa fiti toti gata aici pentru ca de la acel ceas pana la al saselea sa puteti vedea lemnul crucii fiecare din voi crezand ca aceasta va fi folositor pentru mantuirea voastra caci de la ceasul al salselea inainte trebuie sa ne adunam iarasi in acest loc adica in locul din fata crucii ca sa ne indeletnicim cu citirile si cu rugaciunile pana la noapte
2159606 dupa aceasta sfarsindu se slujba de la locul crucii adica inainte de rasaritul soarelui indata toti plini de ravna merg in sion sa se roage la stalpul coloana la care a fost biciuit domnul
2159607 si astfel tot poporul trece rad pe rand plecandu si toti capetele si atingand crucea si tablita titulum intai cu fruntea apoi cu ochii si sarutand astfel crucea trec mai departe dar nimeni nu pune mana sa le atinga dupa ce au sarutat crucea trec mai departe un diacon in picioare tine inelul lui solomon si cornul din care se ungeau regii se saruta cornul se cinsteste inelul pana la ceasul al saselea tot poporul trece intrand pe o usa si iesind pe alta pentru ca se face aceasta in locul in care in ajun adica joi s a facut liturghia
2159608 si cand s a facut ceasul al saselea din zi ora 12 se merge la locul din fata crucii fie ca ploua fie ca este cald pentru ca locul se afla sub cerul liber adica este un fel de atrium foarte mare si foarte frumos situat intre cruce si biserica invierii
2159609 i se pune episcopului jetul in fata locul crucii si de la ceasul al saselea pana la ceasul al noualea se citesc texte biblice din vechiul si noul testament cu tot ceea ce s a proorocit despre sfintele patimi in cele trei ceasuri se invata poporul ca nimic nu s a facut care sa nu fi fost proorocit si nimic nu s a spus care sa nu se fi implinit in intregime
2159610 la fiecare lectura si rugaciune se face atat de mare induiosare si planset in tot poporul incat este uluitor caci nu este nimeni mai mare sau mai mic care sa nu planga in acea zi in timpul celor trei ceasuri atat cat nu se poate spune ca domnul a patimit acestea pentru noi apoi cand se apropie ceasul al noualea ora 15 se citeste locul din evanghelia lui ioan unde domnul si a dat duhul in 19 30 dupa aceasta citire se face o rugaciune si sfarsitul
2159611 privegheaza o multime foarte mare unii de cu seara altii de la miezul noptii care cum pot
2159612 episcopul cu tot clerul cei de curand botezati cu aputacticii barbati si femei si chiar dintre poporeni cati vor urca la biserica eleona de pe muntele maslinilor
2159613 or la anumite ceasuri ale zilei constantin se zavora in ascunzisul celor mai ferite camari ale palatului singur cu dumnezeul sau cel unul caruia ingenunchind fierbinte l cerea in rugaciune ceea ce avea el mai mult nevoie ca un adevarat partas al lucrurilor de taina pentru zilele mantuitoarei sarbatori a pastelui isi prelungea mult reculegerea praznuind o in sfintele i slujbe cu toate puterile sufletesti si trupesti adunate cu totul daruit unei vieti pline de har si prin asta pe toti partasii la praznic intrecandu i sfanta veghe de noapte o prelungea pana n zi anumiti oameni trimisi de el aprindeau pe intreg cuprinsul orasului lumanari lungi de ceara carora li se adaugau facliile aprinse la tot pasul ceea ce facea ca tainica noapte a veghii sa ajunga in cele din urma mai daruita cu lumina decat miezul zilei iar in zori dupa pilda mantuitoarelor revarsari de dar ale inverii isi intindea si imparatul generosul sau brat peste toate provinciile si neamurile si popoarele imparatiei tuturor facandu le daruri bogate
2159614 dupa savarsirea primelor indatoriri ale praznicului pastilor constantin a petrecut mantuitoarea sarbatoare cu fast si bucurie multa facand din ea si pentru sine si pentru ceilalti un prilej de implinire in care a zabovit pana in ultimile i clipe din viata cand dumnezeu l a gasit vrednic la sorocul potrivit sa fie mutat la o viata mai buna
2159615 impartit a dat a saracilor dreptatea lui ramane in veac
2159616 prin putrerea inverii dumnezeiesti razboiul cu moartea s a incheiat
2159617 razele luminii inaccesibile au stralucit peste mortii care erau in intuneric caci pe hristos l am vazut mort in mormant omorand moartea cu moartea sa el a ridicat odata cu el pe cei cuprinsi de moarte prin invierea sa cea de a treia zi fie ca el sa va pazeasca in glorie o suveranilor intru multi ani
2159618 astazi creatia este in stralucire ea sarbatoreste marea si cinstita taina a invierii domnul biruintei ne a salvat de tristetea mortii si a stapanirii iadului caci a inviat odata cu el pe mortii de pana acum el desavarseste in chip minunat bucuria noastra de nespus si pastile cel dumnezeieisc puterea voastra imparatilor este marita spre gloria mandria si incantarea rhomeilor
2159619 astazi taina invierii ascunsa ingerilor s a implinit cel care a umplut de bunavointa orice fiinta a murit in carne ca om dar a inrobit lacomia tiranica a iadului omorand pe autorul mortii acum rusinea vremurilor trecute s a sters acum a inflorit bucuria sfarsitului vremii noastre doamne dumnezeule stapane care dai viata pazeste pe imparati in purpura
2159620 astazi firea oamenilor s a innoit schimbata in chip minunat din stricacioasa in nestricacioasa ea s a imbracat in haina primei straluciri si nu mai este supusa mortii cel care are putere asupra mortii cuvantul din veac impreuna cu tatal a ruinat stapanirea iadului a rupt legaturile celor robiti si ne a dat tuturor libertatea fie ca el sa pazeasca domnia voastra in stralucire cinste spre slava romeilor
2159621 in acest timp hanul cinstit de avari a adunat ostile in jurul sau si s a indreptat spre tracia si moesia apoi a impresurat cetatea tomis afland despre acestea priscus s a apropiat sa dea ajutor cetatii amenintate desi romanii si barbarii au tabarat in jurul orasului tomis venind timpul iernii nu si au mai desfacut taberele la inceputul primaverii in randurile romanilor a izbucnit foametea cand urma sa se apropie marea sarbatoare a crestinilor si sa fie praznuite patimile si invierea mantuitorului iar romanii erau chinuiti de foame dintr o purtare de grija neasteptata hanul a trimis soli la romani cererea lui era sa puna capat foametei iar priscus statea la indoiala si nu avea incredere in aceasta propunere neobisnuita dupa ce romanii si barbarii au dat si au primit cuvant de credinta au hotarat un armistitiu de cinci zile si au incetat sa se mai teama unii de altii deci hanul a trimis romanilor infometati care cu alimente de aceea a staruit pana in zilele noastre amintirea acestei marinimii neobisnuite a barbarilor in a patra zi cand si armata romana avea din belsug lucrurile cele mai de trebuinta pentru trai hanul a trimis soli si a cerut de la priscus mirodenii din india comandantul a onorat cererea barbarului si i a trimis piper frunza de dafin din india scortisoara si asa zisul cost barbarul a luat darurile romane a gustat mirodeniile si s a bucurat nespus de mult deci au intrerupt luptele pana ce au trecut marea sarbatoare indragita de multime cele doua osti potrivnice se intalneau impreuna in corturi si nici una nu se temea de cealalta dupa trecerea sarbatorilor hanul a trimis soli si a cerut ca ostile sa se desparta una de alta si astfel barbarii s au separat de romani
2159622 era ca sa zic asa neostoit in cele mai multe imprejurari si niciodata nu tinea sa se sature de mancare si bautura ci le atingea doar cu varful degetelor si apoi se scula de la masa deoarece credea ca asemenea lucruri sunt un adaos fara insemnatate si o povara a firii de aceea deseori postea doua zile si doua nopti mai ales in preajma sarbatorilor pastilor
2159623 priscus a pornit spre antiohia si a poruncit ostenilor sa se adune la monocarton iar el insusi s a dus la edesa si s a intalnit cu germanus l a primit cu marinimie l a imbratisat dupa sosire caci acesta isi avea scaunul in damasc l a invitat in ziua urmatoare la pranz si i a aratat bunavointa
2159624 nu se cuvine ca episcopul sa sarbatoreasca ziua invierii in cetate iar oastea romana s o sarbatoreasca undeva afara pe camp ca si cum ar fi exclusa de la bucuriile cetatii
2159625 nachdem die byzantinischen truppen in preslav die auferstehung des heilands 16
2159626 zi plina de bucurie si de veselie astazi s a aratat ca lumineaza lumina dogmelor celor prea adevarate si staluceste biserica lui hristos impodobindu se acum cu inaltarea sfintelor icoane si cu stralucirile chipurilor si se face credinciosilor unire de dumnezeu daruita

2159638 the maps used to carve up the african continent were mostly inaccurate large areas were described as terra incognito when marking out the boundaries of their new territories european negotiators frequently resorted to drawing straight lines on the map taking little or no account of the myriad of traditional monarchies chiefdoms and other african societies that existed on the ground nearly one half of the new frontiers imposed on africa were geometric lines lines of latitude and longitude other straight lines or arcs of circles in some cases african societies were rent apart the bakongo were partitioned between french congo belgian congo and portuguese angola somaliland was carved up between britain italy and france in all the new boundaries cut through some 190 cultural groups in other cases europes new colonial territories enclosed hundreds of diverse and independent groups with no common history culture language or religion nigeria for example contained as many as 250 ethnolinguistic groups officials sent to the belgian congo eventually identified six thousand chiefdoms there
2159639 kingdoms that had been historically antagonistic to one another such as the buganda and bunyoro in uganda were linked into the same colony in the sahel new territories were established across the great divide between the desert regions of the sahara and the belt of tropical forests to the south sudan chad nigeria throwing together muslim and non muslim peoples in latent hostility

2159757 aktifitas di desa bisa dibilang monoton hampir tiap hari kecuali hari minggu saya harus ke sawah mencangkul membibit menanam padi merumput sawah menyemprot tanaman memanen sampai menjemur padi selain itu saya masih harus memasak mencuci piring mencuci pakaian menyapu rumah menyiram halaman di desa tidak ada istilah pembantu seperti di kota di kota anak muda dan remaja hampir tidak punya tugas seperti yang saya lakukan mereka punya banyak waktu untuk belajar ikut bimbingan belajar les musik olah raga liburan atau refreshing ke pantai atau ke tempat tempat hiburan kontras dengan kehidupan remaja di desa
2159758 pikiran untuk keluar dari desa sudah ada sejak di smp
2159759 ketika di smp sudah ada pikiran untuk keluar dari desa begitu
2159760 ya apalagi setelah kerabat yang merantau ke jakarta berceritera tentang kehidupan di jakarta terutama ceritera tentang itb ini sangat memotivasi saya saya semakin semangat dan rajin belajar kuliah di itb itu cita cita yang terselip dalam pikiran
2159761 setelah lulus dari sma saya minta pada ayah agar memberi izin pergi ke bandung untuk ikut ujian masuk perguruan tinggi negeri waktu itu sudah diterima di usu di jurusan teknik elektro lewat pmdk jalur masuk ke perguruan tinggi bagi siswa siswa berprestasi di sma tanpa ikut ujian masuk perguruan tinggi ayah bilang tidak usahlah ke bandung di usu juga bisa jadi insiniur tapi saya ngotot agar diberi izin ke bandung akhirnya izin diberikan dengan catatan saya akan kembali lagi ke medan
2159762 alasan lain ingin ke bandung masih ada prestasi akademik belum teruji tidak puas kalau yang saya pelajari selama ini belum diuji lewat ujian masuk perguruan tinggi
2159763 saya berangkat ke bandung dengan menumpang kapal laut tampomas setiba di jakarta besoknya diantar saudara ke stasiun bis cilitan dan dari sana saya berangkat sendirian ke bandung
2159764 di bandung saya mendaftar mengisi formulir dan ikut ujian setelah mengikuti ujian saya merasa tidak bakal lulus sebab jumlah pertanyaan yang dijawab benar hanya 84 dari 200 soal ini menurut jawaban yang beredar pada waktu itu jadi ada pikiran pasti tidak diterima di
2159765 setelah diuji baru tahu apakah lulus atau tidak memang harus begitu lewat ujian kita baru tahu apakah kita sudah tahu atau belum
2159766 karena tidak punya harapan lulus saya kembali ke jakarta untuk seterusnya kembali ke medan agar nama saya di usu tidak dicoret karena terlambat mendaftar
2159767 beberapa hari sebelum berangkat ke medan masih sempat jalan jalan ke ancol dan berfoto di sana mungkin ini terakhir bagi saya datang ke jawa pikirku
2159768 nama nama yang lulus masuk perguruan tinggi diumumkan di koran saya membeli koran suara karya di bawah jembatan layang cawang saya membacanya tapi tidak begitu antusias karena merasa bakal tidak lulus hati tidak dag dig dug saya baca judul jurusan elektro pilihan pertama nama saya tidak ada kemudian saya baca judul teknik perminyakan pilihan kedua nama saya ada saya tidak percaya saya menutup mata dan saya baca lagi nama saya tetap ada karena tidak percaya saya suruh saudara yang waktu itu bersama saya untuk baca apakah nama saya ada tanya saya ya jawabnya saya langsung meloncat loncat kegirangan di bawah jembatan cawang saya senang luar biasa bukan karena diterima di itb tapi karena saya berpikir bahwa saya tidak akan hidup di desa dan tidak ke sawah lagi
2159769 itulah salah satu peristiwa yang paling menggembirakan dalam hidup saya dan sejak itu saya meninggalkan desa kecuali ketika pulang kampung mengunjungi orang tua
2159770 ya keinginan untuk sekolah di smun 1 medan sebenarnya datang dari abang ayah amang tua dalam bahasa batak ide ini ia berikan di depan banyak undangan keluarga pada acara lepas sidi di rumah amang tua bilang sma harus di medan saya senang termotivasi untuk belajar dan kata kata itu selalu saya ingat
2159771 amang tua memang relatif berhasil hidupnya ia orang kantoran dan bekerja di kadin sumatera utara ia juga sudah punya rumah agak besar di medan jl mongonsidi i no 22
2159772 setelah lulus smp ayah dan saya berangkat ke medan untuk mendaftar di smun 1 kami naik sepeda motor saya mengisi formulir ujian masuk setelah mendaftar dan mendapat normor ujian saya sempatkan melihat laboratorium smun 1 medan saya akan sekolah di sini
2159773 setelah urusan pendaftaran selesai kami berangkat ke rumah amang tua tapi tidak bertemu dengan amang tua karena ia dinas ke luar kota kami hanya bertemu dengan isterinya inang tua ayah pun bicara tentang rencana ingin sekolah di smun 1 medan
2159774 setelah selesai bicara dengan inang tua kami pulang sambil mengendarai motor di jalan bilang sama ayah saya tidak mau sekolah di smun 1 medan kalau karena uang saya sekolah di smun lubuk pakam saja
2159775 sore itu itu juga saya mendaftar ke smun lubuk pakam dengan nomor urut no 537 dan setelah testing masuk smun lubuk pakam saya diterima dan masuk kelas i 1 mimpi sekolah di smun 1 medan hanya tinggal mimpi gara gara isu uang suap rp 50 000
2159776 uang suap sering membuat orang orang yang punya potensi tidak mendapat kesempatan untuk mengecap pendidikan yang bagus namun pendidikan tidak hanya semata mata soal mutu sekolah kerajinan keuletan dan belajar tekun juga sangat berperan ada orang yang lulus dari smu kota kecil tapi bisa belajar sampai ke luar negeri karena dapat beasiswa
2159777 saya dapat banyak pelajaran dari kehidupan orang lain biografi otobiografi dan kisah nyata yang dilihat sendiri
2159778 biografi tentang john calvin martin luther penginjil hudson taylor billy graham abraham lincoln john f kennedy soekarno t b simatupang dan biografi lain pernah saya baca banyak inspirasi dan pelajaran yang dipetik dari kehidupan mereka
2159779 pengalaman orang bisa jadi contoh bagi kita maupun bagi orang yang hidup di masa mendatang
2159780 sejarah adalah guru yang baik kalau kita menghargai sejarah kita dapat belajar banyak bisa jadi bekal untuk menjalani hidup jadi bagaimana kisah hidupmu
2159781 baiklah saya cerita dulu secara singkat latar belakang keluarga saya lahir di medan pada tahun 1963 tapi dibesarkan di desa kurang lebih 19 tahun kehidupan di desa tidak jauh dengan kehidupan bertani semenjak sd sampai sma saya banyak bergulat dengan kehidupan bertani mencangkul menanam benih menanam padi merumput menyemprot hama padi dan memanen di rumah pun masih harus memasak mencuci piring menyapu rumah mencuci dan menyeterika pakaian
2159782 didikan keluarga relatif keras terutama dari ibu ia tidak sabar melihat kami malas kalau bangun pagi terlambat ibu langsung memanggil manggil dengan suara agak keras bahkan mencubit kaki kalau belum juga bangun begitu kerasnya suaranya sampai terdengar oleh tetangga
2159783 ibu tipe pekerja keras tetapi hasil kerja di sawah tidak baik hasil kerjanya harus diulangi merumput misalnya ayah harus mengerjakan ulang apa yang dikerjakan ibu
2159784 ibu mempunyai naluri bisnis yang baik hampir semua pembelian tanah atau sawah ia prakarsai bahkan penjualan sawah agar bisa membeli sawah lain pernah ia lakukan tanpa konsultasi dengan ayah
2159785 professi ibu adalah bidan ia punya balai pengobatan umum tulisannya tidak terbaca tapi ia ingat siapa yang punya hutang dan berapa
2159786 berbeda dengan ibu ayah tipe pekerja ulet dan rajin bahkan sering lupa untuk istirahat kalau kerja hasil kerjanya rapi apa saja yang dikerjakan selalu apik mulai dari merumput membuat kandang ayam membuat meja memasak menggiling cabe mencuci pakaian menyeterika pakaian tulisannya juga rapi ia punya administrasi dokumen yang baik oleh karena kerajinan dan kerapiannya ia sering dipercaya jadi sekretaris di gereja kumpulan sosial bahkan di instansi kesehatan tingkat kabupaten penampilannya rapi bahkan oleh para bidan dikira pejabat karena sering berpakaian jas mini anak anaknya tidak bisa meniru cara kerja ayah
2159787 ayah dan ibu rajin dan aktif dalam kehidupan gereja semasih di bangku sd bahkan sampai sma hampir tiap malam kami menyanyikan pujian membaca alkitab dan berdoa ketika orang tua berdoa saya dan adik sering mengantuk bahkan sering berdoa dengan satu mata terbuka dan satu tertutup
2159788 oleh karena pengabdian belasan tahun di gereja dua kali ayah mendapat penghargaan berupa salib emas satu dari gereja tingkat resort satu lagi dari gereja di desa setelah menjadi majelis gereja selama kurang lebih 30 tahun
2159789 adik hanya satu orang sempat ada adik perempuan tetapi tuhan mengambilnya ketika ia berumur 3 tahun itulah sekilas latar belakang keluarga
2159790 kehidupan sulit di desa memaksa mereka untuk berpikir dan berjuang keras untuk memperbaiki hidupnya ada yang berhasil dan menemukan hidup yang benar dan banyak juga yang berhasil tapi
2159791 apa alasan memilih teknik perminyakan ketika mau mendaftar di perguruan tinggi
2159792 ketika mengisi formulir pendaftaran saya tidak ragu membuat pilihan pertama dengan cepat saya mengisi formulir dan memilih teknik elektro pilihan yang sudah ada sejak sma saya senang belajar matematika dan fisika dan selalu dapat nilai bagus pada dua mata pelajaran ini jadi saya tidak begitu banyak berpikir membuat pilihan pertama tapi ketika mau membuat pilihan kedua saya agak lama berpikir tidak punya alternatif
2159793 waktu itu di desa informasi semacam itu tidak ada minim lah informasi tentang self assessment jadi agak lama saya mempertimbangkan pilihan kedua sementara keinginan kuliah di bandung sangat besar bahkan sudah terpikir yang penting kuliah di bandung
2159794 waktu itu ada berita kalau rating pilihan pertama dan kedua berdekatan maka kalau tidak lulus testing pada pilihan pertama kemungkinan besar gagal pada pilihan kedua jadi saya ingin menghindar dari hal ini
2159795 ketika hasil ujian masuk perguruan tinggi negeri diumumkan di koran saya diterima di jurusan teknik perminyakan sejak itu saya mengembara di padang pasir selama 14 tahun
2159796 jadi kamu memilih jurusan teknik perminyakan karena alasan yang pragmatis
2159797 pilihan pilihan sejenis ini memang paling menarik buat manusia banyak keputusan kita dimotivasi oleh uang judika malau

2159859 yes but reiko the reality is that were mere diversions for these men they come to us precisely because were nothing like their wives and concubines so we cant expect them to come to us every evening or us to go to them every morning to pay our respects

2159868 berpuasalah kalian karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya hilal bulan syawal jika kalian terhalang awan maka sempurnakanlah syaban tiga puluh hari
2159869 janganlah kalian mendahului bulan ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali seseorang diantara kalian yang biasa berpuasa padanya
2159870 apabila datang bulan ramadhan maka berpuasalah 30 hari kecuali sebelum itu kalian melihat hilal
2159871 puasalah karena melihatnya hilal dan berbukalah karena melihatnya jika awan menghalangi kalian sempurnakanlah tiga puluh hari jika dua orang saksi mempersaksikan ruyah hilal maka berpuasalah dan berbukalah kalian karenanya
2159872 manusia sedang melihat lihat munculnya hilal aku beritahukan kepada nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam bahwa aku melihatnya maka beliau berpuasa dan memerintahkan manusia untuk berpuasa
2159873 kuraib mengabarkan bahwa ummu fadll bintul harits mengutusnya kepada muawiyyah di syam
2159874 aku sampai di syam kemudian aku memenuhi keperluannya dan diumumkan tentang hilal ramadhan sedangkan aku masih berada di syam
2159875 para ulama berbeda pendapat tentang hal ini atas beberapa pendapat
2159876 keharusan ruyah bagi setiap negeri yang tidak samar atas mereka hilal
2159877 tidak harus sama jika berbeda dua arah yakni tinggi dan rendah yang menyebabkan salah satunya mudah melihat hilal dan yang lain sulit atau bagi setiap negeri mempunyai iklim hal ini diceritakan oleh al mahdi dalam al bahr dari imam yahya dan hadawiyah
2159878 orang orang yang menyatakan bahwa ruyah tidak digunakan bagi semuanya negeri negeri seperti kebanyakan pengikut pengikut madzhab syafii diantaranya mereka ada yang membatasi dengan jarak qashar shalat ada yang membatasi dengan perbedaan mathla seperti hijaz dengan syam iraq dengan khurasan pendapat kedua duanya lemah karena jarak qashar shalat tidak berkaitan dengan hilal apabila seseorang menyaksikan pada malam ke 30 bulan syaban di suatu tempat dekat maupun jauh maka wajib puasa demikian juga kalau menyaksikan hilal pada waktu siang menjelang maghrib maka harus imsak berpuasa untuk waktu yang tersisa sama saja baik satu iklim atau banyak iklim
2159879 apabila penduduk suatu negeri melihat hilal maka seluruh negeri harus mengikutinya
2159880 saya demi allah tidak mengetahui apa yang menghalangi sayyid sabiq sehingga dia memilih pendapat yang syadz ganjil ini dan enggan mengambil keumuman hadits yang shahih dan merupakan pendapat jumhur ulama sebagaimana yang dia sebutkan sendiri
2159881 puasa kalian adalah hari kalian berpuasa dan berbuka kalian iedul fithri adalah hari kalian berbuka tidak berpuasa dan adha kalian adalah hari kalian berkurban
2159882 sanadnya jayyid dan rawi rawinya semuanya tsiqah lihat silsilah al hadits as shahihah 1 440
2159883 sebagian ahlu ilmi ulama mentafsirkan hadits ini bahwa puasa dan iedul fithri bersama mayoritas manusia
2159884 dalam hadits itu terdapat dalil bahwa hari ied ditetapkan bersama manusia orang yang mengetahui hari ied dengan ruyah sendirian wajib baginya untuk mencocoki lainnya dan mengharuskan dia untuk mengikuti mereka didalam shalat iedul fithri dan iedul adha
2159885 dikatakan bahwa di dalam hadits itu terdapat bantahan terhadap orang yang mengatakan bahwa barangsiapa mengetahui terbitnya bulan dengan perkiraan hisab boleh baginya untuk berpuasa dan berbuka berbeda dengan orang yang tidak tahu juga dikatakan makna yang terkandung dalam hadits itu bahwa saksi satu orang apabila melihat hilal sedangkan hakim tidak menerima persaksiannya maka dia tidak boleh berpuasa sebagaimana manusia tidak berpuasa
2159886 yang jelas maknanya adalah bahwa perkara perkara ini bukan untuk perorangan tidak boleh bersendirian dalam hal itu perkaranya tetap diserahkan kepada imam dan jamaah atas dasar ini jika seseorang melihat hilal sedangkan imam menolak persaksiannya maka seharusnya tidak diakui dan wajib atasnya untuk mengikuti jamaah pada yang demikian itu
2159887 nahr adalah hari manusia menyembelih kurban dan iedul fithri adalah hari manusia berbuka
2159888 pendapat yang masyhur dalam madzhab imam ahmad adalah wajib puasa pada waktu itu
2159889 apabila kalian melihat hilal ramadhan maka puasalah dan apabila melihatnya hilal syawal maka berbukalah jika mendung atas kalian maka kira kirakanlah
2159890 barang siapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka dia sungguh telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
2159891 tidak berpuasa pada saat itu adalah madzhab imam ahmad imam ahmad juga mengatakan bahwa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan adalah mendahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu hari sungguh nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam telah melarang hal itu yang masih diragukan adalah tentang wajibnya berpuasa pada hari itu padahal tidak wajib dilakukan bahkan yang disunnahkan adalah meninggalkannya kalau dikatakan boleh dua perkara maka sunnah untuk berbuka itu lebih utama
2159892 aku tidak mendapatkan dari ahmad bahwa beliau menegaskan wajibnya dan memerintahkannya maka janganlah pendapat diatas dinisbatkan kepadanya
2159893 tidak diragukan lagi bahwa para peneliti dari kalangan madzhab hambali dan selainnya berpendapat tentang tidak wajibnya berpuasa bahkan dimakruhkan atau diharamkan
2159894 ketahuilah bahwa hari yang diragukan adalah hari ke 30 dari bulan syaban apabila tidak terlihat hilal pada malam itu karena ada awan yang menghalangi atau selainnya bisa jadi saat itu bulan ramadhan atau syaban dan makna hadits ammar dan selainnya menunjukkan atas haramnya puasa pada saat itu
2159895 janganlah kalian dahului ramadhan dengan puasa satu atau dua hari kecuali orang yang biasa berpuasa bertepatan pada hari itu maka puasalah
2159896 barangsiapa berpuasa pada hari yang diragukan maka sungguh dia telah bermaksiat kepada abul qasim shallallahu alaihi wa sallam
2159897 hadits diatas sebagai dalil bahwa shalat ied dilaksanakan hari kedua tatkala waktu ied diketahui dengan jelas sesuadah keluar habis waktu shalat
