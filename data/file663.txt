6630044 we need a jeffersonian revolution if it doesnt happen our democracy will continue to weaken and things will get worse right now we have a two party electoral dictatorship with each party looking for the highest corporate bidder

6630051 laws control the lesser man right conduct controls the greater one
6630052 one of the greatest delusions in the world is the hope that the evils in this world are to be cured by legislation
6630053 naturally the common people dont want war neither in russia nor in england nor in america nor in germany that is understood but after all it is the leaders of the country who determine policy and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along whether it is a democracy or a fascist dictatorship or a parliament or a communist dictatorship voice or no voice the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders that is easy all you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger it works the same in any country
6630054 preventive war was an invention of hitler frankly i would not even listen to anyone seriously that came and talked about such a thing
6630055 the purpose of the law is not to prevent a future offense but to punish the one actually committed
6630056 ultimately we need to restore the understanding that in a democracy the rights of citizens to govern themselves are more important than the rights of corporations to make money
6630057 it does not require a majority to prevail but rather an irate tireless minority keen to set brush fires in peoples minds

6630060 america will never be destroyed from the outside if we falter and lose our freedoms it will be because we destroyed ourselves

6630073 facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored
6630074 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
6630075 banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin the bankers own the earth take it away from them but leave them the power to create money and with the flick of the pen they will create enough deposits to buy it back again however take it away from them and all the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear for this would be a happier and better world to live in but if you wish to remain the slaves of bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery let them continue to create money and control credit
6630076 it was not accidental it was a carefully contrived occurrence the international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all

6630097 embrace the potential of internet enabled government transparency by reducing the federal role in presenting important government information to citizens
6630098 today government bodies consider their own websites to be a higher priority than technical infrastructures that open up their data for others to use we argue that this understanding is a mistake it would be preferable for government to understand providing reusable data rather than providing websites as the core of its online publishing responsibility rather than struggling as it currently does to design sites that meet each end user need we argue that the executive branch should focus on creating a simple reliable and publicly accessible infrastructure that exposes the underlying data private actors either nonprofit or commercial are better suited to deliver government information to citizens and can constantly create and reshape the tools individuals use to find and leverage public data the best way to ensure that the government allows private parties to compete on equal terms in the provision of government data is to require that federal websites themselves use the same open systems for accessing the underlying data as they make available to the public at large
6630099 a government data provider can provide a digital signature alongside each data item a third party site that presents the data can offer a copy of the signature along with the data allowing the user to verify the authenticity of the data item by verifying the digital signature without needing to visit the government site directly

6630119 they were found by a specialist volunteer who helps us clean the statuary in cliveden
6630120 he went to a talk at the local archaeological society given by a snail specialist mentioned his find and it turned out hed spotted the colony which had almost certainly been there since 1896

6630123 what theyre doing what theyre eating we dont rightly know although its likely theyre feeding on lichen or algae growing on the marble
6630124 but whats important is theyve also been found in two possibly three other places at cliveden so all our eggs are not in one basket from a conservation point of view

6630131 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6630132 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county

6630144 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6630145 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6630146 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6630147 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6630148 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6630149 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6630150 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6630151 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6630152 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6630153 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6630154 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6630155 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6630156 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6630157 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6630158 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6630159 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6630160 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6630161 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6630162 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6630163 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6630164 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6630165 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6630166 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6630167 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6630168 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6630169 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6630170 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6630171 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6630172 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6630173 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion

6630175 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6630176 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6630177 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them

6630185 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6630186 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6630187 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6630188 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6630189 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6630190 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6630191 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6630192 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6630193 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6630194 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6630195 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6630196 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6630197 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6630198 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6630199 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
6630200 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6630201 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6630202 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6630203 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6630204 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6630205 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6630206 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6630207 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6630208 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely

6630217 the information held by the foreign secretary is not merely necessary but essential if binyam mohamed is to have his case fairly considered
6630218 we believe there will be information helping to corroborate binyan mohameds story
6630219 he says it was during this time that he was tortured and this will obviously affect his case

6630224 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6630225 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

6630286 i came into the league in 1985 and i knew him from a distance then
6630287 by the time the strike came in 1987 you could see how driven he was to advance our cause i just grew to have the utmost respect for what hes been able to do ever since
6630288 i think his legacy will be that of one of the very few people who had a very significant impact on the national football league
6630289 he had an impact as a player and as a union leader and as good as he was as a player his impact as a union leader far outweighs that he benefited thousands of people past present and future players
6630290 but no one could ultimately question from a big picture standpoint the job he has done the job he was doing and the job he would have done
6630291 its gonna take a lot more than that my friend

6630294 and i thought it had to be a hoax because it was all of a sudden i tried to search online and it was true it was very sad to hear
6630295 the national football league is deeply saddened by the loss of gene upshaw
6630296 it is a shock to most of us not even knowing that he was ill he is a hall of famer he has been in the position of leadership for the players association for 25 years he is a guy that has earned his stripes so to speak and it was very very difficult to learn this and not even know there was anything wrong
6630297 he was the man who started it and got it organized with a lot of help from other people his services to the league for five decades wont be questioned his services to the players wont be questioned
6630298 i think hell be remembered as a guy that had the best interest of the players and took a stand
6630299 weve come a long way as a union and as a league

6630352 most customers wont want rainforest destruction and climate change in every mouthful of cookies or crackers so our plan is to start with the most prominent brands once we get some of the top brands on our side well use the power of the pocketbook to convince the a b cs adm bunge and cargill that destroying rainforests and increasing climate change isnt smart for business or the planet

6630359 were not going into the ad network business so to speak
6630360 we look at how we enable the existing players to have a better digital advertising opportunity
6630361 the tailoring of content and media to individuals should apply to all aspects of advertising not just the bottom of the funnel
6630362 we operate in unit based media economy where everyone gets the same content and sees the same ad were moving to an impression based economy well provide the platform that will enable the industry to do that and as we introduce those sorts of services well charge for them

6630367 im looking forward to talking with leadership the governor lt gov congress people leaders from around the country and maybe my colleagues on city councils maybe theyll give me a good idea or two
6630368 his theme is change this is what people have talked to me about the real need is to change the atmosphere in washington as well as the leadership in washington i think we need someone like sen obama who can do both of those things
6630369 its hard to create energy people have other things to do they have busy lives they are worried about the economy and getting their kids to soccer practice i expect they will focus on it the campaign a lot more over the next 60 days because it is important
6630370 i always look forward to being around my fellow democrats it is very energizing
6630371 cnn wanted to come to my house in greenville i said no thanks after the ohio primary it finally settled down
6630372 i hope he comes out of the convention with a unified and energized democratic party that is my profound hope and i think this will occur
6630373 opening it up to that many more people not just the delegates but also to ordinary people is a great idea
6630374 jumping diving can cause serious bodily injury or death for your safety please stay off rock
6630375 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have
6630376 so they asked his staff and he said at least four
6630377 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6630378 neither obama nor mccain owns the economy as an issue because theyve never focused on it really in ways that working class families would identify with
6630379 obama has always been about hope and change in a broad sense while mccain has always been about foreign policy and experience
6630380 a lot of items in the plant including critical components
6630381 i wouldnt want to live within 5 or 10 miles of the place
6630382 i think the option we would have if we were not given the six months there is a really high likelihood that we would no bid the program
6630383 theres definitely more kids that come to the gym and it is really nice to little girls saying they want to go to the olympics just from watching it
6630384 for every gymnast out there its their dream to go to the olympics so just seeing them and seeing that they have the ability to be there and get that far its just really amazing
6630385 i thought wow maybe i could be there in eight years
6630386 it inspires me personally because i just think about the hard work and the dedication and the trials and the setbacks those kids and their coaches have gone through and it makes me want to come into the gym and inspire kids so that they can enjoy going to gymnastics enough to pursue something as big as an olympic dream
6630387 irradiation is effective in reducing levels of potentially dangerous pathogens such as salmonella and e coli and will provide an additional tool that may be helpful to protect the public from microbial hazards
6630388 this final rule will permit the irradiation of fresh iceberg lettuce and fresh spinach to a maximum absorbed dose of 4 0 kgy kilogray which is effective in reducing microbial pathogens that have been associated with these crops in the past
6630389 this isnt going to eliminate the need to wash the product the fda continues to recommend that consumers thoroughly wash produce uinder running water before they eat it
6630390 pre washed bagged produce can be used without further washing
6630391 this is not to take the place of other controls its an additional pathogen reduction method
6630392 this is truly an international solution for an international city that enhances the gold coasts reputation as a tourism and lifestyle destination
6630393 the project has moved a step closer to construction and delivering a public transport solution that the gold coast deserves
6630394 first and foremost we are looking to the gold coast city council delivering on its strong support to date
6630395 our partners the city councillors have already had the opportunity to view the preliminary business case and this enables council to make an informed decision on the project
6630396 what this means is we will start discussions with private sector construction companies to determine their willingness to partner with the state government and gold coast city council on the project
6630397 up until now the private sector could not realistically begin planning their bids but with the certainty of the business case these companies can now get to work designing their bids
6630398 the gold coast is a beautiful city and we want to keep it that way
6630399 the community can help us with having a say on traffic parking and the locations of stations
6630400 traffic on the citys main roads is estimated to be increasing by an average of 4 3 per cent each year
6630401 currently only 4 per cent or 65 000 trips are made by the coast community on public transport and with rapid transit it is projected to grow to 10 per cent by 2026
6630402 by making public transport faster more efficient and more reliable this project is estimated to take up to 40 000 car trips off the roads that will have a significant effect on future congestion and avoiding gridlock
6630403 the rapid transit project is a key element of the queensland governments plan to address congestion on the coast
6630404 it is just one part of a larger integrated approach we are bringing to the gold coast
6630405 its clear the findings have some wider implications for anzs management of other non traditional businesses particularly in our institutional division
6630406 this includes formal notes placed on employment records cuts to remuneration and the departure from anz of six managers and executives
6630407 i recognise the legacy of anzs involvement in equity finance may well be with the group for some time through legal claims that we will continue to defend and the impact of these issues to our reputation
6630408 there have been no winners from this unfortunate series of events
6630409 the collapse of brokers has had a significant affect on the lives of their clients and their families together with those of the affected staff members at anz
6630410 we cant expect to win so many games if you concede three goals and two
6630411 there is definitely some defensive aspects we need to look at weve played quite a lot and were a little bit tired today which was a bit of concern
6630412 this doesnt stop me from playing but i am constantly hurting
6630413 im used to playing while im injured so this wont stop me
6630414 the last thing we want is that the whale should suffer
6630415 the vets are saying he hasnt got long to go you should take action
6630416 the animal is suffering shark inflicted injuries is experiencing breathing difficulties and its flukes are hanging down
6630417 some people are very upset and some were very aggressive its a bit harrowing personally
6630418 theyve been calling me the worst names you can imagine including effing murderer which is a bit hard to take ive spent my life working with animals
6630419 but its understandable because theres a lot of community concern it says something about our attitude to the environment
6630420 finally he explained that this kind of unbridled enthusiasm without any intelligence behind it just doesnt exist in england theres no equivalent
6630421 our results show that hot flushes night sweats sleeplessness and joint pains were less common in women on hrt in this age group sexuality was also improved
6630422 even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains
6630423 while this study shows some short term benefits it did not show overall improvements in overall quality of life or depression
6630424 both have come through the week and done well so theyll only get better with another outing
6630425 rocky is an influential inspirational player because he does intimidate and blokes alongside him tend to respond to that
6630426 its good to have him back and he certainly didnt enjoy watching the last outing the loss to the all blacks in auckland hopefully he will bring some of that grumpiness with him
6630427 its not a reflection of ranking and the volume of game time for the two players will not change
6630428 it is just the order we will be using this week and well be looking for matt to put the afterburners on al has performed really well this year and we know he is capable of going the distance matt doesnt have the same volume of game time under his belt but he will be an asset as it will be dry and it is going to be fast
6630429 i really dont try to think too much about footy because there is a trap in over complicating things
6630430 it is just a game after all you just go out there and do what you have to do at the best of your ability and thats all ive been trying to do
6630431 every player has a disappointment in their career and not going to the world cup last year was mine
6630432 i then wasnt happy with my form in the arc australian rugby championship and so i thought to myself its now or never i decided it was time for me to really step up
6630433 i tended to have brain snaps where i did something stupid which at the time i thought was a good idea but when you look back you realise it wasnt
6630434 thats something ive worked pretty hard on to eradicate i began telling myself if it seems stupid at the time its probably not a good idea to do it
6630435 global economic factors are starting to affect australias car industry
6630436 we expect there to be a notable softening in new car sales for the rest of the year and were taking these actions to strategically position our business to match our production to market demand
6630437 what weve seen in recent times is that the price of the australian sedans has increased by about au8 500 as a result of currency movements whereas the tariff is worth about 600
6630438 its quite clear that there are much larger issues at stake here than the tariff
6630439 while there is understandable caution among retailers the world over we remain confident that our multi brand multi region business model will deliver healthy growth and our forward orders support this view
6630440 a very pleasing result in any climate let alone in the prevailing economic conditions
6630441 this again demonstrates the resilience of our business model and the heightened global demand for the groups brands

6630446 i think if you are just talking about income how about 5 million
6630447 it really disturbs me right now with all the people on silver spring leaving
6630448 if we play our cards right we can easily piggyback off of bayshore
6630449 if we stand idly by and fail to improve our business district
6630450 could be a real cool eclectic complement to the more mainstream retail in bayshore

6630454 that would usually be sufficient to exchange fluid and qualify as sex
6630455 yes sir because they increase their chance of transmitting an infection such as hiv
6630456 its justifying its current gay blood ban policy using some of the grossest and most offensive myths and stereotypes around
6630457 many of the samples in studies cited by the red cross are very small recruited from men at high risk and explicitly exclude men who practise safe sex in monogamous relationships they are not representative of all men who have sex with men
6630458 when you ask australians a straightforward honest question youre likely to get a straightforward honest answer
6630459 i think were talking about a one in 100 risk of death on the one hand with using old blood and about a one in a million risk of hiv on the other much rarer than getting struck by lightning
6630460 so many hetro sic men cheat on their wives girlfriends etc
6630461 the type of information collected allows us to see what type of behaviour men are engaging in to see what their sexual social and drug taking practices are like which is important for an organisation like acon so we can be aware of any trends that are developing and tell if messages of safe sex are getting through
6630462 the recruiters tend to go to the same venues each time so were likely to get a similar group of people each time it makes it an effective way to track behaviour and is also really useful for acon to tell if their advertising campaigns are working properly or if they need to modify their tactics
6630463 its a really worthwhile exercise not that ive had any negative experiences in the past but people really shouldnt be scared if they get approached to fill out a survey it only takes 10 minutes and is totally confidential
6630464 there were large numbers of police in the area on friday and saturday night which is a good thing but were still concerned
6630465 the court judgment is vindication of the citys commitment to balancing the needs of residents and the night time economy of our city
6630466 it reaffirms that late trading hours are a privilege for those premises that have shown ongoing good management practices and not a right
6630467 until the management of this hotel show an ongoing level of compliance over a reasonable period of time then i would respectfully submit that the development consent trading hours are reviewed and strong consideration be made for the trading hours to be reverted to standard trading hours for hotels
6630468 please do not stress everyone operations will continue exactly as per usual same security guards same bar staff even same door girl

6630481 i would not have nominated uhhh clarence thomas uh i dont think that uhhh i i i i i i dont think that he was an exper uh a strong enough jurist or legal thinker uh at the time uh for that elevation setting aside the fact that i profoundly disagree with his interpretations of a lot of the constitution
6630482 it should be in every rucksack for those times when soldiers need spiritual energy
6630483 in the process of securing comments for recommending the book i believe there was a basic misunderstanding on my part that the comments were publishable
6630484 this is an opportunity to discuss issues with the irb face to face
6630485 there are a number of technical matters wed like to raise but there are two issues we want to straighten out
6630486 wed like to discuss our request to meet referees in the company of opposition coaches before test matches and correct the suggestions that we have failed in our duties to provide refereeing reports to the irb
6630487 we have enormous sympathy for referees who in some cases have had to manage blowing as many as five different sets of laws this season
6630488 its only natural that wed want to talk to them about interpretations in such a complex environment
6630489 it travelling will always favour them australia and new zealand
6630490 they gain a day but we lose a day when we fly there then you also have to play for financial reasons on consecutive saturdays
6630491 we know we need to win both games with bonus points but again we wont be throwing the ball around all over in the game
6630492 i ignored them and if i saw a white cane i would go the other way
6630493 i read a book one night and the next morning i couldnt read the paper it happened that quickly its a shocking trauma
6630494 i thought why did this happen to me and what will i do next there was a lot of sadness loneliness and self pity
6630495 then i decided i couldnt do that you have to look after yourself first and then you can help others so i got feisty and got out
6630496 its become a major issue locally but its also the top insect pest in canada for dry beans potatoes carrots and rutabagas the worst case scenario is complete loss and crops that are unmarketable
6630497 they are unfussy eaters and are attracted to the carbon dioxide emitted by any growing vegetation in the soil
6630498 insecticides once silenced the wireworm but the removal of many pesticides from the market has left crops vulnerable to wireworm attack
6630499 in the spring set traps to see if you have wireworms
6630500 put some sliced carrots in the ground leave them for a week and then see if the pests have attached themselves to the carrots or left holes in them

6630505 its a driver distraction simulator which we use to show people how driving while distracted is really dangerous we want people to realize that when they are driving thats all they should be doing
6630506 you get to have the accident you normally wouldnt walk away from
6630507 so you have some change in your cup holder a very convenient place why dont you find about 1 30 for your morning coffee
6630508 might be a good idea to stay on your own side of the road do you always go 70 in a 50 zone
6630509 driver distraction is estimated to be a contributing factor in eight out of every 10 police reported crashes
6630510 i guess you could say that i went into this super 14 season wanting to play my best for the reds and hopefully that would continue and week by week i would try to make the wallabies team or the 22
6630511 when i first got called up it was a pleasing surprise and each week has just been an added bonus to me but each week im going to make the most of my opportunities
6630512 now im here i definitely dont want to give it up
6630513 missing out on the world cup squad was something i took not hard but it was a big disappointment
6630514 everyone who plays rugby has a disappointment in their career they dont make a team they dont make a squad
6630515 robbie and the new coaching staff arent bringing any baggage into the team environment its a clean slate and its been good for the guys
6630516 that is the sort of environment we live in its pretty cut throat its a very big wrap for me
6630517 im certainly not an art historian but a mural in that style in this area more than one of us were thinking that independently it might have been wishful thinking
6630518 the name of the artist wasnt seen at first because dust and cobwebs were covering it up
6630519 what ive seen of the mural has been by bending back the pegboard and peering at it from an acute angle with not great lighting
6630520 we were all psyched for antiques roadshow to come by

6630527 last year i found i was really timid i didnt really put a lot of hits on guys but i took a lot this year now that i know what it feels like to get hit and hit some other cars ill be less timid
6630528 i feel good but im a little nervous there is always a little bit of a danger element to this kind of stuff but it doesnt really cross into your mind a whole lot and i think doing this last year really helps because i know a little bit of what to expect
6630529 it feels awesome its about time ive been doing the derby a long time
6630530 there were a lot of people who were taught lessons on that over the years
6630531 probably a third of our funds raised over the labour day weekend come from the auction and yard sale
6630532 labour day is definitely a huge commitment for the fire department
6630533 its the biggest fundraiser of the year and it also gives the firefighters a chance to meet with a lot of people in the community

6630538 the industry has taken much greater strides than anyone ever imagined 40 years ago
6630539 there is speculation that we may be approaching an inflection point where the rate of technology advancements is accelerating at an exponential rate and machines could even overtake humans in their ability to reason in the not so distant future
6630540 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6630541 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6630542 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6630543 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6630544 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable
6630545 as were approaching the scene were seeing cars that are slowing down and stopped you can see the brake lights
6630546 from the time the vehicle starts that turn until the time of impact is less than a second
6630547 you think about the impact you saw in the video youd think itd be a lot worse but these siren speakers absorb a lot of the energy
6630548 another ambulance came for her transported her to a hospital and then the call we were originally responding to another ambulance came in for that call as well
6630549 unfortunately these accidents do occur and its troublesome for us
6630550 its always a bad deal when were involved in an accident because someone is hurt were also then not responding to the scene of the emergency we were going to in the first place
6630551 thats good that theyre starting before the playoffs that way they can get some practice at it and it will run a little bit smoother once the playoffs start
6630552 there are so many parks where there are poles behind the fence that you cant see and it bounces around it just makes it tough for the umpires
6630553 i think they would rather get the call right especially in a playoff or world series atmosphere
6630554 its easier on the umpires and its better for the game
6630555 i guess its all going to depend if it works in your favor or not
6630556 i personally dont like it just for the fact you start bringing computers into the game
6630557 theres human error involved in both sides from players side to an umpires side nobodys perfect
6630558 i still think there are going to be some plays that are questionable and replays not going to help much on those
6630559 but itll be good get it right and move on
6630560 weve moved him around a lot hes got that talent where you can do that with him but around second base he has really played well hes playing good baseball for us
6630561 ras proteins exist in all cells anchored to the inside of the cell membrane where they regulate cell growth and cell division the enzyme we are studying helps ras proteins get anchored to the cell membrane by blocking this enzyme we were able to inhibit the binding of ras proteins to cell membranes and greatly improve the disease symptoms in mice with blood cancer
6630562 when we inhibited the production of the enzyme the development of blood cancer declined and the uncontrolled growth of bone marrow cells was blocked another discovery was that normal bone marrow cells were not significantly affected by the icmt enzyme the means that future drugs for inhibiting icmt could specifically target the pathogenic cells and leave normal cells intact a drub that blocks this enzyme could be an effective future cancer treatment
6630563 what we have here is a completely novel approach to combating illness
6630564 the sensors in bacteria are waiting for the right signal to initiate the expression of virulent genes
6630565 using led209 we blocked those sensing mechanisms and basically tricked the bacteria to not recognize that they were within the host when we did that the bacterial pathogens could not effectively cause disease in the treated animals
6630566 what makes this current study unique is that we showed the drug working in three different pathogens
6630567 only a few new antibiotics have reached the market in recent years
6630568 because led209 has never been used as an antibiotic its a completely different type of drug in addition its target qsec is also different from the current antimicrobial drug targets this study demonstrates that led209 has promise in fighting at least three pathogens and likely many more
6630569 what we have right now works really well for systemic infections and its very potent but we also need non absorbable molecules to treat noninvasive pathogens such as ehec which stays in the intestine
6630570 one of the areas that we are particularly interested in is the connection between disruption of normal sleep patterns and its impact on bipolar disorder in relation to progression and treatment of the disorder
6630571 when you are going through tough economic times which our state and our country are right now you have to have concern over perceptions
6630572 but what im hearing is a really exciting opportunity for this university
6630573 in terms of how this would be financed its like a commercial real estate project its like vine center or centrepointe
6630574 its the same concept they used to finance a cricket stadium in india and two premier soccer stadiums in brazil
6630575 its the first time theyve tried it with an american college
6630576 but i have to live in lexington so i have a lot riding on this
6630577 this is the most exciting project ill work on in my career im very optimistic
6630578 the best arena in the world university of kentucky basketball coach billy gillispie welcomes the possibility of a new home arena
6630579 youre not going to go backward you see if you can improve upon the fantastic facilities you already have
6630580 itd be good for kentucky baseball because a new stadium is commitment
6630581 i think we play in the best arena in the world right now
6630582 but when you get a chance to look into the possibility of even improving on something of that nature thats pretty exciting
6630583 i dont think its proper for basketball coaches to do anything but support the leadership of the city and the school and the administration of the school
6630584 no question were going to have in the near future a new facility
6630585 our facility has been plenty good for us to be successful here
6630586 but there are a number of new facilities and new changes in the conference and we have to keep up
6630587 thats the nature of what we do and the nature of the sec southeastern conference
6630588 i feel like ive got to lead and help these guys with the situations were going to be in
6630589 im bringing the experience to the table and helping these guys to see what to do and how to do it
6630590 hes a guy that came from a very humble difficult background and struggled early on getting adjusted to college life
6630591 but hes flourished since then and worked his way through injuries without getting down and hanging his head hes just been a very positive individual on our football team
6630592 coach brooks is both a coach and a close personal friend to me
6630593 my freshman year when i got in academic trouble he talked to me and encouraged me to do better i sit by him on the way to games if we go to the movies we sit next to each other and chat were pretty close
6630594 i know im going to get my chances this year and im going to make the most out of them

6630599 longplayer chooses and combines these sections in such a way that no combination is repeated until exactly one thousand years has passed at this point the composition arrives back at the point at which it first started in effect longplayer is an infinite piece of music repeating every thousand years a millennial loop
6630600 how does one keep a piece of music playing across generations how does one prepare for its technological adaptability knowing how few technologies have remained viable over the last millenium how does one legislate for its upkeep and how can one communicate that responsibility to those who might be looking after it some 950 years after its original custodians have perished

6630612 israeli policies are designed to limit the number of palestinians living in areas earmarked for settlements or in their vicinity
6630613 the israeli authorities have for many years applied a discriminatory policy of house demolitions permitting on the one hand many tens of israeli settlements to be built on occupied palestinian territory in flagrant violation of international law at the same time as they confiscate palestinian lands forbidding the palestinian population to build and destroying their houses the cleared land is often used to build illegal israeli settlements international law prohibits occupying powers from building settlements for their own citizens on the territories they occupy

6630651 youll probably say im one of the guys causing part of the problem
6630652 well then if there is no silver shortage if thats what you are telling me then i should sell out all of my 100 oz silver bars at the current high premiums and then buy another form of silver at spot with the money right
6630653 problem is what kind of silver would you then get
6630654 i used to take 100 oz bars and melt them down into silver shot and so you are saying that i should not do that anymore
6630655 refiners could get squeezed because they are not going to get silver from the coin shops as much anymore if at all
6630656 not really because we are making more money in gold refining now

6630665 mrs gotbaums death while tragic does not warrant criminal charges against police officers who were simply trying to carry out their duties they committed no crime
6630666 from what we know at this stage they may have been grossly negligent in how they treated her but they certainly were not acting criminally
6630667 despite the global downturn flattening the growth of personal debt and uk gdp over the past few quarters debt levels continue to grow at a faster rate than the income the uk generates
6630668 although there is no cause for panic as personal debt is well covered by the uk housing stock the figures clearly illustrate the continuing problem of growing personal debt levels in the uk

6630670 combined hrt improves sleep aches and pains and sexual functioning these gains can now be factored in to a womans choice to use combined hrt
6630671 this benefit must be weighed against the overall short and long term risks which must be individualised for women based on years since menopause medical history and chosen regimen further research with appropriate measures is needed to assess more fully the impact of combined hrt on all aspects of health related quality of life for postmenopausal women
6630672 the increased risk of serious diseases including breast cancer coronary heart disease and blood clots with the use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy is now well established
6630673 we are working hard to avert a strike and to conclude the current pay discussions however we have full contingency arrangements in place to ensure that the usual high standard of security is maintained with minimal disruption for passengers
6630674 yarls wood is to be congratulated on sustaining reasonable performance in many areas despite the upheavals of the change of management and reduction in staff numbers however significant concerns remain particularly the lack of activity for detainees which is a failure that we have identified across the immigration detainee estate even more worrying was the plight of children detained for increasing periods of time and with insufficient provision to meet their needs yarls wood must seek to meet these concerns but they are ultimately issues for the uk border agency which must urgently address them
6630675 were determined to treat children within our immigration system with fairness and compassion thats why the majority stay in detention for a week or less
6630676 often children are only detained when their parents try to frustrate the removal process detention then becomes necessary to maintain a robust but fair asylum system those with no right to be in the uk must return home and last year we removed a person every eight minutes
6630677 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him

6630680 fight the evils of abortion contraception sex education and family breakdown
6630681 the next magazine a weekly publication from hong kong reported that infant corpses and fetuses have become the newest supplements for health and beauty in china not only is the placenta considered a beauty remedy but also aborted fetuses are much sought after delicacies in guangdong gourmet body parts are in high demand and can even be purchased through hospitals
6630682 a ccording to wikipedia the epoch times is an anti chinese government newspaper wikipedia compares the next magazine from whence epoch got its information to a sensationalist type paper that said wikipedia is accessible by all to skew including the chinese government and there are good sensationalist news organizations like drudge and even the enquirer these days and bad sensationalist rags that boast alien abductions on their front page but ive read legitimate news stories of the chinese doing strange things with embryos so i think this stuff is happening and that last photo in particular looks real
6630683 teachers certainly see abused kids hungry kids neglected kids poor kids so the neas logic is to help kill these problem kids before theyre born thats the same logic of many pro aborts both self serving and lazy
6630684 platform as first lady was illiteracy so she obviously thought abortion was a solution to illiteracy in actuality then she was a eugenicist because it is poor people who are illiterate not rich people
6630685 you would think shed focus on her behavior that caused her to contract that sexually transmitted disease
6630686 whether it was her husband who passed hpv on to her after sleeping with other women
6630687 if halvorson contracted hpv through rape in which case she could discuss ways to avoid rape
6630688 we had a great turnout and it was nice to be able to let the kids run around on our game field
6630689 they had a great time and i think our players enjoyed it just as much
6630690 hopefully the kids learned some things as they begin their football careers and head into their junior high seasons
6630691 we need a plan for breaking up fannie and freddie and selling them to private investors so that the government isnt the biggest backer of the housing market
6630692 the government better get a heck of a good guy to run fannie and freddie
6630693 for all practical purposes fannie and freddie are nationalized but the government doesnt have enough control given its interest in the housing market
6630694 this process needs to be done in an overt rather than covert fashion so that market participants know what the rules are
6630695 if the government wants to provide a subsidy why not just give it directly to borrowers and get dollar for dollar on its money
6630696 of course the problem is that this would be a government program but its more efficient than the system we have now
6630697 this is when the market could effectively shut them down
6630698 it could cause total panic in the global financial system which is based on credit
6630699 some people say let them fail and let the market sort it out and the market will sort it out
6630700 but in the meantime that could mean the end of the market and the financial institutions and banks they tried that during the great depression the market will work but its a question of cost and the cost would be the collapse of the banking system
6630701 fannie and freddie are private institutions that had special privileges in the marketplace which forced competitors out of business
6630702 my experience in government says whenever possible the government shouldnt run it
6630703 but this is one of those times when the government has to run it
6630704 i am trying to act nonchalant but on my signal lets you and me get out of here before these two go apeshit and wipe the floor with me
6630705 deepa hit me and seema bit me deepa hit me and seema bit me
6630706 it was like a siren a rhyming siren a siren poem
6630707 abdul bashar frequented syed yar jung colony during his stay in the city so we called in hussain to know about the formers activities and the people whom he used to meet
6630708 if the doctor is declared hostile it will have an adverse impact on his career if he goes to other court for statement he might be insulted by citing a copy of this statement as per the evidence act his case is the one of corroborating evidence and hence he cant be declared hostile
6630709 when various leads and interrogations lead nowhere we decided to go back to meticulous and tedious detective work the first thing we did was to collect qayamuddins phone records since january 1 2008
6630710 the suspect has an excellent academic record he scored 82 per cent in ssc opted for science stream and then again went to score 80 45 per cent in hsc his gujcet score was 104 out of 119 on the basis of this result he easily got an mbbs seat in waghodia his first year result is first class with impressive marks
6630711 it is possible that someone might have sent the mail by hacking into our wi fi system the police officials have been visiting our institute regularly
6630712 they then suspected the students involvement he is a firm believer and used to do the namaaz regularly he even shocked some of his professors when he went out of the class to attend religious discourses we hope that he comes clean on the issue
6630713 we cant play with a doctors career if we get enough evidences against him we will name him and even present him to media at the moment we cant say anything about the issue
6630714 no person has been detained from the institute the officials have questioned around 60 students to know who was using the computer on july 31 afternoon between 2 to 3 30 pm when the mail was generated we are supporting police in the fight against terror
6630715 raza has been actively seeking legal help to release nagori and his associates he has been previously arrested several times for simi related activities we have information that he was working at reorganising simi after the arrest of its top brass chaudhary said
6630716 it took me a while to let things go you just have to work through that stuff it takes a few years divorce is really awful a lot of people go through that more than once and i dont know how they do it i mean once was enough for me
6630717 were in this time when you have to be young and pretty weve gone back to that
6630718 there were a lot of people 10 or 15 years ago who were putting on funny clothes and playing some kind of country music who were dabbling
6630719 blue mountain was really authentic they were blending country blues and rock in an interesting way that only two or three bands were doing
6630720 it was one of the most happening places culturally in the country
6630721 fat possum records was based there so you had r l burnside and junior kimbrough and all those guys and oxford had this literary scene with larry brown and barry hannah there was a lot going on and we were kind of musically in the center of it
6630722 theres probably going to be periods of time where im probably not going to be making enough money from music and ill have to get an additional job
6630723 i mean thats how things have changed before we sold enough records and we made enough money on the road where we could really not worry about that for a while live show attendance has been up and down for everybody not just for us weve been lucky because we still have the markets where we did really well and were still doing really well but that could go away too
6630724 were going to introduce psp 3000 in october and this will be sold initially as part of a bundle with a piece of software during this period psp 2000 will remain as the base psp model
6630725 she started off from house soon after her lunch at 11 when we did not find her around 12 15 pm we went out to check where she was however i was then informed by some neighbours that my daughter had got electrocuted by a livewire she was later shifted to civil hospital by emergency medical services
6630726 the shopkeeper mewalal keeps a wire in his shop to save the shop from attacks of drunkards unaware of this dahyi went near it to pick an empty pouch
6630727 the debt is selling right now because the bond market thinks the government is going to step in and take over
6630728 if the treasury continues to hold their breath debt spreads will widen back up
6630729 i do not think it government intervention is going to happen this weekend i do not know if it is going happen within the next couple of weeks
6630730 the more the stocks trade down the higher the probability they will have to act i do not think 3 is that trigger point but it is certainly getting there
6630731 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time
6630732 if that does not turn out well then the treasury if they have not already done so will at that point be forced to step in and act more quickly than they would have
6630733 nobody is going to put equity capital or preferred stock into fannie and freddie with whats the government going to do hanging over your head
6630734 if the government were to provide support that didnt wipe out shareholders you will have another year of bad quarters and it then starts getting better so theres a lot of upside potential
6630735 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6630736 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6630737 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6630738 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6630739 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6630740 may have left us less able to connect the dots than we were before
6630741 if actually deployed will leave our country more vulnerable than the existing yet flawed system today
6630742 george bushs record as a student military man businessman and leader of the free world is one of constant failure and the part that troubles me most is he seems content with himself he will leave office with the country 10 trillion in debt fighting two wars our international reputation in shambles our government cloaked in secrecy and suspicion that his entire presidency has been a litany of broken laws and promises our citizens faith in our own country ripped to shreds yet bush goes bumbling along grinning and spewing moronic one liners as though nobody understands what a colossal failure he has been i fear to the depth of my being that john mccain is just like him
6630743 these phones are not designed for the humidity of panama
6630744 she could have done that any time by pushing three buttons
6630745 from what we know at this stage they may have been grossly negligent in how they treated her but they certainly were not acting criminally
6630746 it is important to have rules but most important to follow the rules to make the children feel safe give them all your love and teach them to love life i love children and i take responsibility for them i want to be a good role model for them after finishing secondary school i have worked as a substitute in a daycare and school and as a swim teacher i have always had a lot of children around me neighbors cousins sister and friends siblings i often visit my cousins three girls ages newborn 5 and 9 years old sometimes i babysit and sometimes i pick them up from school or drive them to tennis school i love the sea and have always lived close to it in my spare time i like to meet my friends paint swim dance snowboard or play the guitar
6630747 dear lynn it was a great pleasure to be worked on by robin and you yesterday and i cant thank you enough
6630748 i am a performing songwriter in the new york area
6630749 i havent been playing football that long and it had just become a new sport
6630750 i think i am raw in some aspects of it with the coaching up here but i feel like they can mold me
6630751 i feel like the skills are there and i just need a better understanding of the game and i need to refine that
6630752 i just wanted to be able to leave it all out there and do all i could do and i felt like i did that today
6630753 only yesterday in training did i start to feel confident with it
6630754 i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6630755 most teachers hold themselves accountable they didnt go into teaching to make money they dont have seven houses
6630756 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6630757 undermine the very thing youre trying to promote by getting them hooked on the rewards
6630758 there are essentially two ways of looking at combat the romantic and the realist
6630759 why not its late and if we argue theyll do it anyway
6630760 oh no how could that be i just put money on that card i have to call the bank
6630761 no that cant be youre computers must be down or something
6630762 i need to goto the car and get some cash the bank must be acting up
6630763 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6630764 he had no idea until sunday he had any problem nor did we or anyone else
6630765 his family and i were the only ones who knew gene had a very aggressive form of pancreatic cancer
6630766 i think gene is one of the most pivotal people in the history of the nfl
6630767 players past and present had no better friend than gene upshaw with time people will come to fully understand and appreciate his contributions and his legacy it was genes strength and conviction that got the players to where they are today
6630768 i would say no life is easily reduced to one issue and we had our issues and hes caused some suffering but theres still some humanity and our hearts and prayers go out to his family
6630769 upshaw was an easy target but the problem was bigger than him it is the institution itself and the commissioner he would be the pi ata and take the beating and make it seem that one man was taking the shots but the problem is more than just him
6630770 a lot of people forget theres no such thing as unanimous support in any body you represent but from a results standpoint what more could you want the retired players some of them are getting four times what they would have gotten if gene hadnt been there the stuff about being too close to tagliabue id like to have anyone explain to me how the players havent been served by gene the owners just opted out of this labor deal because it was such a bad deal for them and such a good deal for the players

6630776 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales
6630777 it seems that other than necessary living expenses delaying the purchase of equipment sale of grain or the purchase of other items is the choice of the day
6630778 the general consensus is that we should have the best overall crop production in 30 years we received rain when it was needed
6630779 however we may see improvement in this index in the months ahead
6630780 over 44 percent of the bankers reported that consumers as a result of higher energy prices were encouraged to shop locally slightly less than 12 percent disagreed with this linkage

6630789 make all decision based on whatever promotes the health competence and adaptive flexibility of oneself and of all the larger system of which one is a part
6630790 we can not own the land we are part of the land
6630791 we belong to and are inseparable from our culture from one another from earth from gaia we are interdependent with all that is
6630792 people are interdependent social beings we do not and cannot live as the independent tiger or orangutan coming together only to mate briefly all child care and education provided by the mother
6630793 this has seemed obvious to me and probably it is obvious to most but it is such an important principle to base further observations on and logically it is often ignored in the present scheme of things so i think we should look at the reasons
6630794 next question is a male female unit capable of independence the answer is quite important to the issue of reproduction
6630795 i have never heard of this being done and i dont believe it can be done
6630796 it is interesting to note that walking on two legs has not been all that uncommon in the history of life but i can think of no other species that has attempted pregnancy on two legs
6630797 further problems are having very little backup for minor sprains or illness loneliness can be a big problem even for couples as most of us eventually crave other people in our lives
6630798 the genetic and archaeological evidence indicates that we split off from chimpanzees which are social creatures and that we stayed social
6630799 we are all here on earth to help others what i cant figure out is what the others are here for
6630800 lets do what we want to do and then simply talk about it in their language and ideas
6630801 since in their worldview they do not think what we are doing is possible they will think we are doing what they want us to be doing because we are talking their language we will be left alone to do exactly what we want to do right under their noses they will be happy and we will be happy without there being any need for confrontation soon they will discover that we are growing and they are not because they are stuck standing there watching us
6630802 how can we do this in a way which works fully for those in the enterprise and those in the community rather than for one more than the other
6630803 if these ideas are true what kind of an organization does it suggest
6630804 work is the means adopted for attaining a higher level of satisfaction for human aspirations and demonstrating collaboration with the other members of the community to promote the common good to ensure that it is contributed freely productively and in a manner that makes everyones collaboration viable the members shall respect its discipline namely a hierarchy
6630805 when humans are confronted with conflict their mind brains shift to a very primitive and highly reactive way of thinking called the
6630806 system of human organization that creates a conflict free environment for decision making and action implementation
6630807 this is a law of life and the more lavishingly we show kindness and concern the richer is our life in what manner we get back what we have given is of minor importance the only thing that life promises is that life pays back all its debts to us
6630808 its not who you are underneath but what you do that defines you

6630813 the number of houses is a bit trickier to determine since the ranch has at least four houses and a two story cabin on it

6630816 all the back and forth on the council didnt help
6630817 i was hoping that matters could have been resolved more quickly
6630818 weve still got a ways to go before theres a windmill up and running but were getting there
6630819 i cant for the life of me imagine why it would be turned down
6630820 there is a definite move toward renewables and if people want to do that we will facilitate these things
6630821 this type of violent attack on a defenceless young man is deplorable and must be discouraged
6630822 its condominiums where ill have them get to you he said before quitting the campaign trail for three days to strategise with top aides as both the candidates finalise their choice of running mate
6630823 now think about that i guess if you think being rich means youve got to make us5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising you might think the economy is fundamentally strong he said
6630824 but if youre like me and youve got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their house you might have a different perspective
6630825 so theres just a fundamental gap of understanding between john mccains world and what people are going through every single day here in america
6630826 we cant afford eight more years or four more years or one more year of the same failed economic policies that president george bush has put in place senator obama said
6630827 heres one house america cant afford to let john mccain move into
6630828 he couldnt count high enough to know how many houses he owns he said on cnn before introducing senator obama in chester by countering republican charges that the relatively inexperienced democrat is too
6630829 a matter of getting a bulldog grip on the faith and not
6630830 i am coming to think that god may he be praised in his great mystery loves and helps best those who are so beat and have so much nothing when they come to die that it is almost as if they had persevered in nothing but had gradually lost everything piece by piece until there was nothing left but god
6630831 every grade gets to go in the library and see all the leis on display
6630832 the giving of a lei is still a very very common practice here
6630833 my monthly rent will rise eight fold by august from the current 3 200 yuan to 25 600 yuan far beyond my budget
6630834 my landlord informed me about the new rent in march i had never imagined it would be that high
6630835 ive heard about the possibility of rents going through the roof during the games so i have tried to rent out my apartmenton a monthly basis so that its available in august
6630836 but they are going to take it to a birthday party a retirement party a baby luau if youre giving a luncheon and you have a special speaker theyre going to get a lei if you have government officials coming around theyre going to get leis
6630837 a carnation lei was considered the cr me de la cr me of leis
6630838 a person will worship something have no doubt about that we may think our tribute is paid in secret in the dark recesses of our hearts but it will out that which dominates our imaginations and our thoughts will determine our lives and our character therefore it behooves us to be careful what we worship for what we are worshipping we are becoming

6630859 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6630860 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6630861 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6630862 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6630863 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6630864 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6630865 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6630866 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6630867 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6630868 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6630869 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6630870 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6630871 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6630872 you can look at that body of work that he had when he played and hes in the hall of fame
6630873 you look at the body of work since hes played and its hall of fame material too

6630900 through your political and national security committee your parliament and ramadan falls early this year what will you do if you cant get this done by december 31st
6630901 the main sticking points in fact are also the most delicate setting a timeline for american troops to leave and declaring whether american forces would be granted immunity from iraqi prosecution
6630902 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6630903 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6630904 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6630905 a flying visit to baghdad by dr rice which drew a scathing reaction from the anti us cleric hojatoleslam moqtada al sadr he accused washington of trying to pressure the iraqi authorities to bend to its will
6630906 we advise the arab leaders that iraq should return to the arab group the return of iraq is an essential goal
6630907 saad hariri the leader of lebanons parliamentary majority visited iraq last month lebanon named an ambassador to iraq two years ago but he died and a replacement has not yet been chosen there is an iraqi embassy in beirut the capital of lebanon
6630908 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations
6630909 no chief executive likes to be in the position that i find myself today it is not anzs finest hour
6630910 the bottom line is we were in a business that we should never have entered into in the first place and it was in a business environment where the risks werent properly understood and werent properly managed
6630911 at the most basic level staff in the business didnt understand the reputational risks and the differences between managing a securities lending business and an equity finance business
6630912 we then compounded the problems by not having the usual risk controls and governance procedures in place
6630913 the review committee found that because of these failings these issues were never given the proper attention and oversight and in particular were not escalated to the ceo to the board committees or to the board in the way that they should have been
6630914 so this is what we found and it is clearly unacceptable
6630915 a number of employees have had formal notes placed on employment records and cuts to their remuneration eight managers and executives will leave anz this includes two members of the management board peter hodgson and david stephen

6630961 i started the site for a simple reason i felt ill served by the undemocratic gatekeeping mentality so prevalent in our society and at that time we seemed to be on an inexorable march toward war with no avenue for dissent there was an assumption by the powers that be that the rest of the citizen body couldnt think for ourselves that we needed self appointed and so called experts to tell us what to think what to do and what we should or should not know for far too long these gatekeepers controlled the national conversation

6630964 effective leaders draw people into their cause by creating powerful stories with clear distinctions between good and evil hero and villain instead of bemoaning the fact that americans love their entertainment culture political activists need to borrow hollywoods proven methods to structure gripping narratives and compelling communications strategies making politics and causes participatory exciting and fun is key to sustaining citizen involvement
6630965 target your villain craft your hero exploit their weaknesses reinforce the narrative aim for the gut not the brain own the story
6630966 when your enemies begin to notice you and attack you you have arrived instead of avoiding confrontation with gatekeepers and opponents embrace it and feed it stoking the flames of controversy brings visibility to your issues raises your profile and effectiveness and begins a cycle of ever increasing attention that you can use to your advantage

6630988 we really havent seen catch rates like these at buoy 10 since the late 1980s
6630989 we have to make sure we leave enough harvestable chinook for sport fisheries further upriver
6630990 data from coded wire tags indicates the concentration of upriver bright chinook in the catch is much higher than expected
6630991 thats significant because a portion of that stock is made up of federally protected chinook bound for the snake river and we need to minimize interception of those fish
6630992 if the buoy 10 fishery is any indication fishing should be great
6630993 with this rain weve been having we should see a lot more fish move into the river between now and then

6631014 we are here to integrate airpower into joint operations in iraq and ensuring we make the most of our unmanned aerial system capabilities is just one of many ways we do that
6631015 with our ability to provide persistent stare and persistent strike we provide a clear battlefield assessment and quick responses to commanders when they need it
6631016 this was a great example of the reapers unique capabilities
6631017 we searched for found fixed targeted and destroyed a target with just one aircraft

6631021 the speed at which the force management and development council leadership provided direction and the expectations for these important bodies is a testament that the air force is serious about deliberate development of our airmen and posturing them to meet the challenges we face today and missions we taken on tomorrow

6631041 i was going to the field for cutting grass for cattle when i saw a few persons dumping the fish on the bank of the river later many villagers reached the spot and some of them picked up a few ones for cooking
6631042 when i was told about the dead fish this morning i enquired with all members and everybody denied the charge it might be the handiwork of some traders outside the market they had perhaps failed to preserve them on account of yesterdays strike
6631043 as soon as i came to know about the incident i informed matigara police the preliminary report i have received says the fish were removed and no villager has consumed them

6631045 although fuel prices have eased over the past month they have not declined to levels that will sustain the current level of profitability and fuel and economic conditions continue to be uncertain
6631046 however assuming no further deterioration in economic conditions qantas expects its 2008 09 profit before tax to be broadly in line with analyst consensus forecasts
6631047 in recognition of this contribution the board has approved the awarding of 1 000 worth of shares and a cash bonus of 1 000 to all eligible staff
6631048 the rapid rise in fuel costs since december last year is unprecedented and the impact has been felt across the aviation industry and the world economy
6631049 we have reacted quickly and have already announced a number of steps to reduce costs adjust capacity and increase fares
6631050 regarding the loyalty business qantas is well advanced in its preparations for a partial australian ipo subject to market conditions
6631051 the result included revenue of 850 million primarily from the redemption of qantas frequent flyer points for flight and other awards
6631052 total costs for the period were 721 million with the majority of costs being the purchase of airline seats from qantas group airline businesses
6631053 we understand the level of scrutiny we are being subjected to at present
6631054 we will work through these issues and implement any changes that may be required but our commitment to safety should never be questioned
6631055 the chief executive officer of qantas mr geoff dixon said qantas fuel bill would increase by more than 2 billion in 2008 09 representing around 35 per cent of the companys total expenditure
6631056 the fact is that fuel prices are something we have no control over so we have to look harder at areas where we do have control
6631057 the net effect of foreign exchange rate movements on overall profit before tax was a favourable impact of 239 million
6631058 total fuel costs of 3 6 billion for the year were 265 million or 8 per cent higher than the previous year the underlying into plane fuel price was 34 per cent higher increasing costs by 1 049 million while increased flying added 142 million
6631059 hedging benefits were 554 million higher than the previous year before adverse hedge accounting ineffectiveness which increased costs by 59 million favourable foreign exchange rate movements reduced fuel costs by 431 million

6631109 things are set up as contraries that are not even in the same category listen to me the opposite of radical is superficial the opposite of liberal is stingy the opposite of conservative is destructive thus i will describe myself as a radical conservative liberal but certain of the tainted red fish will swear that there can be no such fish as that beware of those who use words to mean their opposites at the same time have pity on them for usually this trick is their only stock in trade but do not pity them overly it is your own death and your souls death that they work by their deception

6631151 mukherjee himself told the delegation that the party was not averse to the idea of creating smaller states he also emphasised that the demand for gorkhaland was within the framework of the indian constitution and could not be termed anti national
6631152 our demand is gorkhaland and that was the only issue we discussed today
6631153 the meeting with mukherjee and his statement on the partys stand on smaller states must be seen as a positive response towards getting gorkhaland listed in the talks agenda
6631154 the congress leader told us that the issue would be discussed seriously soon he said the party was considering the setting up of a second state reorganisation commission to look into the demands of the smaller states in the country

6631197 i know the record companies figure out their target audience is thirtysomething females so they get these guy singers in there thinking that will appeal to them but theres nobody left for these thirtysomething women to relate to the guys theyre just there to be eye candy

6631225 we had to go in twice because of the lightning and rain but came out refocused both times and were able to get some stuff done
6631226 i saw the attention span pick up a little entering texas a amp m preparations with the different looks we were able to give them off cards and the best guesses as to what we might see i was proud of our football team and real pleased with the focus tonight

6631236 russia needs to develop infrastructure ahead of increasing production removing the bottlenecks
6631237 you have roughly the amount of storage you need for a really good harvest
6631238 the government now has lots of money that is lying free

6631240 this will make a phenomenal difference if it does raise more than 100 000 it will be our largest single event ever
6631241 the hospice costs about 5 000 a day to run for adults and children
6631242 this will be a tremendous boost to us it will make a real difference to all the work we do to support not just our patients but their families when they need it and when they are at their most vulnerable
6631243 most of us have had someone in the hospice at some time i thought it was a really good way for the trust to do something for someone else
6631244 i would be happy on the one hand joining a club and a team like bologna
6631245 officially im in the last year of contract ive had preliminary talks and there has been interest from elsewhere
6631246 its way too early to talk about this being a viable product category
6631247 im not sure how much of a market there is for them particularly with subnotebooks like macbook air with larger keyboards and displays getting thinner and lighter and you can get some real work done on say an iphone or a nokia e series smart phone

6631250 beside satellite a300 and p300 notebook series toshiba also released on market redesigned satellite l series
6631251 weve been linked with quite a few but we have shown an interest in bullard indeed in quite a few other players
6631252 it is not true that ledesma wants to leave lazio simply he does not want to hear talk about the contract at this time because he is focusing on giving the maximum to the team
6631253 beckham plays not only for free kicks and set pieces but because he plays well
6631254 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6631255 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him
6631256 i can surprise you sometimes as i got one in whom you did not expect and there still might be one more player coming in
6631257 you know the position but i cannot tell you much more
6631258 but we are not in a desperate situation because we have song back from the olympics diaby does not look too far away and hopefully we can good news from tomas rosicky in the next two weeks
6631259 this italy side is still developing and we need to remember that the austrian league has already started
6631260 its true that we tend to do badly in august but we need to try and reverse this tendency
6631261 the clubs have not agreed in scotland it is not common that the clubs buy players for millions of euros apart from celtic and rangers
6631262 we never do the same exercises during training and so everything is more varied
6631263 i also think that we are more solid in defence and that is incredible when you remember that most of our defenders are injured
6631264 however we have always had a strong back line and we didnt concede much last year
6631265 as far as transfer speculation is concerned i know nothing about whether he is going to go or stay
6631266 as far as him as a person he is a great professional a tremendous player and for me last season he was probably one of the top three buys in the premier league
6631267 he is just the whole package good in the air he can hold the ball it was a great return for what blackburn paid
6631268 but when it comes to transfer money i dont even know if he is saleable what with myself and bentley already gone youd have to call john williams blackburn chairman and ask him that
6631269 it would be tough if three of us were to leave in one summer
6631270 hes a hard worker and came into the premier league with people thinking hed had a lot of injuries and might not play that much
6631271 but i think he missed two training seasons all year and worked his socks off
6631272 unfortunately it is with deep regret that i have decided to dedicate my time to fiorentina only after my latest exclusion from the squad
6631273 i have never been shown and trust or given any chance to show my ability for the france team
6631274 i respect every decision that has been made and i accept that i dont feature in the coachs plans but i want to close the door to any future selection
6631275 it was always my dream to play for the national side and i have always worked towards that but there just wasnt a chance for me
6631276 hes played under pressure and handled it well hes a good young player and he will be fine
6631277 as ive traveled around alaska you know i havent had that question asked to me by anyone but a newsperson
6631278 we know we know emphasis that youre innocent cause you said youre innocent
6631279 his stuttering needs to be evaluated by a speech pathologist who understands aging issues
6631280 re uh read uh the book america alone a lot of people com uh complain about that book uh but look uh hes a democraee uh uh look at uh the demographic concepts uh of that book
6631281 im delighted its been ongoing all summer and great to get it finally done and dusted
6631282 its been on and off all summer and ive been hearing bits and pieces throughout that time
6631283 its good finally to get everything signed and be able to concentrate on the football
6631284 you dont know whats going to happen and it took its toll
6631285 i thoroughly enjoyed my time here its a great club and im just glad to be a part of it again
6631286 i look forward to playing for the club for the next four years
6631287 theres a good group of players and good players coming in to add to the quality thats already here so hopefully a good season ahead
6631288 i had an eye on the games and was disappointed when the lads went out
6631289 in the short term well have to concentrate on the league thats the big one this year
6631290 its way too early to talk about this being a viable product category

6631293 for example a lot of kids use their parents notebooks but they are just too heavy to carry to school but at two pounds kids can easily put ultraportables in their backpacks
6631294 i dont want to speak about the team before my arrival
6631295 i am looking to build a team mentality passion and everything this is my problem

6631300 when obama and his wife michelle a hospital executive decided to move with their two young girls from their hyde park condominium they chose a spacious three story georgian revival home on a tree lined street in the kenwood neighborhood not far from the university of chicago the owner had listed the house nearly 100 years old with four fireplaces and a wine cellar and an adjacent lot as separate parcels
6631301 two years ago obama bought a mansion on the south side in the kenwood neighborhood from a doctor on the same day antoin tony rezkos wife rita rezko bought the vacant lot next door from the same seller the doctor had listed the properties for sale together he sold the house to obama for 300 000 below the asking price the doctor got his asking price on the lot from rezkos wife
6631302 as a state senator barack obama wrote letters to city and state officials supporting his political patron tony rezkos successful bid to get more than 14 million from taxpayers to build apartments for senior citizens
6631303 obamas letters written nearly nine years ago for the first time show the democratic presidential hopeful did a political favor for rezko a longtime friend campaign fund raiser and client of the law firm where obama worked who was indicted last fall on federal charges that accuse him of demanding kickbacks from companies seeking state business under gov blagojevich
6631304 the letters appear to contradict a statement last december from obama who told the chicago tribune that in all the years hes known rezko ive never done any favors for him

6631422 half of the children whose parents had difficulties in reading and writing found learning to read more challenging than children in the control group the atypical characteristics of these childrens linguistic development indicated the risk at a very early stage and we were also able to draw a clearer picture of the typical progression of a development that indicates reading and writing difficulties
6631423 acquiring the ability to read demands much more practice from these children than from their peers the automatisation of reading poses an additional challenge also a fluent ability to read is a prerequisite to be able to understand a demanding piece of text
6631424 a slow reader isnt able to grasp a given text as a whole and therefore has a hard time following the storyline this is why we should pay special attention not only to the accuracy of reading and writing but also to the comprehension of texts even with quite long sentences
6631425 and in a way that children find amusing even if they do have difficulties in learning to read
6631426 the best time to start these exercises is the latter part of the pre school age but its not too late even after the children have started school the learning result of course improves with repeated training more than once a day and in short sessions the optimal time for a single playing session is however long the children find it enjoyable

6631437 in the last couple of years their numbers have grown and we havent
6631438 the situation in the theatre has deteriorated over the summer and this is another reflection of that
6631439 afghan national police and canadian forces responded to the scene and medical evacuation was requested
6631440 all four soldiers were evacuated to kandahar air field sadly three of the soldiers were confirmed dead by medical authorities
6631441 they were a well trained highly motivated crew that believed in the mission
6631442 as combat engineers they were proud resourceful and armed with the technical knowledge that they generally used to assist the mission in helping the people of kandahar province
6631443 these three soldiers were exceptional canadians who made a selfless choice to serve their nation
6631444 their sacrifice will not be forgotten we will honour their sacrifice by continuing on with this vital mission
6631445 he was a strong leader who was highly respected by those around him
6631446 he believed in what he was doing and he knew he was making a difference for the people in afghanistan
6631447 the cost is high but hopefully the end result will be worth it
6631448 he was a veteran soldier and this was his third tour in afghanistan
6631449 he was a devoted father who liked to share stories of his children with his colleagues and friends
6631450 stephan was loved by so many people his circle of friends stretch from coast to coast and his family both here and in ireland
6631451 he wanted his friends to have no fear for him because he had no fear of the mission in afghanistan we truly believe that if he came home safe that he would request to return for another tour
6631452 given the significant rally in the u s dollar that has taken place over the last two and a half weeks i think the market has gotten a little bit over extended here and weve entered into a bit of a corrective phase
6631453 for the most part the main catalyst still comes back to price action in the commodity markets and with a substantial spike higher in oil today were seeing not only the u s dollar weaken off against the major currencies but thats been a benefit for the canadian dollar given the positive correlation between crude and the loonie
6631454 i think oil prices are finding some sort of base
6631455 and we do have some issues going on now the u s dollar declining again on the back of mortgage financiers freddie mac and fannie mae and this potential bailout
6631456 youre going to have everyone fearful of the unknown and fearful of bigger writedowns until we see some concrete evidence that the writedowns are slowing and some evidence that u s house price declines are slowing
6631457 what they wanted to do with me is to take my livelihood away and everything else
6631458 i dont think thats constructive to somebody whos struggling to take their passion away from them i feel very strongly about that
6631459 thats what i feel is the biggest lesson to be learned everybody does deserve a second chance or a third chance or whatever if you believe that they can actually come back and do some good
6631460 there was a time that i mean i was so far away from even dreaming of this
6631461 that this has happened that it was possible for me it involved so many other people than just me
6631462 people that have supported me and that have stood by me and have encouraged me to move on and be the best that i can be for them to really show such great support in a time where it was so easy to not support me thats where the tears come from
6631463 well if that doesnt do it i dont know what will
6631464 the evidence before me did not disclose in any way that mr lamaze is a drug addict or that his positive test was an attempt to cheat
6631465 the evidence did disclose that his personal history has left him vulnerable in some respects
6631466 i really dont want to elaborate on that if you dont mind
6631467 many times you do all these things and you still fall short
6631468 to have it all come together like that is amazing
6631469 its been a long time you cant make a comeback of something like that without having so much support from owners and friends and other riders
6631470 these are the same people mr flaherty mr baird mr clement who are responsible for what happened in walkerton who privatized ontarios propane inspection and they want to do something equivalent about food inspections which is at the core of what the government should do
6631471 this very conservative government does not understand what is at the core of the responsibility of a government in a society
6631472 let me state on behalf of the government that our thoughts and prayers are with the family and friends of those that are affected
6631473 and of course id like to reiterate that our highest priority continues to be making sure that canadian families food supply is safe
6631474 ill let mr dion draw the conclusions he wants it was a discussion document certain portions of that were brought forward in the budget and put into play but the vast majority was up for discussion and has not been implemented
6631475 as opposed to having our inspectors standing line by line theyll have a more oversight role within the plant itself
6631476 we need to have as much control over the safety of the food as possible and by even thinking that were going to give that inspection over to the industry or part of it i think is very wrong at this time
6631477 the fact of the matter is only 2 per cent of everything we eat is being monitored right now
6631478 this new policy that is being put forward is a step in the right direction
6631479 it flies in the face of all of their stated claims in terms of consumer protection
6631480 as athletes its awfully tough to handle disappointment but thats athletics
6631481 as i told the girls tonight there are going to be other things in life that are more tragic than tonight
6631482 i think these young ladies are very well prepared for what life has for them in the future and im very proud of them
6631483 its the people on the outside that really dont understand the game and really thought we were so dominant
6631484 weve played great softball but if youre in the dugout and on this team you know that any team can get hot on any given night we have a lot of respect for japan they matched us pitch for pitch and got the key hit when they needed to
6631485 i really kind of feel that maybe people would get off our back and realize there is some parity in this game because ive always thought the rest of the world was getting better its nice to see a full room of reporters here because weve had an empty room most of the time who knows what will happen i do know ive been around the game long enough to respect everyone we play sometimes the game looks easy and it really isnt
6631486 major new international softball event to take place next year
6631487 this just shows you why they shouldnt those guys work their butts off and so do we on any given day right it makes no sense to take this sport out especially now
6631488 he is one of the most creative guys ive ever met
6631489 hell come down the hall singing something and well have to include it in our show
6631490 each and every one of us in the group is accomplished in our own right and do things outside the group
6631491 when we get together it becomes quite a party a lot of people want to participate start dancing he has such an eclectic fan base
6631492 i had a sugar cane with six holes in it i used as a flute
6631493 we sang songs made makeshift guitars out of wood and hay baling wire
6631494 my mom sent my saxophone and id find other guys to play with

6631496 das ist eine riesige chance f r mich dieses angebot musste ich annehmen
6631497 j rgen r ber hat kontakt mit mir aufgenommen und gefragt ob ich mir vorstellen k nnte mit ihm zu arbeiten
6631498 ich habe dann mit bernd hollerbach gesprochen immerhin hat er sehr viel f r mich getan insgesamt war das eine ganz schwierige kiste letzten endes war es eine bauchentscheidung
6631499 ich hatte ein ganz mulmiges gef hl bei der arbeit mit den jungen spielern in den vergangenen wochen habe ich meine sentimentale seite entdeckt
6631500 es tut mir sehr leid die jungs haben in den vergangenen wochen sehr gut gearbeitet und sich erstaunlich entwickelt
6631501 das ist eine einmalige chance und die russischen mannschaften sind im kommen es gibt sachen die muss man spontan entscheiden in diesem fall bin ich felix magath und bernd hollerbach sehr dankbar die wenigen wochen beim vfl haben mich sehr weit nach vorn gebracht
6631502 the biggest thing thats been killing us all year is the mental errors
6631503 theres not a lot that separates teams in this league there are one or two players its all about the little things right everybody has talent or they wouldnt be in this league its the little things you have to work on
6631504 its not that we dont have good football players we do but good football players who make mistakes arent very good thats going to change and if it doesnt were probably going to flounder around be 9 and 9 and hope that we get into the playoffs and get our stuff together at that time
6631505 as close as you are to being a real good team there are still certain things you have to accomplish to get over that hump
6631506 its the little things and if you get a certain amount they can add up to turnovers big plays that youve given up or big plays that you could have possibly made
6631507 we dont care about saskatchewan we dont care about calgary or edmonton we care about us if we go out and do our job were going to be fine
6631508 and weve only played championship football in maybe one quarter of each game
6631509 penalties have killed us in the past and theyve hurt us this year
6631510 those are the little things those guys lions have a tremendous amount of talent next to our guys i think they have the second best receiving corps in the league and if we dont play our brand of football and take care of the little things it could be a long day
6631511 we wanted to bring their spirits down right at the beginning so they couldnt get them back up again
6631512 we were clicking on all cylinders to start the game
6631513 the guys were pumped up and ready to go having an opening like we did was amazing
6631514 theyre an explosive team and they capitalized on a great opportunity they created
6631515 they put the pedal to the metal and came after us and we didnt respond well
6631516 weve got to find a way to get players in positions to be a threat
6631517 the defense was phenomenal we challenged them to get a shutout at halftime and they did it
6631518 they rose to the occasion and showed the kind of team they want to be
6631519 was sorry that he has a drug habit the person who did this is not necessarily the person he is

6631529 minha inten o foi escrever um livro essencialmente objetivo e pr tico tal como a pr pria tarefa do professor para isso os assuntos s o divididos em tr s partes antes durante e depois da sala de aula
6631530 s o discursos complementares que interligam os textos e lhes d o acabamento
6631531 a todo momento insisto que as t cnicas de ensino devem evitar a repeti o o professor criativo muda as maneiras de ensinar variando o formato das aulas um modelo de curso que prev um nico m todo did tico do in cio at o final pouco motivador

6631555 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6631556 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6631557 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6631558 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6631559 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6631560 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in

6631586 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away
6631587 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6631588 that was the best way it could have been done
6631589 to an untrained person it might not look like the most fantastic thing but you cant get a better result than that
6631590 i was there it was done with as little stress as possible to the animal
6631591 the animal when they first got it and sedated it was very quiet very still we brought it onto the beach where it was euthanased by the vets
6631592 a very measured responsible approach to try to save it
6631593 all our experience that orrca has with cetaceans in this situation is that they very easily get stressed and a very quick dont think about it response is not the way to go
6631594 you need to gather your information talk to as many people as you can and thats exactly what national parks did

6631627 one of our most popular games is actually an advergame for guitar hero 2 by red octane
6631628 its a simplified version of the real guitar hero game that you play with your computer keyboards this advergame is also the game that is being embedded the most so its a very effective word of mouth communicator for guitar hero 2
6631629 i am not sure if marketing departments are using the full potential of viral spread of advergames yet

6631635 harper industrial is still looking around to expand its business and lancaster is still in the top three choices
6631636 we are competing against empire zone which grants zero tax responsibilities for years they are also interested in the cemetery road site which is adjacent to the kulbachs site
6631637 they have a plant that shows customers in small scale how carbon fiber is made and what it would take to build a larger version for their customers to manufacture the carbon fiber on an industry scale
6631638 they dont manufacture the product carbon fiber they manufacture the machine that manufactures the product
6631639 they are hesitant on the purchase of the walden avenue site because they need only 30 000 square feet and the facility is 76 000 square feet in size they also use a ten ton crane in the operation and that would mean extra girders would need to be installed so they dont know if they want to put that kind of money in the plant
6631640 for now they are still exploring their options and what best fits their business interests
6631641 as you know we had the library sold for 400 000 a number of years ago
6631642 and everyone in this room knows what happened and im tired of taking the heat on this csea has not officially contacted me yet rumor has it that they are considering putting something together
6631643 it is not feasible to put the recreation department in it because you have to renovate it you would then have the recreation and parks director and his staff in that building and the workers materials and equipment on pavement road i dont think that would work but if you guys want to do that im open to any suggestions
6631644 we can put in a government agency a church or a single family home in there and nobody can stop you
6631645 anything else requires a special use permit from the village of depew
6631646 it still bothers me that the last time we did this we could have accepted the 400 000 at the last minute they southeast works initialed it contract we had 400 000 in our hands that night and we were told we could not do it legally
6631647 but the village of depew would not change their rezone maybe you should think about john visone handling the matter with the village
6631648 not the first time it was before their new board took place they southeast works said they had 385 000 and rich former town attorney richard sherwood said we couldnt accept it they said we will initial the contract and go up to 400 000 and john visone was there
6631649 i take him to the grocery store to wal mart wherever we need to go
6631650 all of a sudden it started missing and backfiring and i thought i had water in my gas

6631678 uit constante gesprekken tussen fortis en specialisten van de europese commissie was al duidelijk dat de kans op uitstel erg klein was dus hebben we geen formeel verzoek tot uitstel ingediend en zijn we doorgegaan met wat volgens ons de beste oplossing was
6631679 het smeken voor uitstel was slechts beeldspraak om aan te geven dat we hard gezocht hebben naar een andere oplossing
6631680 could we imagine the olympics without national teams imagine a world where the best athletes are able to compete this is definitely not the current olympic system the country quota system keeps many of the best athletes home if i were the fifth best backstroker in the world id be upset that i couldnt compete because of when i was born snip the beginnings of a new trend are indirectly pushing us toward more meritocratic and less nation centric olympics citizenship is becoming more fluid for olympic athletes and its improving the quality of competition at the games in both individual and team events snip a free market for olympic citizenship would reduce the sometimes arbitrary control of national olympic committees national olympic committees would need to be more responsive to athletes who had expanded choice

6631692 security threats both online and offline have increased dramatically over the last few years and with 16 year olds hacking into network servers and mainframes we believe we cannot afford to ignore potential security risks even when we already have advanced security systems in place
6631693 we handle a wide variety of outsourced processes such as telemarketing customer support records retrieval accounting amp finance and many others all of which involve the sharing of confidential data and information either related to clients or their customers we very well understand the importance of ensuring the security of confidential data and information and its the same reason why we have decided to upgrade our security systems
6631694 for offline threats we have installed the latest biometric security systems that are virtually impossible to tamper with
6631695 as for online security threats we have installed advanced network monitoring systems that keep a log of each and every activity and of every individual unit connected to the network
6631696 we have also installed special software systems that can automatically detect a security breach based on the parameters provided and set the alarm bells ringing in our network security department security threats may also arise from outside sources and keeping that in mind we have also installed the most advanced firewall and anti virus systems on our network servers all these together are helping us sustain our clean record and also in making our offshore outsourcing center one of the most secure in the industry

6631716 we call for opening up the debates the scope of discussion must be as broad and deep as the serious challenges we face as a nation we agree that vibrant debate is the heart beat of our democracy and our first amendment especially during an election year we recognize that smaller third parties and independents have traditionally played a vital role in our democracy including leading the charge for the abolition of slavery the womens right to vote and economic justice for workers and farmers we support opening up the debates beyond the two parties and the so called commission on presidential debates which is a private corporation co chaired by former chairman of the republican and democratic parties its time for our presidential debates to once again be hosted by truly non partisan civic minded associations
6631717 the raider organization the national football league and the world have lost a great man gene upshaws career successes as a professional football player and a union leader are unparalleled he is as prominent a sportsman as the world has known he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy we loved him and he loved us we will miss him our hearts go out to terri and the boys
6631718 we are deeply saddened and shocked by the sudden and unexpected death of our leader gene upshaw our thoughts and prayers go out to his wife terri and their three sons eugene justin and daniel
6631719 gene learned he was sick just this past sunday and he died with his family at his side we ask that the media respect our need to begin the process of dealing with this unexpected tragedy and to begin the grieving process
6631720 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction

6631722 speculators in the energy futures markets play a much larger role than previously thought

6631741 im not sure its fair to say that ignorance is growing but we need to remember that people are moving in and out of contracting all the time
6631742 todays marketplace will contain a lot of contractors who were not around in 1999 and the early 2000s when everyone was keeping very close tabs on the latest ir35 developments
6631743 getting the message across to contractors that this is something they absolutely must do on pain of a possible tax bill for tens of thousands of pounds is a never ending task
6631744 an outside ir35 opinion given say three years ago may not be the same now

6631765 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6631766 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later

6631773 cash flow is a better measure of the discretionary resources available to firms than profits for the big five iocs operating cash flow shown in figure 2 was slightly more than two and a half times higher in 2006 than the average levels prevailing in the 1996 99 period rising from roughly 60 billion in the late 1990s to 154 9 billion in 2005
6631774 but while prices profits and cash flow have risen dramatically investment in exploration has not especially by the largest iocs
6631775 development expenditures reflect investments in fields that have already been discovered and are the easiest most cost effective way to boost output in the short run nonetheless it is investment in the exploration of new fields that will assure the long term viability of these firms
6631776 share buybacks equity repurchases have absorbed a growing share of these outlays rising from only 1 in 1993 to 37 1 in 2006 while expenditures on exploration account for a decreasing proportion declining from 13 8 in 1993 to only 5 8 in 2006 it is interesting to note that despite an almost 50 increase in exploration expenditures from 2005 to 2006 these expenditures as a share of the total increased from 5 3 to only 5 8
6631777 smaller firms are more aggressive in spending for reserves additions than the big five through growing exploration outlays and through acquisitions from other firms
6631778 the big five are gradually depleting their reserves with an average replacement ratio of only 82 in the period since 1999 as compared with 147 for the next 20 8
6631779 to some extent the decline for the big five is attributable to the downward restatement of reserves especially by royal dutch shell
6631780 the oil production of the five largest oil companies has declined since the mid 1990s oil production for the five largest oil companies fell from 10 25 million b d in 1996 to 9 45 million b d in 2005 before rebounding to 9 7 million b d in 2006 by contrast for the next 20 u s independent oil firms their oil production has risen since 1996 from 1 55 million b d in 1996 to about 2 13 million b d in 2005 and 2006
6631781 increasingly the iocs have become more like general contractors coordinating the operation of a number of suppliers who themselves are the ones who undertake seismic work analyze data provide drilling rigs and crews and a host of oil field services the larger iocs also serve the function of bankers providing the vast amount of financial resources required to mount greenfield projects in increasingly unfavorable and difficult environments they also provide the management organizational skills and oversight that these large projects require
6631782 the question is whether nocs will find this role increasingly useful or whether they believe that such operational planning functions can either be performed by themselves or be farmed out to a service company under a fee for service structure the fact that iocs have had a poor record in recent years avoiding giant cost overruns on mega projects in kazakhstan the sakhalin islands and the middle east means that nocs might be skeptical of the benefits being offered by iocs moreover investors are also questioning whether there is a continued role for the largest firms in a world where the average size of new finds is declining smaller e amp p firms have lower costs than the large bureaucratic iocs they might have an advantage in finding and developing the remaining reserves that are available to private firms stock markets reflect these perceptions with the shares of nocs and american independents generally performing better than ioc shares

6631806 all i want for christmas is to make another movie with
6631807 it struck me that there was a story to tell about a child who had the natural ability for this kind of activity but who didnt have access to the resources or coaching to pursue it as these other kids had
6631808 i would watch and think about her i would start telling my friends and my family the story about this little girl and the spelling bee but i never wrote it
6631809 akeelahs afraid to participate in the spelling bee because she doesnt think its for her then as i found my way into the story rather than looking at her as somebody who was other than me i found myself i was then able to write the story in about a month
6631810 an eleven year old african american kid striving to get to a gigantic contest
6631811 it helped people understand that spelling bees could be very exciting but really its much more than that its about confronting our fears and overcoming obstacles on the way to achieving our goals
6631812 he lived with the story for years before he wrote the script it was in his heart and in his mind doug could have sold the script a hundred times but we were all intent for him to direct it
6631813 because of where she comes from has a sense that nothing good comes from her neighborhood thats what shes been told she asks how good am i the fact larabee comes from where she does and has had the success that hes had empowers her to get to the place where she thinks she can accomplish this task that was important to me
6631814 keke was very special she was the only kid that moved her eyes back and forth as if she was actually reading something that was on the wall
6631815 it was powerful to watch i was not looking for a kid to whom i could dictate a part i wanted somebody who understood akeelah and with whom i could have a collaborative relationship who as an actor would make this character her own keke displayed all those qualities
6631816 as a director doug was completely capable of guiding me
6631817 and helping me realize the character i needed to be
6631818 its been a real wonderful relationship to watch and see evolve their banter back and forth etc hes almost a father figure type
6631819 we put a little demonstration tape together to show lionsgate and 2929 that we found our lead actress
6631820 shes always there you know a big personality on set and its funny just to watch her put a smile on everybody elses face
6631821 shes a wonderful actress and shes really going to go far
6631822 larabee is vulnerable and we discover a very sensitive guy laurence plays that extremely well yet he brings to the screen a quiet moral authority that this character has and working with him ive learned that he can just sort of be there and do very small things and communicate a lot to the camera and to the audience
6631823 he liked the project so much that he was willing to come onboard at an affordable rate for us hes an incredibly strong actor and has an incredible presence
6631824 i read the script and i was really moved by it the heart of the story is the relationship between akeelah and dr larabee but also important is the story about community this young girl doesnt think too highly of the place she comes from then she begins to learn through her experience that in fact she does come from a very tight knit supportive and concerned community people do care love and support her
6631825 they have a history together that helps this film because people know them already and therefore have certain expectations ours is a small movie in terms of the budget but big in terms of what it wants to do in its heart so its not usual to get actors of that stature and caliber to be in a film like this
6631826 we just talk to each other and we trust each other
6631827 i think thats the main thing its safe to fall and dive we dont really chat a lot about what were doing we just really go with it feed off and listen to each other look into the other sides
6631828 because she understood the thought process of the character a mother who wants the best for her daughter but is afraid that the dream will fail and make things worse angela embraced those facets of the character and gives a very powerful performance
6631829 who was the perfect choice for the school principal welch is very excitable and provides a lot of the comic relief in our story curtis is hilarious in this part
6631830 we shot a ten hour day and most movies shoot a twelve hour day three of our hours are consumed by kekes schooling which she must have every single day shes in every scene i honestly dont know how we figured it out but we did
6631831 david mullen our director of photography and i talked about it a lot beforehand we came in every day knowing the enormous number of shots we needed and the performances i wanted
6631832 the last hour of every single day was me trying to get a scene done with teachers and producers watching the clock ive got parents of the kids around me ive got actors around me there we were scurrying around trying to get a scene lit
6631833 can anything good come out of south central yes of course something good can come out of anywhere a flower can come out of a crack on the sidewalk thats just what akeelah is her beauty talent and fearlessness combine to conquer that hesitation in herself and make the entire neighborhood proud of her each success for her is a success for them
6631834 for the district bee we shot at usc where i went to school
6631835 as a film student i was never able to shoot in the bovard auditorium
6631836 george was reviewing words with his paideia which is the bible for spelling bee kids he was reviewing all these amazing words that id never heard of let alone imagine spelling
6631837 and the idea was originally if we could bring a kid who had some acting chops which george does have then we would definitely go for it
6631838 i really admire the kids who do this george is really nice and i respect him a lot its hard to do school work and all these other things and then go home and practice for the spelling bees
6631839 i was amazed at not only at how precise it was in its recreation
6631840 but also how authentic the individuals and the casting for the event was it was phenomenal the spellers looked like the real spellers the judges looked like the real judges it was very exciting
6631841 doug is a talented writer and director and the cast is exceptional were excited to give our millions of customers the opportunity to discover this film we know they are going to love it
6631842 i call it a sports movie one thats full of emotion people will cry you root for the spellers because theyre kids so youll have the visceral feeling of rooting for the movie as well
6631843 sean penn tops his performance in mystic river with the assassination of richard nixon this may be the leanest and most devastating performance of his career understated and eloquent
6631844 dazzling a lasting piece of art the highest possible thumbs up for penn and a big thumbs up for first time director
6631845 penn gives the most engrossing performance of his career to date this is one of the rare movies to explore american materialism through the eyes of an all too ordinary person who isnt up to the challenges of everyday life
6631846 a timely tragedy about the american dream twisted by bureaucracy political corruption and suburban alienation
6631847 another right on performance a mesmerizing portrayal some may even see a bit of themselves in this tragic mix of
6631848 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support

6631852 when this critical column buckled due to lack of floor supports it was the first domino in the chain
6631853 what followed in rapid succession was a progression of structural failures failure first occurred all the way to the roof line involving all three interior columns on the most eastern side of the building then progressing from east to west across wtc 7 all of the columns in the core of the building failed finally the entire fa ade collapsed
6631854 wtc 7 did not enter free fall according to nist analysis of wtc 7 video the building collapsed 18 stories in 5 3 seconds if the building exhibited free fall this process would have taken just 3 9 seconds the actual collapse time exceeded the free fall time by 40 percent

6631876 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
6631877 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
6631878 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
6631879 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
6631880 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
6631881 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
6631882 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
6631883 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
6631884 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
6631885 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
6631886 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
6631887 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
6631888 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
6631889 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
6631890 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
6631891 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
6631892 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
6631893 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
6631894 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
6631895 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
6631896 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
6631897 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
6631898 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
6631899 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
6631900 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
6631901 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
6631902 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
6631903 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
6631904 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
6631905 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
6631906 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
6631907 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
6631908 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

6631911 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
6631912 i have a lot of fond memories from last year but i hope it doesnt happen again
6631913 it was a little surreal you still knew what was going on and you knew someone was going to win but you knew the odds werent in anyones favor when that happened
6631914 from my perspective having finished early and having been behind by two strokes you never expect to be in a playoff
6631915 thats my hope to get my game back to get my mind back to practice the right things
6631916 i still feel like there is something out there for me with the way competition is youve got to always feel that way
6631917 the comparative treatment given to the members of a group when benefits and burdens are distributed when rules and laws are administered when members of a group cooperate or compete with each other and when people are punished for the wrongs they have done or compensated for the wrongs they have suffered
6631918 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
6631919 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
6631920 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
6631921 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
6631922 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
6631923 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
6631924 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
6631925 who are open to doing something on the production side
6631926 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
6631927 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
6631928 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
6631929 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
6631930 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
6631931 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
6631932 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
6631933 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

6631936 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
6631937 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
6631938 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
6631939 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
6631940 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
6631941 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
6631942 western leaders anxiously watching for a withdrawal and puzzling over how to punish moscow for what they called a disproportionate reaction to the georgian offensive
6631943 the june 24 1992 sochi agreement established a cease fire between the georgian and south ossetian forces and defined both a zone of conflict around the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali and a security corridor along the border of south ossetian territories the agreement also created the joint control commission jcc and a peacekeeping body the joint peacekeeping forces group jpkf the jpkf is under russian command and is comprised of peacekeepers from georgia russia and russias north ossetian autonomous republic as the separatist south ossetian government remained unrecognized south ossetian peacekeepers however serve in the north ossetian contingent the organization for security and cooperation in europe osce agreed to monitor the ceasefire and facilitate negotiations
6631944 security corridor along the the border of the south ossetian territories
6631945 it may not be possible to rescue south ossetia tiny and without resources from becoming a russian protectorate or even part of the russian federation and most of its people seem to want that

6631948 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
6631949 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
6631950 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
6631951 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
6631952 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
6631953 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas

6631973 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
6631974 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
6631975 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

6631977 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
6631978 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

6631982 its pretty humbling isnt it for an old fisherman and surfer in queensland who now and then plays a bit of cricket
6631983 its an amazing achievement and to be mentioned is something im very proud about and i cant believe he even said that
6631984 just to see him dance and carry on is truly inspirational and for him to have me in his mind is just so humbling

6632014 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

6632063 all corporal punishment whether or not it causes significant physical injury represents a violation of each students rights to physical integrity and human dignity it is degrading and humiliating damaging the students self esteem and making him or her feel helpless
6632064 in the 13 southern states where corporal punishment is most prevalent african american students are punished at 1 4 times the rate that would be expected given their numbers in the student population and african american girls are 2 1 times more likely to be paddled than might be expected

6632129 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6632130 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6632131 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6632132 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6632133 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6632134 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6632135 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6632136 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6632137 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6632138 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6632139 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6632140 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights

6632161 its been a long time in olympic volleyball since the top two teams from each pool won all the quarterfinal matches it happened yesterday 1 brazil defeated china 2 russia beat bulgaria 2 italy beat poland and 1 usa came back to defeat serbia in five tough games throughout our match with serbia i had two feelings one i felt we were always playing catch up with their great setter he was a step ahead of us tactically i dont think we ever caught up we just made some big plays in game five to win it secondly i kept saying to myself something hit the floor for long periods of time they touched controlled and dug everything we sent their way i dont know the serbian coach but i respect the way they play and the way that he coaches on this night we were just a little better

6632166 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6632167 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6632168 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6632169 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6632170 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6632171 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6632172 im sure our female audience would appreciate it and dont forget the umpires and referees a little black and white striped skintight number with sequins would surely boost ratings

6632315 many of the poorest households end up paying more for their energy and water bills because they dont have bank accounts and cant pay by direct debit

6632339 the government after years of incarcerating dr al arian and spending millions of the taxpayers dollars was unable to get a single conviction by a federal jury in this case yet theyve used every trick in the book to persecute dr al arian and his family through this ordeal dr al arian has endured being subjected to such things as inhumane periods of 23 hour lock down being deliberately improperly dressed while forced to walk in sub freezing weather and sporadically threatened with abuse from guards and u s marshals clearly outrageous displays of government corruption and abuse of power in spite of an agreement intended to resolve his case once and for all the government has continued to harass dr al arian and mire him further in legal purgatory
6632340 as a community we must continue to insist that the government end its manipulation of the
6632341 we are very aware of the history of mormons as a group that was chastised in america
6632342 they can be a good model for any group that feels alienated

6632344 when i go to a mormon church i feel at ease

6632346 in seeking to improve the r 1 visa rules we have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater while i applaud the efforts of homeland security officials to reduce fraud in the r 1 program the proposed changes must not exclude or impede legitimate visa applicants of non judeo christian faiths
6632347 uscis should bear in mind that religious workers of certain faiths do not receive seminary type training and not all faiths are governed by a central body and therefore the absence of these factors should not automatically disqualify an individual seeking an r 1 visa
6632348 we are a tolerant and inclusive society and our laws should reflect these values
6632349 the result would be a domino effect of discrimination against 1 000s of foreign religious workers
6632350 provides a religious worker visa classification that appropriately balances the need to prevent fraud with the imperative to remain open to legitimate religious workers of all faiths

6632355 we rely very heavily on the national institutions as a drawing card into the city

6632364 we are likely to get the benefits of the increase in our pay after durga puja but we are planning to celebrate the puja in a grand style this year as the hike in our salaries will increase our purchasing power during the festive season
6632365 the fourth pay panel took a year to submit its report and it was implemented two years after it was released the fifth pay panel should release its report quickly and the state should pay interim allowance to employees so that the burden of inflation on government employees can be somewhat less
6632366 keeping in mind the tourist season and law and order situation in the hills we will not observe the strike
6632367 it also reinforces the unions call to the government not to reduce tariffs any further while weve got these pressures on with the companies
6632368 it doesnt make sense that were going to rush ahead of the rest of the world in some cases to reduce our tariffs from 10 to 5 per cent when countries such as malaysia have a tariff regime of 300 per cent

6632383 the situation is bad in north bengal especially in darjeeling and the dooars where the nepalese people are infiltrating in large numbers resulting in a rapid demographic change

6632385 the governments have agreed to a talk on the statehood issue but with whom let the authorities first segregate the indian gorkhas from the nepali infiltrators and then think of any dialogue however we are opposed to any further division of bengal and will resist such move at any cost

6632393 the track uniform is a point of emphasis by the nfhs this year in an effort to have more consistent and widespread enforcement of the rule because of her muslim faith there were reports that her uniform undergarment was ruled unacceptable on religious grounds while kellys faith requires her to cover all parts of the body except her hands and face a single colored undergarment with a hood would have been acceptable both from an nfhs rules standpoint as well as meeting the requirements of her muslim faith http www nfhs org web 2008 01 nfhs responds to maryland track aspx on february 3 2008 at 8 19 pm franflipp said wednesday jan 30 2008 gazette net officials religion not issue in runners exclusion incident involving the color of a muslim girls uniform has been blown out of proportion district administrator says by chay rao and stephanie siegel staff writers montgomery school officials recently came under fire for being insensitive and even racist after a muslim girl was told she could not participate in a county track meet because of her uniform which covered her head arms and legs in accordance with muslim customs but according to montgomery county public schools officials religion had nothing to do with the ruling made by an event referee and mcps employees had no authority to overrule the decision this has been a colossal misunderstanding

6632411 in an hour long discussion the minister listened intently to the various aspects of the demand we presented before him he maintained that our demand was constitutional and not anti national assuring us that he would confer the issue with the prime minister congress president mrs sonia gandhi and the union home minister
6632412 mr mukherjee informed us that the congress is not averse to the creation of smaller states in the year 2000 a committee chaired by him had considered the gorkhaland demand since he has now got a first hand account of facts he would take further steps concerning the demand

6632416 profoundly lament the accident that occurred this afternoon in barajas airport and pray to the lord of life for the eternal repose of the numerous mortal victims as well as for the recovery of the wounded
6632417 to unite intensely in their personal and liturgical prayer so that the god of infinite mercy will receive those who died in the place of light and peace that he will grant health to the wounded and console all the relatives with the hope of eternal life
6632418 we have great hope that benedict xvi will visit china
6632419 we have desired this for a long time and hope it will materialize
6632420 bishop li shans interview can be considered as one of the signs with which the chinese side responds to the willingness and desire expressed by the pope in his letter from a year ago addressed to chinese catholics to seek a normalization of relations between china and the holy see
6632421 to talk about a trip of the pope to china is completely premature however bishop li shans words manifest that all chinese catholics love and respect the pope that they acknowledge his authority and would be happy to receive him and this is certainly a very positive and encouraging thing
6632422 relations with the vatican are ever better we can say that there are important developments
6632423 several important problems have not been resolved but on the part of the holy see there is the intention and the will to continue promoting a loyal and constructive dialogue
6632424 the intense pressure of work the lack of recognition difficulties concerning the magisterium loneliness the dwindling number of priests but also of communities of the faithful
6632425 the question is also asked how we priests confronted by the new challenges can help one another in a brotherly community at the various levels of the diocese diaconate and pastoral and parish unit
6632426 i would like to examine two fundamental aspects on the one hand the irreplaceableness of the priest the meaning and the manner of the priestly ministry today and on the other and this is more obvious than it used to be the multiplicity of charisms and the fact that all together they are church
6632427 will always be a need for the priest who is totally dedicated to the lord and therefore totally dedicated to humanity we are consigned to the lord separated from ordinary life but on the other hand we are consigned to him because in this way we can belong to him totally and totally belong to others
6632428 part of this moreover is truly making oneself available to the lord in the fullness of ones being and consequently finding oneself totally available to men and women i think celibacy is a fundamental expression of this totality and already for this reason an important reference in this world because it only has meaning if we truly believe in eternal life and if we believe that god involves us and that we can be for him
6632429 i know well how difficult it is today when a priest finds himself directing not only one easily managed parish but several parishes and pastoral units when he must be available to give this or that counsel and so forth how difficult it is to live such a life i believe that in this situation it is important to have the courage to limit oneself and to be clear about deciding on priorities
6632430 a fundamental priority of priestly life is to be with the lord and thus to have time for prayer
6632431 i would therefore like to emphasize whatever the demands that arise it is a real priority to find every day i would say an hour to be in silence for the lord and with the lord as the church suggests we do with the breviary with daily prayers so as to continually enrich ourselves inwardly to return as i said in answering the first question to within the reach of the holy spirits breath
6632432 and to order priorities on this basis i must learn to see what is truly essential where my presence as a priest is indispensable and where i cannot delegate anyone else and at the same time i must humbly accept when there are many things i should do and where my presence is requested that i cannot manage because i know my limits i think people understand this humility
6632433 i am thinking of movements and of many other forms of collaboration in the parish
6632434 n ew forms of collaboration should be created and interchanges encouraged
6632435 you rightly said that in this it is important to look beyond the parish to the diocesan community indeed to the community of the universal church which in her turn must direct her gaze to see what is happening in the parish and what the consequences are for the individual priest
6632436 priests even if they live far apart are a true community of brothers who should support and help one another in order not to drift into isolation into loneliness with its sorrows it is important for us to meet one another regularly
6632437 so that we can experience being together ever anew learn from one another mutually correct and help one another cheer one another and comfort one another so that in this communion of the presbyterate together with the bishop we can carry out our service to the local church precisely no priest is a priest on his own we are a presbyterate and it is only in this communion with the bishop that each one can carry out his service
6632438 in his message to the church in china the holy father attempted to address both those who have heroically resisted the persecutions and continued their clandestine existence absolutely excluding any contact with the chinese civil authorities as well as those who despite having made too many compromises have tried to take advantage of the meager space measured out carefully which the political authorities offered
6632439 it is difficult to assess from the outside the thin line that exists between a cowardly retreat from a prophetic stand and prudence to keep what can be saved in face of oppression
6632440 the holy father has invited both groups without condemning anyone to overcome their lack of mutual trust and build the unity of the body of christ on the basis of forgiveness and reconciliation and unity with the universal church
6632441 has carefully avoided launching quick accusations and has abstained from passing a moral judgment of condemnation emphasizing the fact that in moral assessments it is necessary to take into account the true intentions of a person who makes difficult prudential decisions
6632442 the fundamental principle according to which in all moral acts in addition to the objective light that comes from the moral law both the personal consideration made by the agents reason as well as the agents interior intention are of decisive significance will be useful we hope when it comes to reading recent history and to overcoming the climate of suspicion and mistrust that life often engenders under totalitarian regimes
6632443 the assessment of thorny issues considered in the context of external oppression calls above all for respect sympathy and a feeling of compassion toward those who were forced to act in the face of impossible dilemmas only in a climate of respect and understanding will the wounds caused by persecution fear and suspicion come to be cured
6632444 words of caution so that grave injustices will not be committed on the part of those who living in a different social context apply simplistic criteria in their easy condemnations
6632445 it is necessary as john paul ii said in his may 2006 address to priests in warsaw cathedral to sincerely practice penance for past infidelities avoiding arrogant judgment of past generations who lived in another time and in other circumstances
6632446 is aware that reconciliation cannot be effected from one day to the next prayer and patience are needed
6632447 the holy father inspires hope and wishes to touch the hearts of people so that change can take place
6632448 no matter how serious the limitations to freedom are people must choose in fact the fidelity of catholics in china at the cost of great sufferings is much praised in the letter
6632449 a charity with which the pope requests reconciliation and forgiveness and a clarity with which he states that the church in china must be built on the rock of peter through the bishops communion with the pope
6632450 touches the crucial point of the problem the original cause of the rupture of unity
6632451 in recent years the church has enjoyed greater religious freedom than in the past but there still are great limitations which are harmful for the church and of no advantage for the state
6632452 catholics in china have been told to ignore the letter which has been removed from web sites priests and assistants have been asked not to speak about it
6632453 precisely what was needed to stimulate peoples appetite to look for it
6632454 as religious leaders we understand and support the need to apprehend and arrest individuals who are responsible for felonies and other serious crimes
6632455 the enforcement of just laws is necessary for public safety and the common good
6632456 but the arrest of serious criminals is not what we have observed in the arrest and detention of immigrants that has taken place recently in our state particularly in newport and in providence
6632457 what we have witnessed is that the police action of immigration and custom enforcement against immigrants has divided the community instilled fear in our streets disrupted the everyday life of good people and separated family members innocent of any crime from one another
6632458 the confusing and secretive detention of those arrested has further complicated the situation
6632459 as religious leaders concerned for our people we would be negligent of our pastoral duties if we didnt speak out against these unjust government policies and practices
6632460 evaluate the morality of their participation in immigration raids in the context of their faith and sanctity of their conscience
6632461 if their discernment leads them to the conclusion that they cannot participate in such raids in good conscience we urge them not to do so
6632462 if ice agents refuse to participate in immigration raids in conformity with their faith and conscience we urge the federal government to fully respect the well founded principles of conscientious objection
6632463 you will not be able to care for the souls of others if you let your own perish in the end you will no longer do anything even for others you must always have time for being with god
6632464 cannot pray so much you must do it for us basically it is your job as it were to be the one who prays for us
6632465 high ranking officials of the philippine national police and the department of interior and local government
6632466 there are reports of bookies a scheme where bets below p10 are not being remitted to stl and are instead being drawn outside
6632467 stl is a national project and it would take only a national level intervention to stop it
6632468 there is no economic benefit if we involve in jueteng we are the legal operators of stl we operate in the open we are in the mainstream we are legitimate business people
6632469 also there are big risks our license could be revoked and that does not commensurate any gain if there is
6632470 wow its utterly amazing how you think so highly of yourself whatever gets you to sleep at night
6632471 our knowledge regarding what happens to the body with age is really changing
6632472 it used to be that the gold standard for physical performance was 20 but now you have people who are continuing to train and are pushing the age curve up
6632473 i liken it to a pianist who has done very deliberate practice for 50 years that individual will know exactly what is needed to perform the piece
6632474 the older athlete is aware of how his or her body has changed with age and will anticipate what is needed to perform
6632475 we are learning that exercise actually reverses some basic aspects of aging at the molecular level
6632476 exercise doesnt just make muscles stronger it makes muscles younger
6632477 our goal is to be able to take a biopsy from the quadriceps muscle from someone who is 50 for example and to know whether the person has the muscle of someone younger or older
6632478 we had legitimate questions at the beginning of our research
6632479 was running on hard surfaces going to cause the knees to age prematurely and would the body in general fall apart from too much abuse and overtake any health benefits that occur in the short term
6632480 there is increased importance placed on the role of recovery on giving a body rest
6632481 older athletes should not train 7 days a week if youre 40 you can perform like youre 25 but you cant train like youre 25
6632482 a lot of exercise being done now comes from exercises once done for rehabilitation after an injury
6632483 ten years ago core training that focuses on strengthening the torso didnt exist pilates yoga bridges on the floor stability balls
6632484 michael phelps knew which days he would need to be at his absolute best
6632485 so his trainers created a routine working back from his competition date
6632486 at the games in italy youd see all of these wiry gray haired people in their warm ups running and jumping
6632487 you see how active they are running does retard the aging process and thats no small thing
6632488 i just love it its so gossipy and superficial its amazing
6632489 my manager and agent just called to tell me that ive been offered a guest appearance on a new comedy series airing on fox this fall
6632490 on rainy lake there is a cabin that was built 60 or 70 years ago
6632491 its a tax grab at the expense of those who live in or have a cabin in unorganized areas in other words its a tax grab on those who live in northern ontario
6632492 these are people who pay for their own sewage water garbage disposal and things like fire protection
6632493 people oftentimes build their own roads and maintain it as a group they go to great lengths to hold pancake breakfasts and fish fries to raise money for their fire departments none of this tax grab will go toward paying those types of services
6632494 he assaults the clerk with a caustic chemical probably pepper spray and from that point on this is a robbery the clerk runs around from the counter it appears that hes going to try to escape but instead he puts up his fists and puts up a fight with the suspect
6632495 the clerk at that point probably could have fled to safety but instead tries to defend that property and goes back behind the counter and he gets beat with the hammer by the suspect
6632496 you may come for the food but youre definitely going to stay for the conversation
6632497 once you see the people who are passionate about food and see recipes and see stories behind the recipes youre hooked
6632498 it feels like friends and families sharing recipes as opposed to kind of cold and chef like
6632499 so we started chatting and its weird because she literally lives like two miles from me
6632500 result in far fewer trucking companies being able to service the ports
6632501 these are both well known national trucking companies they are very serious players
6632502 im taken aback now they are going to out of state companies rather than dealing with california trucking businesses that have been hauling cargo in and out of the ports for the past 25 to 30 years
6632503 it shows that the los angeles plan is attractive and trucking companies are biting
6632504 these commitments are proof that environmental labor and business leaders agree that our plan will deliver the cleanest trucks for the long haul
6632505 the reason i mention my column which isnt online anymore is that i remember receiving a rather large number of angry emails and calls
6632506 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
6632507 the modern day problems of healthcare in america have become all too familiar growing uninsured and underinsured populations skyrocketing costs dwindling employee health benefits avoidable illness health disparities based on race ethnicity and income it is time for america to address fundamental flaws in how we pay for healthcare coverage it is time to correct rules and health insurance policies that limit the availability and affordability of coverage especially for those with low earnings or no employee health benefits the american medical association has a new proposal to expand insurance coverage and improve fairness by shifting government spending to those most likely to be uninsured and underinsured people with lower incomes

6632522 weve overcome things far worse than what is going on right now
6632523 what concerns me more than anything is our savings rate
6632524 the problem is getting the public understanding and the political will to do something about it
6632525 the important thing to remember is that the pie gets larger over time and theres more to divide up

6632536 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6632537 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6632538 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6632539 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6632540 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6632541 we want to bring in a team of experts in contracting and agreements to do a thorough review so we can do the right thing
6632542 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
6632543 the bush administrations proposed regulation poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
6632544 womens ability to manage their own health care is at risk of being compromised by politics and ideology
6632545 words in that draft led some to misconstrue the departments intent
6632546 this regulation is consistent with my intent to focus squarely on the issue of conscience rights this specifically goes to the issue of abortion and conscience
6632547 this regulation does not seek to resolve any ambiguity in that area it focuses on abortion and focuses on physicians conscience in relation to that
6632548 i think this provides broad application not just to abortion and sterilization but any other type of morally objectionable procedure and research activity
6632549 we think its badly needed our members are facing discrimination every day and as we get into human cloning and all sorts of possibilities its going to become even more important
6632550 there is nothing in this rule that would in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
6632551 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
6632552 we want to push the genre farther forward were bringing innovation this year

6632556 its seven seven houses and heres one house americans cant afford john mccain to move into
6632557 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
6632558 one of obamas biggest fundraisers helped him buy his million dollar mansion
6632559 if we dont make a change you will have a total of between 36 to 38 states that will be voting the first tuesday in february in 2012 by spreading out the primary process into some orderly process benefits the system
6632560 those are the states that you can get retail politics in
6632561 the assumption or proposition that only the small states can you have retail politics is somewhat misleading and a bit condescending
6632562 the question is how do you fix it in a way that doesnt have unintended consequences
6632563 usually assistants are young folks out of law school who are excited to learn not a way station for retreads whove been criticized for their less than sterling defense of voting rights laws
6632564 todd knows hans because todd works at the heritage foundation and hans contributes to the heritage foundation he has written some things about voting rights
6632565 we have never seen a political appointee exercise this level of control over the day to day operations of the voting section
6632566 voting rights policies not seen before pushing to curb minor instances of election fraud by imposing sweeping restrictions that would make it harder not easier for democratic leaning poor and minority voters to cast ballots
6632567 we have two reports dealing with voting rights that are yet to be published and my concern is what role he will have in regard to those reports
6632568 does not have any more work to be done on the voting rights briefing
6632569 an er visit for something thats not an emergency costs the medical center 1 200
6632570 thats sucking up dollars in health care that we dont all have to just blow through carelessly
6632571 michelle inspired us to step back and take a holistic approach to this problem
6632572 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
6632573 tough budgetary decisions must be made now in order to ensure a financially healthy agency next fiscal year
6632574 its only going to be a short amount of time before a new budget gets through and the congress is committed to moving peace corps in an upward direction
6632575 it is my goal to see a growing number of highly qualified diverse and determined americans of all ages committing themselves to serve our country as peace corps volunteers
6632576 achieving this goal will require a strong nationwide recruiting presence
6632577 our intelligence community is now monitoring reports on the alleged milf npa unholy alliance and we are not taking chances on it
6632578 the most visible anti terrorists measures we initiated as of now is the presence of many checkpoints but there are measures we cant divulge for security reasons of our operatives
6632579 a lot of us had similar ideas at the same time and we had some connection with each other
6632580 every single person involved in this is touched by this disease in one way or another

6632587 if you only knew the magnificence of the 3 6 and 9 then you would have a key to the universe
6632588 for those who have read the past parts i have posted the final part seperate enjoy cause the real story starts soon
6632589 then lets hope it isnt to here they need to come
6632590 master carpenter lavar makvan at your service how can i help you
6632591 no time for small talk its not often i come to this side of town
6632592 ah i see your just received a delivery of wood straight to the point than i need you to construct two wagons i would like them in good quality with a few spare parts for each one
6632593 and lavar i need this finished as quickly as possible the cost will not matter in fact i will give you a bonus if you finish within three days
6632594 well the design will determine how quickly i can make these wagons of yours they will also determine the cost so the first thing i need to know is if you have your own designs or shall we go browse my prints
6632595 no need to do that i already have the design patterns that i want later tonight my servant will bring them to you
6632596 and as i said the cost doesnt matter in fact here let me give you a small advancement
6632597 you just dropped it so i picked it up i didnt do anything wrong
6632598 truly i would have been extremely angry if i lost this thank you for getting it
6632599 may i ask what the figure is supposed to be what i could tell was that is many beasts made into one
6632600 it is called a chimera i have never seen one but from what ive heard there are many different types this one as you can tell has the face and body of a lion the hind legs and wings of a hawk and even a snake as a tail you know what is really special about this thing the one who has it in his possession is not affected by magic
6632601 that would indeed be a useful ability if magic were possible
6632602 but enough of this statue i have other matters that need looking into
6632603 make sure you use your strongest wood for the wagons and dont forget my servant will bring you the designs later tonight may you find a feast
6632604 what oh the mayor he just had a job for me
6632605 perfect time too any day this little one will pop out right
6632606 what does the mayor want a table and chairs or some home repairs
6632607 just a pair of wagons and he wants them done quickly
6632608 but i cant start building until his servant brings the design later tonight
6632609 seems like another warm afternoon you can go rest again as i help them finish
6632610 well good afternoon lavar how did you post inspection go
6632611 denton you know when i make something it will always last awhile but how have things been
6632612 that much owell you cant change it speaking of money has any one requested for a carpenter to your company
6632613 not one but then again if you could tell me how the ventilation works for your home then i could get you a lot of work orders i mean do you even have a fire going on inside
6632614 as ive told you before i dont know what youre talking about my system is an ordinary one but i can see the others are ready to go so have a safe trip and may you find a feast
6632615 he asked me to brling you thease plans and to reaturn with thy cost and amount of time it take to create thy wagons
6632616 thy maylors slave hads other things to complete so i haves comes instead
6632617 well that is good i am lavar nice to meet you
6632618 come in come in lay the plans over on that table
6632619 i couldnt help but notice that youre not from these lands where do you come from
6632620 tis you be correct i hail from the broken islands
6632621 the broken islands i think i have heard of those it is said that each islands terrain is different and that it is the home of many daemons that is why i always thought it didnt exist but than again who would believe in something that always involves demons and magic
6632622 but they dos exist they exist everywhere same as magic
6632623 well i have never seen either as for the wagons they look very simple one of the simplest designs any ones every asked for if i start tomorrow i could finish in two days maybe even one day
6632624 that will be well and goods but what tis the cost
6632625 by this i will say about fifty pieces of gold
6632626 what are you talking about there are no such things as demons
6632627 her she be a demon didnt yous notice hows thy room became warmer it became warmer because she be a fire demon
6632628 my wife is right this is nonsense what you and i felt was only a draft from the fire in the kitchen no not just that if she was a daemon then she would look like a monster now can you tell me she looks like a monster
6632629 a drafts would haves passet by now yet the warmth remains it remains because she remains the change the change is usually slow but their are those that never change
6632630 how about the other stories a demon cant get pregnant well my wife is
6632631 then she not a full demon she be a half demon they cans have children those children are monsters themselves your child wills be a demon alsos
6632632 get out i will not stand here and let you insult my wife so get out and tell you master his wagons will be completed by the day
6632633 dont be ridicules what he felt was a draft from the kitchen as you walked in
6632634 are you sure denton said something about how warm the workshop was or yurleen she said something while i was out shopping and then could he be right could i be a demon
6632635 i dont know why the mayor would have that crazy fool as a disciplinary just forget about what he said
6632636 take this back to the bedroom with you get some rest i am going to hurry and finish these wagons just rest and forget what he said
6632637 thank you youre right thank you goodnight i love you
6632638 i had a weird dream i dreamed that i had a baby boy my lord was he gorgeous and he grew to be strong and powerful you would be so proud he even gained followers but that is what was weird many of his followers were creatures some were even dragons and where ever our son would walk flowers of ice would grow his followers made sure not to destroy the flowers then late in the dream one of the creatures stepped on a flower it shattered the beast itself was hurt from the ice even still it began to run and as it ran our son turned you wont believe this but our son our beautiful son had turned into a monster the monster chased the creature down and killed it but the worst thing was that as the monster chased the poor beast he would destroy the very path of flowers our son made even after he kill it wherever he stepped lava would raise not flowers like our son just lava
6632639 it was just a dream but do you realize how cold it is in here
6632640 here is the book you started reading a couple of days ago you just stay in bed and i am going to put a fire in the furnace after that i am going to finish with the wagons and go tell the mayor that they are complete
6632641 even if he does come the only place he will go is my workshop so dont worry about him now i am going
6632642 the mayor had a work order from me and i am here to inform his of its completion
6632643 if that is all just give geno here your name and you may go the mayor is a very busy man to see you himself
6632644 i would prefer to tell him myself as the mayor asked that i tell him as soon as it was done
6632645 that is fine but you will have to wait out here with us until mr jeroson comes out
6632646 no we have an order that no one is to enter at any time during certain days this just happens to be one of those days
6632647 well speaking of work do you or anybody you know need any carpentry work done
6632648 he does it about four times a week since jaland became his disciplinary
6632649 jaland i meet him last night why would the mayor have such a crazy fool as his disciplinary
6632650 you cans trys and act like magic and demons do nots exist but youlls see soons enough and after yours gone everyones else wills sees that monster and kills it
6632651 sir i have come to inform you that the wagons you requested have been completed
6632652 truly this fast well and good well and good jaland go retrieve my horse in fact grab one for lavar here and one other thing tell the men to prepare for departure
6632653 i must admit i am impressed that you were able to finish the wagons in a day how did you do it
6632654 well i am one of the best carpenters around that and i worked though most of the night and all of today
6632655 ah yes that you will receive it when i acquire the wagons
6632656 theirs you gos capenter i figureds salt woulds be wells enough for you
6632657 they tooks the side paths we shoulds overs take them shortlys
6632658 lavar jaland and i will wait atop the hill we first spoke at when the men arrive would you leave the wagons to them
6632659 there are few things i like less then a cold windy day
6632660 the cold should be the least of your worries lavar makvan
6632661 indeed i wont him aside seeing as you received your wagons and i havent received my payment i think we have only one more matter to finish mayor jeroson
6632662 now informally i still have something i would like to know
6632663 is it true that your wife makes the things around her hot
6632664 well i was just interested after jaland spoke of her
6632665 i am sorry mayor but i just dont like nor trust that man
6632666 did you know that the most common magic to men is fire
6632667 no well then i assume that you also dont know that one of the rarest type of demon is a fire type it is funny in a sort of way something that is so common to humans is so rare to daemons that being said i want to see something that rare
6632668 crazy yes i assume that is what i thought the first time i saw that man i came upon him with my hunting party several weeks ago you remember the men who took the wagons them and myself were the only ones to survive that day over twenty men died oh no jaland didnt kill them it was a single demon that did the deed of killing them
6632669 that demon had already killed six of jalands people leaving jaland the last against the monster he would indeed have died if i hadnt sent my men in to assist and do you know what jaland did as thanks
6632670 he showed me what holds you down he showed me magic
6632671 in truth i have intended to kill you from the beginning
6632672 but i will wait until i have seen this beautiful wife of yours
6632673 lavar lavar this jaland isnt listening go go get the midwife the baby is com ing
6632674 its alreadys beguns its changings afters i kills him i wills do the sames to it
6632675 wait wait i want this man to watch as you kill his wife
6632676 now uses airs magic tos force this throughs its heart
6632677 i dont cares whats yous says the onlys thing that stoppeds me froms killings hers is deads and nows thats i am frees froms that fools debts i wills kills it
6632678 you took something important from me naturally i would hunt you down
6632679 but as longs as is holds this yours magics wonts touchs me
6632680 as a gods yous must knows little in thes ways of thes sword havings always useds yours magic in battle
6632681 ands as a falses god yous wills learns thes way ofs death
6632682 you are correct i know little in the way of swords
6632683 i have a habit of not listening to voices in my head
6632684 maybe if you tell me how your able to communicate with me while i have magic canceling items then i may leave her be
6632685 if you are truly in my head then get out of it now
6632686 but then you would not be able to hear what i have to say
6632687 fine ill play how are you about to talk to me
6632688 how is it that you can use magic on me when i hold steel and why can i not see the aura of magic you used
6632689 the answer to both is that i use a different type of magic then you
6632690 i am dagrov a true daemon and your universe i about to be ours
6632691 now now kenneth i will deal with you in a minute
6632692 we were born a formless existence we were giving a universe with not light to warm us no ground to live upon we were given a dark universe of hell however today today the plans that the hunters and i formed over ten thousand years ago has finally come to an end starting today this universe of the graylings will become ours
6632693 those of you who stand before me are among the elite of the daemons your power is great your intelligence superior and your skill unmatched but my friends before you go forth to obtain a true body we have before us a grayling who attempted to keep us caged in the dark universe
6632694 who ever can render him lifeless will be able to feast on his body
6632695 if its a magic shield use magic to break it
6632696 my brothers this is not the time to waste our energy we must go forth and gain bodies remember to take the bodies of the unborn rip the soul of the grayling from out of their mothers womb and take the growing body for yourself
6632697 if jobs are going to be saved gas expenses lessened and kids get three day weekends while still attending the same amount of school it sounds like a system that will make everyones lives a little better
6632698 any time you have a drastic change such as eliminating a day out of the school week there is going to be a period of adjustment
6632699 unfortunately no one has a crystal ball in front of them and can tell exactly what is going to work and what is not
6632700 well have to go by other schools learning experiences and if it comes down to it our own
6632701 i think ive just continued to get better in the preseason in the games and in practice so this will be another step to take
6632702 to come to a decision like that weve taken a lot of things into consideration last year how orton finished the season training camp preseason games
6632703 in the end it comes down to a gut feeling that you have
6632704 completions turnovers to just the feeling we have on who can manage the game the best for us all of things like that
6632705 and the good thing about evaluating both rex and kyle weve had a long time to do it its been quite a few years weve had a chance to see both guys play
6632706 the spaceship would then be sucked from higher to lower density in a deformed portion of space time without violating einsteins theory
6632707 this idea much like many other ideas out there is one that i believe will only have life in sci fi movies
6632708 sesungguhnya kami lah yang menurunkan al quran dan sesungguhnya kami benar benar memeliharanya

6632719 hai orang orang yang beriman sesungguhnya minuman keras judi menyembah berhala dan mengundi nasib itu kotor najis sebagai amalan syetan jauhilah itu supaya kamu sekalian bahagia
6632720 kalau kamu lakukan itu kamu akan saya penjarakan kalau kamu lakukan itu kamu akan saya penggal kepalamu
6632721 kalau kau tidak berhenti minum engkau tidak akan dapat kiriman minyak

6632724 katakanlah terangkanlah kepadaku bagaimana pendapatmu jika al quran itu datang dari sisi allah padahal kamu mengingkarinya dan seorang saksi dari bani israil mengakui kebenaran yang serupa dengan yang disebut dalam al quran lalu dia beriman sedang kamu menyombongkan diri sesungguhnya allah tiada member petunjuk kepada orang orang yang dzalim
6632725 earlier this year mr guglielmucci released a hit song healer which was featured on sydney church hillsongs latest album
6632726 a lot of its due to access to first diagnostic equipment and later on to multi disciplinary specialist treatment
6632727 it also reinforces the unions call to the government not to reduce tariffs any further while weve got these pressures on with the companies
6632728 it doesnt make sense that were going to rush ahead of the rest of the world in some cases to reduce our tariffs from 10 to 5 per cent when countries such as malaysia have a tariff regime of 300 per cent
6632729 were seeing a lot more spread that is concerning to us
6632730 this year we certainly have had parents asking more questions
6632731 i think that this is an indication that the national perception of isu has changed and that reflects the growing national prominence of this university
6632732 i think the first reason for these better enrollment statistics is that we have more nationally ranked programs today than at any time in our history
6632733 kiplingers has placed the school in its top 100 public institutions for the past four years
6632734 these changes i hope will change peoples opinion about the university
6632735 this will be the tightest year for housing because of dunn barton walker and manchester being closed for renovation
6632736 with manchester open next year i believe that most of the congestion will be relieved
6632737 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6632738 we have a tough schedule the first weekend and this entire season i think it is great to start off that strong
6632739 we start off with iowa state and they are an amazing team they made it to the sweet 16 last year so i would rather start with a team like that than teams we know were going to beat
6632740 i do not really like to focus on the individual performance because right now it does not really matter what one person on the team can do
6632741 it matters what the entire team can do and right now i think our practices are running completely different than they ever have
6632742 practices are focusing on all 14 players that are in the gym and making each person better
6632743 so if my accomplishments as all conference are encouraging my teammates to do better then i am really excited about that
6632744 our goal is to win the conference title every year
6632745 we feel that we have as good a chance as anybody but we also realize that its going to take a lot of hard work there are a lot of areas we need to get better in and its just going to take a lot of work every day
6632746 the number one goal is what we did last year which is to win all conference games and be mvc champs again
6632747 we have a young team but after our exhibition game we did a lot of good things so hopefully in our conference play well just be able to execute
6632748 i was a little surprised that we were picked that high
6632749 were only returning one senior were a young team and how quickly these young players develop will determine our success last year i think we were picked to be fifth and we finished first so that kind of tells you that every team is competitive in the valley it really comes down to who comes to play on those particular days

6632752 orang kalau menyuap itu biasanya dibayar di depan atau belakang itu diberikan setelah selesainya proses penyelidikan kalau suap mestinya dibayar di depan

6632754 i believe he was superb for bulgaria against bosnia lets hope he has something left in the tank to give us victory on saturday sunday morning aest
6632755 i need to have a chat with him to see how he is physically after the match and the journey home and we will see if he is fit to play
6632756 if he does play tottenham fans are the same as anyone and if he starts scoring goals those fans who were booing him last week will be cheering him again
6632757 i am very much aware sunderland have three ex spurs players in their team
6632758 it might be an advantage or disadvantage they could be motivated to come here and do well but we are focused on making up for the defeat last weekend

6632764 do you have the number to the owner because there is a big hole in your parking lot
6632765 well let me tell you something these wheels are 1500 each if something happened because i hit the pothole and bent or chipped these wheels you would be held 100 liable
6632766 you do a great job maintaining that blog it has become essential daily viewing for myself and lots of other people i know your efforts are greatly appreciated
6632767 congrats on the site its become an addiction especially now that i am on tour
6632768 isnt matrixsynth better than a big cuppa cocoa amp a christmas cookie on a cold cold southern california morning

6632770 we can only disperse medication with a valid prescription from a doctor
6632771 the easiest way to get adderall or a drug like that is by asking someone who already has a prescription
6632772 i know students who do not have a prescription and have tried it at least once
6632773 ive seen people take an adderall and go out and drink all night
6632774 coach erik gerets has been very clear with him and has told him that players will continue to be recruited and that the majority may be ahead of him
6632775 he has had offers most notably from panathinaikos and more recently from some english clubs
6632776 theres no need to push him out the door because he has given a lot to the club and he has always behaved honorably and with dignity
6632777 we want the best possibility for him we are still in discussions here and there
6632778 there still might be one more player to come in
6632779 we have a short squad and we cant afford injuries like other clubs its fine when everyone is fit
6632780 i signed silvestre because he was the kind of player who can complete our team in every aspect of what we needed a left footed player experience at the back and some maturity as well
6632781 the thinking is that he has a great team attitude and we are a bit light in terms of experience in the dressing room so he can help us on that front
6632782 we have to make sure we do not make calamitous defensive errors and that arsenal have to work hard for their goals
6632783 whenever you play against the top four you know you are in for a tough game but we have to believe we can get a result
6632784 there is an old firm game on august 31 and we want a good display and a good result against falkirk to set us up for that because it is always a massive one
6632785 no one wants to go into old firm games after a couple of poor results
6632786 i wouldnt say we are low on confidence or anything like that but it can take you a few games just for everyone to get into their stride
6632787 if we had taken the chances we made against dundee united then it might have been a different outcome we want to win every game so it is always a bad feeling when you drop points
6632788 but it has gone now and it is far too early for anyone to start reading too much into anything
6632789 the best synth site on the web always updated always interesting

6632794 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6632795 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6632796 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6632797 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6632798 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change
6632799 i felt a great disturbance in the force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced i fear something terrible has happened
6632800 wait give me the chips i found some more cash in my purse

6632806 roma are one of the best clubs in europe its nice that my name is being associated with the giallorossi

6632808 i dont know if the president will want to let me go i havent spoken with him i dont know his position
6632809 i cannot tell you much more hes one of the players we follow
6632810 i find barry a good player the problems with players who are 27 28 is that you pay big money but you get nothing back no resale
6632811 at the moment the liverpool situation means he is not at his best
6632812 the biggest problem is anxiety by the home fans bayern are regarded as favourites so we need every man woman and child to take account of this and back the team
6632813 we have every opportunity to sit together over a coffee or have some fun were more like a family in the past we just used to train shower and go home
6632814 he should be able to begin a little light jogging at the weekend
6632815 in the past we have often made a good impression against bremen in six previous games we beat them four times and drew twice

6632817 i have a habit of not listening to voices in my head
6632818 maybe if you tell me how your able to communicate with me while i have magic canceling items then i may leave her be
6632819 if you are truly in my head then get out of it now
6632820 but then you would be able to hear what i have to say
6632821 fine ill play how are you about to talk to me
6632822 how is it that you can use magic on me when i hold steel and why can i not see the aura of magic you used

6632825 now now kenneth i will deal with you in a minute
6632826 we were born a formless existence we were giving a universe with not light to warm us no ground to live upon we were given a dark universe of hell but today today the plans that the hunters and i formed over ten thousand years ago has finally come to an end starting today this universe of the graylings will become ours
6632827 those of you who stand before me are among the elite of the daemons your power is great your intelligence superior and your skill unmatched but before you go forth to obtain a true body we have before us a grayling who attempted to keep us caged in the dark universe
6632828 who ever can render him lifeless will be able to feast on his body
6632829 if its a magic shield use magic to break it
6632830 my brothers this is not the time to waste our energy we must go forth and gain bodies remember to take the bodies of the unborn rip the soul of the grayling from out of their mothers womb and take the growing body for yourself

6632839 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further

6632843 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6632844 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition

6632849 i dont get paid nearly enough to put up with all of your shit
6632850 was to injure it so long as it refused to listen to the just claims of his country
6632851 in the past you have encouraged many a troubled soul to trust in god you have supported those who were weak your words have strengthened the fallen you steadied those who wavered but now when trouble strikes you faint and are broken does your reverence for god give you no confidence shouldnt you believe that god will care for those who are upright
6632852 if my sadness could be weighed and my troubles be put on the scales they would be heavier than all the sands of the sea that is why i spoke so rashly for the almighty has struck me down with his arrows he has sent his poisoned arrows deep within my spirit all gods terrors are arrayed against me dont i have a right to complain wild donkeys bray when they find no green grass and oxen low when they have no food people complain when there is no salt in their food
6632853 does 1 corinthians 14 34 35 mean that women should not speak in church services today
6632854 women have much to contribute and can participate in worship services in the corinthian culture women were not allowed to confront men in public apparently some of the women who had become christians thought that their christian freedom gave them the right to question men in public worship this was causing division in the church paul was asking the women not to flaunt their christian freedom during worship the purpose of pauls words was to promote unity not to teach about womens role in the church
6632855 the godly offer good counsel they know what is right from wrong they fill their hearts with gods law so they will never slip from his path

6632858 tongues then are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers prophecy however is for believers not for unbelievers
6632859 not only the arm of the virtuous woman but her speeches well ought to be not for the public and she ought to be modest and guarded about saying anything in the hearing of outsiders since it is an exposure of herself for in her talk can be seen her feelings character and disposition
6632860 the spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets
6632861 therefore my brothers be eager to prophesy and do not forbid speaking in tongues but everything should be done in a fitting and orderly way
6632862 my experience 4 8 5 3 and sums up his response by saying in the fifth chapter
6632863 we have found from experience that all this is true listen to my counsel and apply it to yourself
6632864 does your reverence for god give you no confidence shouldnt you believe that god will care for those who are upright
6632865 stop and think does the innocent person perish when has the upright person been destroyed
6632866 if god cannot trust his own angels and has charged some of them with folly
6632867 if my sadness could be weighed and my troubles be put on the scales
6632868 so let us say together hallelujah praise the lord shma yisrael allahu akbar om and store up the light against the darkness

6632876 t he core message of the gospel and the love of god for all people should take priority the older i get the more important the eternal becomes to me personally his mind is on the heavenly more than the temporal on the central promises of christianity more than on the passing political parade
6632877 the mouth of the righteous speaks wisdom and his tongue talks of justice the law of his god is in his heart none of his steps shall slide

6632955 kami berusaha memberikan yang terbaik salah satunya dengan menyediakan sistem transaksi yang mumpuni dan dapat mempermudah perdagangan
6632956 kami akan kaji ulang sistem yang tengah berjalan sekarang apakah harus menggunakan sistem cadangan yang langsung terpasang begitu sistem satunya mati berapa pun biayanya kami akan upayakan asal transaksi lancar
6632957 sistem cadangan ini sebenarnya bermanfaat jika terjadi bencana bom atau kerusuhan di kantor bursa yang menyebabkan terganggu sistem yang ada di kantor namun pagi ini kami tidak menghidupkan sistem cadangan itu karena butuh waktu lebih lama daripada memperbaiki sistem jaringan yang rusak yang berada di kantor kami
6632958 the driver is economic growth as the economy expands the domestic market starts to become bigger and it is typically a middle class market
6632959 due to economic pressures more and more companies in developed nations are seeking educated workforces in emerging markets to outsource manufacturing and service jobs
6632960 more economic pressures in the west mean more jobs in emerging markets and a bigger middle class that has higher buying power
6632961 countries like india consist of young consumers who are ambitious and save quite a bit but are also willing to spend on small luxuries like western brands of consumer packaged goods
6632962 this demonstrates that there is a big consumer economy thats being driven in china which is exactly what the western world was looking to happen many years ago and thats just china add india and were seeing consumerism pulling up a lot of the poverty in many areas
6632963 the shift from investment to increasing consumption overall and as a share of gdp is very important to sustainable growth in the long term china has maxed out on the input model
6632964 coca cola customized a product for lower price points so that those consumers can have a taste of the product as the economy grows and more people join the middle class demand will keep increasing
6632965 if youre not planning to have more business outside the u s than in the u s market then youre probably planning wrong
6632966 its important to cherish diversity but its difficult to do the best way is to put people from diverse backgrounds at equivalent levels
6632967 we blew up our idea of a headquarters and it forced more decentralization and more decision making closer to the customer
6632968 when it comes to services were pretty much in the early days
6632969 when you look globally you see an emerging middle class in some geographies and a stagnant or declining middle class elsewhere
6632970 what is truly interesting is the dynamic character of social class certainly not stable on a global basis and quite variable on a country by country or region by region basis
6632971 we need to look carefully at the various indicators on a more fine grained basis in order not to miss the variability
6632972 we have observed that if you look at the economic cycle in the last five to 10 years you see that the u s europe and japan have a cycle that is becoming disconnected from the economic cycle of the developing world
6632973 there is some disconnect its not necessarily true that all these new clients that appear in the third world will be served by u s and european firms it is not clear to us that chinese clients will prefer a u s firm for services if they can have equal quality from a chinese firm
6632974 mainly these countries have traded with the u s and europe but now there is new south south integration
6632975 in the case of consumer durables such as automobiles and washing machines supply can be expanded quickly the same goes for non durables such as soft drinks
6632976 the problem is with oil and foodstuffs a major driver of price increases for these goods has been expanded demand from china and india
6632977 it is indeed possible that increased consumption in china and india will lead to higher prices for many basic goods but the role of the middle class may not be any more than that of other groups
6632978 it is the higher consumption and might i say often the waste of resources in developing countries that is also contributing to the price rise but there is no doubt that increased consumption by those who did not have discretionary incomes in the past will contribute to price increases

6632980 im hopeful that cooler minds prevail history is full of examples of how policies restricting trade hurt the home country
6632981 the fact that this is a good thing may not mean its a good thing for the u s in the short run but as the world gets richer there should be more demand for u s products assuming the u s remains competitive
6632982 this is important because we tend to assume all middle class people have certain values

6632996 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6632997 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that

6633032 thats the thing coaches ask all the time tell us when hes going to be back we want that answer too but its impossible
6633033 there are certain things you need to be on the field to see
6633034 right now theyre throwing the whole playbook at us and they want you to remember it all what they did the first day they might not bring it back up again until today and im like man i dont remember all this
6633035 hes a physical man and we just want him to have a speedy recovery so we can get him out here on the field
6633036 were going to need that guy because hes definitely a workhorse the guy is a great back
6633037 i think its a little more slow progress than we all thought it was going to be
6633038 maybe ed has a sense of that at one time because hes the guy that feels it were still optimistic that hell be there the first week but i dont think you can say definitely right now
6633039 we continue to have doctors look at him because we want to be absolutely sure
6633040 its not just about his ability to play in a game right now nobody thinks hes at risk in any way but we want to make darn sure thats the case
6633041 you look good in your pics and if we were ever alone in a room you could get it
6633042 overall quality of life measures improved even when women did not have hot flushes and were well past menopause there was a small but measurable improvement in quality of life and a noted improvement in sleep sexuality and joint pains hrt users also had more breast tenderness and discharge compared to those on a placebo
6633043 these new data should be added to the risk benefit equation for hrt the quality of life benefits of hrt may be greater in women with more severe symptoms near menopause new research suggests that hrt taken from near menopause avoids the cardiovascular risks seen when hrt is initiated many years after menopause
6633044 early start up side effects can usually be alleviated by adjusting the treatment
6633045 for most women with significant menopause symptoms the benefits of hrt outweigh the risks
6633046 if a woman feels that hrt is needed for quality of life then doctors can find the safest regimen for her she can try going off hrt every 4 5 years and can then make an informed choice about whether she takes and continues hrt
6633047 policy makers need to realise that by taking underground water we are mining a limited resource just as digging up iron ore is mining a limited resource
6633048 if we treat it as a minable resource we will have to rethink the way we use it and perhaps we will decide that using it to water lawns for example isnt the best use of a limited resource
6633049 until now underground water has been allocated on a first come first serve basis which was fine when the supply was being recharged every year but climate change has robbed us of that and we need to think more wisely about how we allocate what we have
6633050 it just seems a particularly wet season in the context of the past four or five really dry years
6633051 its hard to tell at this stage how much recharge this years rains will bring but they wont be enough to make up for the decline of the past couple of years

6633094 this is the organizational classic a developer whos been promoted to team leader when there was no further technical route for him to advance you can plainly see that he is uncomfortable in this role he doesnt have the correct skill set and he struggles to keep up he is a programmer and he wants to program this guy is not a natural organizer or manager of people and he is a bad communicator

6633117 at this stage hes a chance but we wont know until this afternoon he looks okay and its hard to keep a bloke like milney down
6633118 he needs to train to assess whether hes ready to play and im sure theyll give him right up until game day
6633119 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6633120 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6633121 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6633122 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6633123 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6633124 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6633125 im sure our female audience would appreciate it and dont forget the umpires and referees a little black and white striped skintight number with sequins would surely boost ratings
6633126 its not about looking for who was guilty in the past or among us were all responsible
6633127 we have to recover confidence in our institutions in our state in our country
6633128 we have examined everything down to the smallest of details we have worked with anz stadium and nsw police we have spoken with manly we have spoken with our members and unfortunately we have been unable to clearly identify the perpetrator
6633129 we have done everything we can and unless someone steps forward and owns up to this or we receive further information to help with the enquiry then we consider the investigation to be closed
6633130 somebody out there knows who this cowardly person is and its only a matter of time before we know who it is as well
6633131 this is a serious incident which goes against everything our club stands for and it is poor form that a member or fan would do something like this in the first instance and secondly tar the name of the club and its members by not owning up to their mistake

6633136 we do not believe they were really interested in having people turn themselves in

6633146 had caused people to sell commodities aggressively and a lot of that selling became overdone said chip hanlon of delta global advisors
6633147 this move may tell us that those downtrends are over commodities could continue to rally from here
6633148 chinas demand is very important to the commodity markets mr hanlon said
6633149 now that theyre ready to start bringing back factories that had been idled i wouldnt be surprised to see demand start to pick up again there their long term outlook for growth and development hasnt changed

6633160 its unfortunate that this got left out but were making sure that the bill is corrected

6633162 weve been in contact with the governors office and we dont expect this to be an issue

6633172 playboy has always done classy portfolios so im sure if this was real its something that would be considered
6633173 meantime through jewish members of the russian secret police minutes of the proceedings of the basel congress in 1897 had been obtained and these were found to correspond with the protocols
6633174 these protocols were secretly extracted from a whole bookful of protocols all this was got by my correspondent out of the secret depositories of the head chancellory of zion this chancellory is at present on french territory
6633175 in our day all the governments of the entire world are consciously or unconsciously submissive to the commands of this great super government of zion because all the bonds and securities are in its hands for all countries are indebted to the jews for sums which they will never be able to pay all affairs industry commerce and diplomacy are in the hands of zion it is by means of its capital loans that it has enslaved all nations by keeping education on purely materialistic lines the jews have loaded the gentiles with heavy chains with which they have harnessed them to their supergovernment
6633176 the end of national liberty is near therefore personal freedom is approaching its close for true liberty cannot exist where zion uses the lever of its gold to rule the masses and dominate the most respectable and enlightened class of society
6633177 it is nearly four years since the protocols of the elders of zion came into my possession only god knows what efforts i have made to bring them to general notice in vain and even to warn those in power by disclosing the causes of the storm about to break on apathetic russia who seems in her misfortune to have lost all notion of what is going on around her
6633178 and it is only now when i fear it may be too late that i have succeeded in publishing my work hoping to put on their guard those who still have ears to hear and eyes to see
6633179 one can no longer doubt it the triumphant reign of the king of israel rises over our degenerate world as that of satan with his power and his terrors the king born of the blood of zion the antichrist is about to mount the throne of universal empire
6633180 events are precipitated in the world at a terrifying speed quarrels war rumours famines epidemics earthquakes everything which even yesterday was impossible today is an accomplished fact one would think that the days pass so rapidly to advance the cause of the chosen people space does not allow us to enter into the details of world history with regard to the disclosed mystery of iniquity to prove from history the influence which the wise men of zion have exercised through universal misfortunes by foretelling the certain and already near future of humanity or by raising the curtain for the last act of the worlds tragedy
6633181 only the light of christ and of his holy church universal can fathom the abyss of satan and disclose the extent of its wickedness
6633182 i feel in my heart that the hour has already struck when there should urgently be convoked an eighth oecumenical council which would unite the pastors and representatives of all christendom secular quarrels and schisms would all be forgotten in the imminent need of preparing against the coming of the antichrist

6633199 the paramount issue is the identity crisis of the indian nepali community and comes next to the vision of socio economic development yet these issues are being swept under the carpet on the assumption that once a separate state is formed these issues would get resolved by themselves
6633200 it is being directed against the west bengal government and the now defunct dghc dispensation under mr subash ghisingh these grievances are being used to cement the existing fissures within the once fragmented nepali community yet the deeper issues remain unaddressed
6633201 since the colonial times there was a conscious effort on the part of the administration to keep the nepali community segregated from the indian mainstream since independence some efforts have been made to rectify the situation but deep down it has not changed much

6633332 discussions are ongoing we have made some progress in the recent days on an agreement with the iraqis but there is no final agreement yet we will continue to have these discussions with the iraqis
6633333 so its not a treaty so it would not require senate ratification or anything like that
6633334 its very premature at this point to say that we have an agreement
6633335 a flying visit to baghdad by dr rice which drew a scathing reaction from the anti us cleric hojatoleslam moqtada al sadr he accused washington of trying to pressure the iraqi authorities to bend to its will

6633430 on the childs behalf for damages including costs of care to preserve and protect the life health and safety of the child punitive damages and costs and attorneys fees against a hospital health care facility or health care provider who harms or neglects the child or fails to provide medical care to the child after the childs birth
6633431 i can tell you the sponsors always wanted the entire package of bills which were introduced together and analyzed together
6633432 they never wanted them separated because they wanted to make sure that physicians would be chilled into not performing abortions for fear of going to jail
6633433 but when you take a definition comparable to the federal one and combine it with other provisions that attempt to give full personhood to a fetus that is pre viable and try to put fear of criminal and civil liability in the minds of physicians you have created a much different scenario
6633434 because they interfered negatively with the physician patient relationship attempted to dictate the practice of medicine for neonatal care and greatly expanded civil liability for physicians
6633435 they had sequential numbers but they were not in any way linked to call them a package is a tactic to try to reach out and grab issues in an attempt to divert attention from this one

6633459 the juvenile might not even know it at the time they may be trying to have a good time or they may be mad at somebody and burning something is a great way to get back at them

6633476 for their leadership role on their campuses it just seems like they didnt do enough homework to look at the science on this
6633477 im an alumnus of dickinson college and cant believe they signed on to this initiative
6633478 they are really just punting on the issue and leaving the high school principals to deal with it very disappointing
6633479 we want to encourage an honest and constructive dialogue among educators lawmakers parents and students
6633480 if what we are doing now doesnt work then we have an obligation to ourselves and to society to explore what might

6633553 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6633554 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6633555 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later

6633564 the government is not giving attention to this at all
6633565 its not paying attention to the real challenges the country is facing and terrorism is the most important challenge facing this nation
6633566 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6633567 theyre trying to dictate their terms to the government enforce their will on the government by saying you stop these operations

6633576 we wont relax our efforts to support and reconstruct afghanistan because we understand that what happens in afghanistan affects the rest of the world we are determined to work with the government and coalition forces to defeat the forces of terrorism
6633577 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6633578 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6633579 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year

6633582 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6633583 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6633584 the government is very careful as they are doing this as a restoration in light of their failure to lift the case in the supreme court
6633585 it is strange that this should be an object of judicial decision because it is premature

6633594 nato is trying to make a victim of an aggressor georgia and whitewash a criminal regime
6633595 the russian federation and the united states are not about to enter a new cold war even if tensions between moscow and washington rise dramatically
6633596 the cold war pitted an ideologically driven soviet union against the free world a conflict where both sides devoted enormous resources to defeat the other
6633597 an ideologically driven notion that the only possible choices these two countries have for relations are total conflict or total agreement neither of which is possible or desirable
6633598 we are stuck in relationships in which major powers are not enemies but not friends

6633603 if oil is cut to 60 a barrel russia is sunk russians spend less on research and development than poland they want bank accounts in the west to make millionaires off sales to europe they dont want a big war they want to gain influence and manipulate
6633604 able bodied guys to get the job done we have that we have young guys that are eager to learn the good thing is they are listening to the vets theyre listening to coach and going out there and trying to get better every day
6633605 if you look at yourself like that then you are only one dimensional and teams look at well he is just a pass rusher he cant hold up against the run so i think by adding weight just getting stronger in the weight room and getting acclimated to this game that i can be an every down defensive end
6633606 every year even when i wasnt on the jags team every year that was always the focus
6633607 we want to get our pass rush better not to say what we did last year wasnt good enough its just the fact that you always want more its a game of production last year our numbers werent where we wanted them to be the year before our numbers were high to have it drop off that throws up red flags and cause for concern

6633611 if you talk to ohioans throughout the state they are absolutely disgusted with what has been going on in the state of ohio in terms of the parade of incompetence and public corruption theyve said enough is enough they want somebody to come in whos going to clean it up
6633612 i will come in and clean up the mess left by mr dann in the attorney generals office
6633613 once that office is back on a firm footing once public confidence has been restored and theres integrity once again in the attorney generals office i intend to go back home thats not going to be in two years i fully envision thats going to be six years
6633614 i cant express it in words i really cant i have so many great memories of this fair as a teenager mom and dad would come and drop the four boys off and wed spend the evening here
6633615 i would come back when i was in high school if i had a date in the evening its just a rush a flood of great and wonderful memories that come back
6633616 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6633617 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6633618 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6633619 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6633620 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6633621 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria
6633622 gene upshaw did everything with great dignity pride and conviction
6633623 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the pro football hall of fame both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field
6633624 he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game
6633625 even though hes not here with us in body in his spirit we have the strength to go on
6633626 gene and i developed a close friendship that remained strong through the good times and some of the nfls most difficult challenges
6633627 his biggest asset was his understanding of the business of the game and you always knew that his concern for the games best interests guided his actions
6633628 few people in the history of the national football league have played the game as well as gene and then had another career in football with so much positive impact on the structure and competitiveness of the entire league as gene
6633629 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6633630 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture

6633635 its a tragic end to a programme that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into

6633637 this is a great opportunity for us to continue our growth strategy and serve the expanding needs of our clients
6633638 i dont really think people can understand what we went through
6633639 and i dont think we handled it any differently than anybody else would have
6633640 but hes also got to understand about protecting the football you hope that hell do a good job of making those kinds of decisions

6633650 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6633651 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6633652 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6633653 la inseguridad no se soluciona con un aumento del n mero de polic as y de soldados ni con amenazas de mano dura ni con leyes m s severas ni con penas m s largas tampoco con reuniones demag gicas como la de hoy del presidente pelele felipe calder n con los gobernadores y los titulares de las secretar as de seguridad p blica y de las procuradur as
6633654 calder n privilegia los asuntos que s lo arrojan privilegios a una minor a rapaz como las reformas a la seguridad social y la aprobaci n de nuevos impuestos que afectan a los peque os y medianos comerciantes y empresarios
6633655 pero todo es pura faramalla si en verdad quisiera el gobierno espurio enfrentar la crisis de seguridad deber a retirar de inmediato la iniciativa de reforma energ tica que es a todas luces privatizadora
6633656 el presidente pelele deber a otorgar apoyos a los j venes y garantizarles oportunidades de empleo y de educaci n as como entregar becas a aquellos que estudian el nivel medio superior
6633657 que obviamente no se plantear ni se abordar en la reuni n de este d a dijo calder n deber a solicitarle la renuncia a juan camilo mouri o porque la titularidad de la secretar a de gobernaci n que es la responsable de la conducci n de la pol tica interna no puede estar en manos de un delincuente confeso de la misma manera calder n tiene la obligaci n de separar de sus cargos al secretario de seguridad p blica federal genaro garc a luna y al procurador general de la rep blica eduardo medina mora porque ambos funcionarios ocuparon la direcci n de la agencia federal de investigaci n y del cisen en la administraci n foxista y desde ese entonces s lo han demostrado ser ineficientes y carecer de integridad
6633658 yo sostengo que el gobierno usurpador debe atender este asunto el de la inseguridad y de la violencia con seriedad porque nada m s se ha dedicado a la faramalla todo es pura propaganda y pura publicidad
6633659 pero siento que sacaron al ej rcito de sus cuarteles sin ninguna estrategia nada m s para hacer presencia porque no hay ning n plan
6633660 la situaci n de inseguridad que impera en todos los rincones de la naci n viene a confirmar que felipe calder n no existe que es un cero a la izquierda y que es un inepto
6633661 vamos a convocar a una movilizaci n nacional y si es necesario vamos a parar al pa s
6633662 the rewards are in your head the reward is invisible its what you like to do
6633663 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6633664 what we were doing was not figuring out how to build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6633665 our vet staff are confident that the recent bout of cold weather in wellington has not been a factor in her death
6633666 there were no outward signs she was not feeling well

6633669 what were going to do is build more features to the water park that are indoor for year round
6633670 it also will create a year round draw thatll help the other merchants of birch bay
6633671 the community has always been hopeful that the waterslides would stay so this is exciting
6633672 there are some houses that are going to be severely impacted by this
6633673 were grateful theyre here on one hand and were concerned on the other hand
6633674 they too believe that the last movie didnt break the mold and wound up in some kind of middle limbo
6633675 the white overalls are not a movement they are a tool which was
6633676 were wearing the white overall so that other people wear it were wearing the white overall so that we can take it off someday
6633677 can only be justified in situations of extreme state repression
6633678 the same people who are murdered slowly in the mechanized slaughterhouses of work are also arguing singing drinking dancing making love holding the streets picking up weapons and inventing a new poetry
6633679 i am not going to attempt to justify sabotage on any moral ground if the workers consider that sabotage is necessary that in itself makes sabotage moral its necessity is its excuse for existence and for us to discuss the morality of sabotage would be as absurd as to discuss the morality of the strike or the morality of the class struggle itself in order to understand sabotage or to accept it at all it is necessary to accept the concept of class struggle if you believe that between the workers on the one side and their employers on the other there is peace there is harmony such as exists between brothers and that consequently whatever strikes and lockouts occur are simply family squabbles if you believe that a point can be reached whereby the employer can get enough and the worker can get enough a point of amicable adjustment of industrial warfare and economic distribution then there is no justification and no explanation of sabotage intelligible to you
6633680 the whole system is obviously doomed but the worlds politicians dont think in terms of
6633681 if they can get you asking the wrong questions they dont have to worry about the answers
6633682 the name of the game is destroy all humans not screw around on the mothership
6633683 is essentially home detention it seems to be too extreme
6633684 im not quite sure what they mean by acts of civil disobedience but you dont have to be violent to cause disruption
6633685 it is clear that the effect and i hazard to say the intent of these conditions was to deprive these people of the right to speak freely about matters of politics clearly an element of their coming here to alice springs from distant places is to be involved in political expression
6633686 it is rare that i get a chance to stand up in court and address constitutional matters but this is one of those times
6633687 we want them to understand why we did what we did
6633688 this mob is a good mob this is okay with me
6633689 for the sake of these children here today but also for future generations
6633690 pine gap plays a vital role in us wartime operations
6633691 it has been used by the cia for political intervention in australia and it allows the us to spy on half the worlds population
6633692 pine gap is a prime target in the event of nuclear war it will be one of the first to go along with alice springs
6633693 information as to operations of the joint defence facility at pine gap except in so far as may be disclosed by the prosecution brief is not relevant to any issue in this case
6633694 so theyre allowed to give the information they want without us getting a chance to query that
6633695 are you aware how many of them were charged under this act
6633696 he said to me youd need a miracle to breach security at pine gap would you agree with that
6633697 the gentleman asked do you know what i want to use them for and i said yes to get into pine gap
6633698 he asked what chance i thought they had and i said none
6633699 any person presented with this information would be compelled to respond
6633700 i have lived here for thirty years and the only problem it has when people like you turn up
6633701 as an unrepresented defendant i think im allowed to quote from the castle
6633702 i think its the vibe that wasnt the vibe of this legislation at all
6633703 it would be better that this court be in error than this court be unfair
6633704 i dont believe i committed a crime what i did was an attempt to transform a military base into something open and honest
6633705 ive witnessed first hand the activities of pine gap and the result of what occurs there ive seen women and childrens bodies ripped to pieces and maimed
6633706 we felt we had a moral obligation as human beings we have a responsibility that rises above technical law
6633707 whats moral is not always legal and what is immoral is not always illegal if there is a minor law that has to be broken in the pursuit of moral faith then i will break it
6633708 between a suicide bomber and a jet fighter dropping bombs on civilians our action was calcluated to disrupt war fighting in the short term and bring about disarmament in the medium term
6633709 when i was preparing for the action in pine gap there were no abstract concepts about people far away they were about people that i know
6633710 when i prepared to do the incursion in pine gap i thought it was the least i could do given the magnitude of the crime i was trying to prevent i believe my actions were reasonable and proportionate
6633711 everything i had done before didnt disrupt the war process but going into pine gap did i was trying to fulfil the promise i had made to the people of iraq to do something to stop the war
6633712 i heard of the nuremberg principles and knew that it was my duty as a citizen of the world i had to act to stop it
6633713 no jury properly instructed should be asked to consider public policy
6633714 now in this court room there is blood on my boots blood of a human being that is there because of the targeting decisions made in pine gap
6633715 im asking you to honour the memory of this persons blood for the sake of the truth for the sake of your humanity im asking that you find me not guilty
6633716 the commonwealths hands are dripping with blood of the iraqi people
6633717 when peaceful protest doesnt work further action is required history shows this my faith demands this and my humanity requires it everything that i did that was lawful didnt work and then i went to pine gap for a few hours the coordinates didnt get relayed and the missiles didnt drop
6633718 this is a case that has evoked quite a great deal of emotion some of you may feel quite strongly that australia should have no part in the war in iraq you may feel that as members of the australian public we should know more about what is happening in pine gap having feelings of sympathy or empathy or perhaps prejudice is a normal human reaction however when it comes to deliberations in this matter i have to ask you to put aside your prejudices sympathy or empathy and use your intellect to examine the facts of the case
6633719 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
6633720 but sometimes you have that little piece that you might need in july or august and i just knew they werent going to get it
6633721 moreno wants to win hell tell everybody that hes very vocal about it he comes in here and tells me and tells everybody else that he wants to win to hear that from an owners mouth is awesome
6633722 when he made that decision to leave the twins he did it not just to benefit him financially
6633723 he wants to win hes a winner and he wants to get a championship that means a lot to him
6633724 i was in the wrong dugout i struck out and almost walked over to the home side just seeing different faces kind of makes you sad a little bit but as the season went on i felt a lot better im feeling comfortable and these guys have welcomed me in
6633725 he came to play every day guys like that are your leaders they play the game the way we like to see hard and with a smile we know theres changes and everything but that was a big hole created
6633726 i was one of the first ones to tell you that twins baseball once you learn how to play it you play it
6633727 and any time youve got an mvp morneau and a batting champion mauer over there they also put out great pitchers pretty good pitchers who throw strikes and know how to pitch they might be young but you give them time theyll be fine
6633728 you basically have to get better to stay the same but the whole mental thing is when you win you have a tendency to exhale and say aw we did it
6633729 i know youre pinched for space but how about listing all the free agents the kings have signed this summer to justify their off season ticket price increase

6633781 to reach the required 285 000 signatures is difficult enough but the final result shows that an extra 25 000 signatures have been attained this is evidence of just how strong the opposition to this law is

6633783 the rate of cyf notifications has sky rocketed yet actual cases of child abuse found are remaining the same and in some areas like the waikato actually falling
6633784 the anti smacking law has failed miserably you know a law is flawed when it fails to address the problem it was supposed to and implicates good families in the process supporters of the law are trying to herald its success because they incorrectly claim nobody has been prosecuted but we actually want a law that works and catches actual child abuse
6633785 the only reason the law was passed in the first place was because the two major parties were whipped to vote for it which is a little ironic in itself being an anti smacking law

6633793 honestly we doubted him last year but we got used to him he is growing on us and we hope for a good season with him this year
6633794 it will be hard to match last year but our guys will step up when we need to the best way to tell will be the first game with aledo and then a few games in on who is ready and who is not

6633810 this is probably the deepest team ive had since ive been here were two and three deep at alot of the spots and these kids have been playing for us for four straight years and theyve been part of playoff teams their expectations are alot higher than when we started
6633811 this group has been a part of the program since weve been winning for four straight years and hopefully this group will make it five their expectation level is to make the playoffs every year and then try to do something in the playoffs i think this group can do that
6633812 our quarterback situation is great for me as a coach because weve got three guys that have all had winning seasons at the lower levels they come up to the varsity level fighting for the spot and its just a joy knowing that you have three guys battling each other and im going to have a great quarterback each week going into games
6633813 at this point the quarterback position is still a battle ive got three guys that i have alot of trust in well watch them again on friday night and try to pick one of the three to lead this team this year
6633814 i think we have a pretty good football team i have alot of respect for triopia and routt had a great season last year we know each week going into it that were going to be tested and hopefully that helps us in the battle for a conference championship and hopefully push us far in the playoffs

6633864 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
6633865 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
6633866 in the case of pch the protein complex the so called trna splicing endonuclease is mutated this complex in involved in the manufacture of proteins in the human body and was identified in connection with a disease for the first time
6633867 the identification of mutations which cause pch2 and pch4 is an important step in the research of ponto cerebellar hypoplasia
6633868 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture
6633869 a better understanding of the sensory world of the child and the scientific basis for distaste and how to ameliorate it is a public health priority
6633870 the number one reason for non compliance among children when taking medicine or eating vegetables is that they dont like the taste
6633871 just look at a childs face when theyre eating some of these things
6633872 bitter taste is a sensation that evolved to make you not want to ingest something
6633873 it is interesting because it may suggest that children have heightened bitter sensitivity compared to adults
6633874 we find that the more a mother eats fruits when shes pregnant the more a child will accept fruits and vegetables
6633875 in england there is a lot of lemon flavor added to childrens medicine its a cultural phenomenon bubblegum and cherry are popular in the united states
6633876 it is one of the fundamental mysteries of human behavior why do we grow to like these foods and flavors that we initially rejected
6633877 isolated just one milligram a very tiny amount from natural sources that were very difficult to grow
6633878 we needed to develop a concise and efficient synthetic route to make enough largazole for animal studies

6633882 bob carr is very happy to talk the talk on climate change but when it comes to the walk its all backwards more polluting coal more money wasted on power stations we dont need our backwards march today is the latest in a series of protests demonstrating that the nsw community wont take this lying down
6633883 wasting electricity throws away money as well as causing greenhouse pollution nsw households can save 100 a year on their electricity bills by simply turning appliances off at the switch and thats only a start
6633884 policies to promote clean renewable energy like wind and solar would only mean a small additional cost to consumers and this could be offset many times over by savings from making our homes and businesses more energy efficient our state does not need more dirty coal power stations when we can have power without pollution
6633885 global warming is an imminent serious threat one that could have significant costs for nsw it will mean more frequent droughts especially in winter and more intense heavy rainstorms theres only one way to avoid this worrying bundle of problems cut greenhouse gas emissions
6633886 bob carr could bequeath nsw more dirty expensive climate changing coal or he could reduce energy bills greenhouse pollution and air pollution by stopping energy wastage and supporting clean renewable energy mr carr clean energy is the only way to go
6633887 people in nsw i think would like to have climate change dealt with
6633888 really what bob carr is concerned about now is getting re elected than dealing with climate change and that is extremely disappointing
6633889 our state does not need more dirty coal power stations when we can have power without pollution

6634102 tu diab lica hija y su vacuo amante generan unos u s 40 millones cada a o en pel culas violentas y psic patas y regalan s lo tres a ni os hambrientos tratan de aparentar que les importa la humanidad mientras cr an ni os tontos que le har n m s da o al mundo
6634103 ha dicho que le gusta el candidato republicano john mccain pero a n no decidi a qui n votar no se supone que es brillante
6634104 public figures like michael phelps exert a major influence over our youngsters
6634105 mr phelps is a superior athlete by any measure but his judgment regarding the mcdonalds and kelloggs frosted flakes endorsements was either 1 ill advised by his handlers 2 the irrational product of too much blood sugar or 3 a sad triumph of greed over good ciof believes that celebrities should think twice before choosing to endorse or encourage the consumption of any product which is inherently unhealthful to children especially if that product is correlated to obesity diabetes and a myriad of dangerous conditions
6634106 octagon sports agent peter carlisle is making a strategic branding mistake by aligning michael phelps to kelloggs frosted flakes and mcdonalds in this era of escalating child obesity and diabetes the last association michael phelps wants is that of junk food pusher
6634107 while michael phelps may consume thousands of calories a day and burn them off through olympic training americas kids arent so fat sickly and have little hope of accomplishing a single sit up much less olympic gold kids are watching and michael phelps going for the quick cash of pushing junk food at the expense of children tarnishes his image similar to an association with cigarettes or alcohol would national action against obesity and the childrens international obesity foundation implore michael phelps and all celebrities and athletes to reject offers to push more sugar fat and hazardous calories onto americas kids
6634108 as we set out to look at the causes of obesity in our film
6634109 this is unconscionable and we hope that michael phelps reconsiders his endorsement contracts
6634110 because children under five deserve environments full of healthy options not marketing venues for junk food producers
6634111 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6634112 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6634113 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6634114 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6634115 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6634116 usa gymnastics has always believed this issue needed to be addressed by the fig and ioc an investigation would help bring closure to the issue and remove any cloud of speculation from this competition
6634117 longe de mim ser politicamente correto mas isso n o seria ofensivo

6634122 brethren even if a man caught in any trespass you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness each one looking to yourself lest you too be tempted bear one anothers burdens and thus fulfill the law of christ for if anyone thinks he is something when he is nothing he deceives himself but let each one examine his own work and then he will have reason for boasting in regard to himself alone and not in regard to another for each one shall bear his own load
6634123 sejak awal pemerintah menyadari adanya permasalahn disparitas pembangunan daerah di negara kita di mana masih terdapat daerah daerah yang relatif tertinggal daripada daerah lainnya
6634124 dengan demikian percepatan pembangunan daerah tertinggal pada hakekatnya merupakan upaya untuk mengurangi kemiskinan
6634125 dengan kenaikan anggaran ini insya allah mimpi di setiap sekolah ada komputer untuk siswa dan guru bisa menjadi kenyataan
6634126 kondisi ini jauh lebih baik jika dibandingkan dengan keadaan pada tahun 2004 yang baru menjangkau 62 persen dari ibukota kecamatan di tanah air
6634127 in and of itself a breath of relief for many players who were wanting that kind of unabashed magic in the game and a cause for stomach churning for people who are really into the lore that think were going to suddenly turn it into flying wizards and stuff like that
6634128 ini adalah wujud dari etika pemerintahan yang perlu kita junjung tinggi demi menjamin kelancaran pelayanan masyarakat dan terpenuhinya kepentingan rakyat secara keseluruhan
6634129 tanpa etika persaingan politik tidak akan berjalan secara sehat bahkan dapat merusak sendi sendi kenegaraan dan kebangsaan kita
6634130 kita berharap perluasan partisipasi politik ini pada akhirnya dapat meningkatkan kualitas kepemimpinan pemerintahan di daerah
6634131 perbaikan mekanisme pelaksanaan pilkada terus dilakukan termasuk evaluasi yang menyeluruh terhadap berbagai kelemahan selama pelaksanaan pilkada pada tahun tahun sebelumnya sebagai salah satu upaya penting kita mempersiapkan pelaksanaan pemilu 2009
6634132 ini merupakan capaian sejarah yang fundamental dalam kehidupan berbangsa kita dan yang penting dicatat kita semua berhasil melakukannya secara efektif efisien damai dan tertib tanpa menimbulkan gejolak yang berarti
6634133 kita harus memastikan bahwa anggaran yang semakin besar tidak diikuti dengan semakin meningkatnya penyimpangan mismanagement salah kelola apalagi korupsi di daerah
6634134 anggaran untuk daerah memang harus mengikuti fungsi dan tanggung jawab semakin besar tanggung jawab diserahkan ke daerah maka semakin besar anggaran yang ikut didesentralisasikan
6634135 daerah lah yang berada di paling depan untuk peningkatan kemakmuran rakyat anggaran yang makin besar ke daerah sudah seharusnya diikuti oleh kompetensi dan tanggung jawab penuh untuk mengelola secara baik dan transparan bagi kemakmuran dan kesejahteraan rakyatnya
6634136 marilah mengemban amanah dan tanggung jawab dengan baik sehingga meninggalkan nama yang baik pula nama yang akan dikenang oleh rakyat jauh setelah kita meninggalkan jabatan yang kita emban
6634137 penularan secara global wabah flu unggas h5n1 ini menyebabkan organisasi kesehatan dunia menunjukkan keprihatinan mendalamnya menyangkut kemungkinan penyebaran virus tersebut dari manusia ke manusia di masa depan
6634138 lagi pula perkembangan kekebalan terhadap dua obat anti influenza yang disetujui oseltamivir tamiflu r dan zanamivir relenza r dan juga kurangnya vaksin yang memadai telah meningkatkan perlunya mengembangkan obat obat anti virus baru
6634139 karenanya saya ingin dilibatkan dalam tahap penelitian praklinis calon obat anti virus inovatif ini dan berharap melanjutkan kerjasama sukses kami dengan canopus biopharma di bidang ini
6634140 dosis statin yang lebih tinggi dari dosis yang digunakan dalam kajian ini kemungkinan dapat menghasilkan kemanjuran yang jauh lebih besar statc tm tampaknya juga lebih efektif apabila diberikan dalam upaya pencegahan
6634141 kami juga termotivasi dalam membandingkan potensi senyawa ini dengan obat obat anti influenza lain yang tersedia saat ini jelas terdapat kebutuhan signifikan di seluruh dunia akan alternatif yang unggul murah dan melimpah dalam upaya memerangi influenza
6634142 kita patut bersyukur bahwa pendapatan per kapita meningkat dari tahun ke tahun pada tahun 2004 pendapatan per kapita baru mencapai 1 186 dolar as namun pada 2007 telah menjadi 1 946 dolar as atau meningkat dengan 64 persen dalam tiga tahun
6634143 kemajuan kemajuan ini tentu membangkitkan semangat kita untuk terus melangkah maju untuk masa depan yang lebih baik
6634144 pemerintah spanyol mengutuk keras dua serangan bunuhdiri di kota wah pakistan yang menyebabkan lebih dari 50 korban tewas dan puluhan lainnya cedera
6634145 saat ini mengisi bahan bantuan kemanusiaan di markasnya di pelabuhan gaeta italia dan akan menuju georgia
6634146 kapal kapal itu akan mengangkut ribuan selimut bahan obat obatan dan makanan bayi
6634147 tuntutan pemekaran yang sama sekali tidak memiliki urgensi tidak memenuhi persyaratan dan tidak memberikan manfaat nyata bagi rakyat di daerah harus kita tolak secara tegas
6634148 dengan demikian jumlah daerah otonom yang ada berjumlah 510 daerah otonom yang terdiri atas 33 provinsi 386 kabupaten serta 91 kota
6634149 karena pemekaran daerah seharusnya didasari pada semangat untuk meningkatkan efektivitas pemerintahan daerah serta untuk meningkatkan kesejahteraan dan pelayanan umum sebaliknya pemekaran daerah tanpa tujuan yang benar dan tidak dikelola dengan baik justru akan menyengsarakan rakyat dan menjadi beban keuangan negara
6634150 evaluasi ini akan memberi kesempatan kepada kita untuk melakukan konsolidasi terhadap daerah daerah otonom baru serta daerah daerah induk yang dimekarkan baik dari segi tata pemerintahan kapasitas birokrasi maupun pengelolaan keuangan daerahnya evaluasi ini juga kita lakukan sebagai dasar pertimbangan dalam pengambilan keputusan bagi penghapusan dan penggabungan daerah jika diperlukan
6634151 dengan peraturan pemerintah ini kebijakan pemekaran daerah dapat dilakukan lebih selektif dan hati hati kita perlu lebih cermat dan arif dalam merespons berbagai pemikiran dan tuntutan untuk pemekaran daerah yang baru
6634152 di era reformasi ini tak ada lagi satu cabang kekuasaan atau satu lapisan pemerintahan yang menguasai kekuasaan dan kewenangan secara monolitik atau sentralistik
6634153 bahkan kita juga melakukan desentralisasi politik agar masyarakat di daerah bisa mengatur urusan pemerintahannya sendiri dan memilih kepala daerahnya secara demokratis tangung jawab mengelola kewenangan dan keuangan ini diarahkan untuk sebesar besarnya kemakmuran rakyat bukan untuk sebesar besarnya kemakmuran penyelenggara pemerintahan daerah
6634154 kesan saya persoalan yang disampaikan itu banyak yang menjadi kewenangan dan tanggung jawab pemerintah daerah untuk mengatasinya
6634155 sebagaimana perintah panglima tertinggi pasukan angkatan bersenjata jum at 22 agustus pukul 06 00 waktu setempat semua pasukan rusia akan mulai ditarik dari wilayah georgia ke ossetia selatan

6634253 teasers are usually rich kids with nothing to do they cruise around looking for planets that havent made interstellar contact yet and buzz them
6634254 they buzz them they find some isolated spot with very few people around then land right by some poor unsuspecting soul whom no ones ever going to believe and then strut up and down in front of him wearing silly antennas on their head and making

6634319 they call him loose cannon i heard but that talent he has is unbelievable speed arm and hes going to hit hes 22 years old i remember when i was 22 23 i was still learning how to hit i definitely think if you be patient with him hes smart enough to go out there and learn as much as he can i think hes going to be a big impact in the organization
6634320 i want them to make it to the postseason because i have a lot of respect for the organization i want those guys to make it there and go on
6634321 these athletes can speak to the young people in our more troubled communities especially since many of them come from those communities
6634322 nakaka inspire siyang tao lalo na sa mga baguhan na katulad ko kung titingnan mo na lang ang body of work niya as an actor mapapa wow ka na lang kasi sa tinagal niya sa industriya hindi mo alam kung mararating mo rin yon plus all the achievements
6634323 im just overwhelmed na he said yes to be part of our movie and weve been so close ever since makuwento rin kasi si tito ipe and i love to listen to all his stories doon ka matuto sa mga kuwento niya
6634324 if its not too much to ask i would love to work with tito ipe again at sana sa mas mabigat na drama movie naman i gained so much experience working with him may isang scene nga kami sa movie na sobrang drama and i was able to pull it off dahil nandoon siya
6634325 i know my mom sharon cuneta is very happy kasi nga hindi pa niya nakakasama si tito ipe sa movie naunahan ko pa siya and its my first movie pa kaya very memorable sa akin ito lahat
6634326 i wish that he continues to be generous in sharing his experiences as an actor hes one of the best actors in our country and he deserves the respect that hes getting right now i am looking forward to work with tito ipe again at sana mangyari yon soon
6634327 okey sa akin kasi yun din ang itinutulak kong advocacy education talaga
6634328 parang nag coincide lahat ang schedules yun nga lang ang nangyari kung busy kami mas busy talaga siya dingdong dahil wala nga rito
6634329 ako si ronnie sa una kang naging akin bago siyang role bale additional siya sa original kasama ko sina maxene magalona angelika dela cruz wendell ramos at si lj reyes
6634330 never pa kaming nag partner ni lj kung meron man siguro guesting na isa or dalawa pero yung series wala talaga never rin kaming naging love team so kumbaga ngayon pa lang talaga
6634331 okey naman ako under exclusive contract naman tayo ng gma at pinagkakatiwalaan naman natin ang mga boss ng gma so kung anong role ang ibigay nila sa akin ginagawa ko with the best that i can at saka kami hindi naman kami magkaaway ni lj magkaibigan kami maganda naman yung breakup namin
6634332 maganda siguro kasi maganda ang breakup namin even after the breakup na retain namin yung friendship namin
6634333 okey naman enjoy naman ako na ganito besides meron akong tatlong shows sa gma so siguro dapat lang naman na magpasalamat ako sa diyos at galingan ko sa bawat projects na ginagawa ko siguro hindi ko muna priority sa ngayon ang maggugol ng panahon sa lovelife
6634334 siguro i could say exclusively dating pero ang maganda kasi ngayon non showbiz so wala masyadong intriga
6634335 actually two years ago pa po ang concept na ito si roselle monteverde gustong gumawa ng project tungkol sa call centers they wanted it na packed na ang buong istorya tapos two years ago nag soap opera muna ako sa abs cbn until hindi natuloy until nga after two year sa wakas nagawa na
6634336 actually hindi naman kami kinakabahan pero yung kissing scene namin maraming eksena maraming tao so parang wow tapos sinasabi nila na o sige na kiss na doon ako nahiya kasi tawa ako nang tawa kaya after nun tumatawa na lang kami ni john
6634337 ang pinakamagandang experience lang dito i was given the chance to work with gma 7 stars kasi kapamilya network ako masayang masaya ako kasi tinanggap ko ang trabahong ito at nakatrabaho ko sila
6634338 sobrang natulungan niya talaga ako nailabas ko talaga lahat ng kailangan niya ilabas imo motivate ka talaga niya sobrang perfectionist at saka ang galing kasi sobrang inaalalayan nya ang lahat
6634339 sa dubbing nandoon siya talaga talagang tutok talaga siya pati yung acting pagdating doon sa dubbing ang dami ko natutunan at saka yung ano yung pag internalize sayo sa eksena mo
6634340 feeling namin si direk doon parang direktor namin sa gma parang ganun yung porma niya sa akin hindi nya kami pinabayaan kahit na may network sya may ibang network kami and na feel namin na mahal nya kami
6634341 because shes a mother not only to her family but also to her constituents also her program in lipa is very much aligned to the campaign of bear brand number three because shes very credible at alam naming shell be a very powerful spokesperson for the brand
6634342 walang political agenda ito whether tatakbo ako o hindi this has nothing to do with the 2010 campaign wala sa isip ko ang sinasabi nilang pagtakbo kong vice president ang focus ko ay ang malnutrition problem sa batangas iniisip ko lang ang makatulong i want to help and i want to make a difference
6634343 in anything i do hindi ko puwedeng sabihin na its a prestige for me na from a governor i will be the vice president hindi po ang focus ko ano yung puwede kong gawin batangas lang wala akong interes sa national positions hindi ko pa kaya
6634344 tsismis lang yung planong pagtakbo kong vice president or president forget it theres no plan and i believe in destiny wala sa plano ko yun gusto ko lang muna talagang makatulong nakakaalarma na sa mga bata malnutrition ang problema pero sa adult obesity
6634345 before end of the year magsu shooting na kami wala pang title pinag uusapan na si john lloyd pa lang ang alam kong kasama ang ibang cast hindi ko pa alam ito yung di natuloy last year matutuloy na rin sa wakas first ito sa three movie commitments ko sa star cinema may movie rin ako with luis manzano and sharon cuneta
6634346 i find angel very very nice masaya sila and im happy for my son period no comma
6634347 huwag muna ayoko pang maging lola my sons enjoying his life maawa kayo hes only 27 right now i know hes very very happy at bilang ina masaya ako if hes happy kung kailan siya ready open ako at alam kong up to this day wala kaming inililihim sa isat isa were very comfortable sa mother and son relationship namin
6634348 nakikita ninyo ang galaw nila at may mga estrelya ang mga mata nila ano pa ba ang aaminin nila basta ako masaya ako sa anak ko
6634349 lagi nilang sinasabing masaya sila and i understand may mga bagay bagay na hindi puwedeng sabihin alam ni luis kung saan ilalagay ang sarili pero ayaw niyang mag deny
6634350 this is the result of two years of real hard work
6634351 i was just trying to take the gate and come out first i just raced my race and it came out for the best
6634352 we are not looking at the match in that sort of way
6634353 this argentine team has committed themselves to each match at the olympics in order to win the gold medal
6634354 to defend against lionel messi is the biggest thing we have to do
6634355 we just have to make sure we stay close to him and we dont give him the chances like we did the last time in the under 20 world cup
6634356 i believe in my team and they believe in themselves as you can see with the performance so far in the olympics
6634357 i felt good all day everything kind of was clicking i had a great start i was just a little outside of maris but silver im psyched
6634358 how is that talk about stuff flying all over the track everywhere

6634361 im so glad i can represent and be a part of it mikey and donny and me its huge for american bmx think about it thisll bring a big boost to our program it puts us on the map again
6634362 we can finally close the book on this and raul can rest in peace
6634363 were very disappointed by the verdict and believe we have a number of good issues on appeal
6634364 this guy right here irrevocably changed so many lives when he chose to arm himself that night
6634365 raul briseno had too much pride to give in to a couple of punks and he chased them out and he paid for it with his life
6634366 the suggestion that no blood transferred onto that jacket and mr houghtaling was so confident that no blood transferred onto it that he wore it into the police station is totally incredible
6634367 the man as i think we all saw is crazy
6634368 thats the crux of the states case and theres nothing there
6634369 he had no motivation to implicate himself in the crime yet he gave specific details

6634389 apocrypha that is books which are not regarded as equal to the holy scriputres and yet are profitable and good to read
6634390 as to the apocriphe bookes i omit them because i am no papist as i said before
6634391 as the church reads the books of judith and tobit and maccabees but does not receive them among the canonical scriptures so also it reads wisdom and ecclesiasticus for the edification of the people not for the authoritative confirmation of doctrine
6634392 that sounds a bit steep what can i get for a rib

6634467 not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
6634468 the pain of consummation soon melted away muhammad was so gentle i hardly felt the scorpions sting to be in his arms skin to skin was the bliss i had longed for all my life
6634469 this detail was in response to complaints from citizens about homosexual activity that has been taking place at one of the communitys most scenic sites
6634470 to date what had been announced publicly doesnt appear in reality to be happening and a number of questions are being asked
6634471 they saw improvement in their sleep pattern a reduction in joint pains which many of them thought were due to just the ageing process an improvement in sexuality and lastly if they still had hot flushes and night sweats they of course improved
6634472 she needs to get accurate information about the risks because theyve often been inflated and exaggerated by the people not working in this area or indeed by people with vested interests
6634473 that corresponds to about eight extra cancers per 10 000 women now per year that may not seem like a lot but over a womans lifetime that does add up
6634474 if theres a population who deserves hormone replacement therapy its women going through the menopausal change who are experiencing significant symptoms
6634475 and what this says to us is theres clear evidence that theyll gain benefit
6634476 loves a fools dance i aint got much sense but i still got my feet

6634478 like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike
6634479 will also stop next years profits from looking seriously underwhelming after the phenomenal success of the dark knight

6634482 atribuir el accidente a la situaci n de la compa a es una barbaridad
6634483 si no pasa nada y decimos que va a pasar nos acusan de alarmistas
6634484 contratar a terceros el mantenimiento como proponen es un atraso
6634485 me pidieron que llevase a madrid el avi n con los familiares
6634486 no dec an nada y ya llevaban horas de incertidumbre y yo no sab a nada
6634487 when i got there i found a couple of vehicles on the side of the highway and i said we definitely have something going on
6634488 i called my street supervisor we didnt have any additional deputies so he and i went in in his expedition
6634489 as we drove up everyone scattered there were probably 125 people there and 60 70 vehicles everyone left that left myself my lieutenant a bonfire a
6634490 i made that decision myself after everyone had left the area to send a strong message and we did we put a round through that
6634491 my whole goal there was i hope that whoever it was that went out and rented that beer keg and gave it to our children when they turned it back in a complaint would be filed about that
6634492 the coward never never revealed himself never turned in any information whatsoever
6634493 you can question these methods if you want but we sent a strong message we are not putting up with alcohol in our juveniles
6634494 i exercised executive privilege as the sheriff not to write a report
6634495 i knew what happened ladies and gentlemen i knew what my goals were no i didnt write a report and no i didnt follow that procedure because as the sheriff i chose to exercise that option
6634496 i stand fully accountable for my actions and again sending a strong message to the parents out there that we need your help in helping our kids to stay out of trouble and not get involved in alcohol and drugs
6634497 i stand by my decision today and i think that is so penny ante of this opponent to draw on something like that that would affect the safety of our children
6634498 jeff hardy had nothing to do with it it came from the naacp
6634499 they also wanted the question about beck auto group asked we wanted it to be fair
6634500 i have two commanders who worked for him at the pcso sitting in this room right now that would tell you if one of their officers fired an m 16 into a
6634501 it starts at the top your leadership starts at the top my philosophies my beliefs will not be reckless
6634502 this is not 1950 this is not walking tall this is 2008 lets bring professionalism back to the organization
6634503 in 2005 i competitively bid for a vehicle when i was with the school district i went to ford and i went to mr beck guess who got it ford because they came in 2 000 less
6634504 there will be a blue ribbon panel and civilians will sit in on it it will be open to the public and the lowest bid will get our money
6634505 i dont think i can work the entire county by myself
6634506 i think that would be absolutely immoral unethical we have a lot of command staff here today ive worked with a lot of them they are good people
6634507 these employees are safe you cant just go in there and fire these people
6634508 there are a lot of smart people that are willing to go to work no matter who their sheriff is there are people at that agency who have already told me they wont give me the chance thats their problem if they dont want to give me an opportunity then i am sorry
6634509 will i put people around me that i know are competent enough and will reduce crime in our county and will deploy our resources and put officers back out into the community serving the public absolutely
6634510 if he picks hillary he gets her 18million supporters and we would win in a cakewalk and control the white house for 16 years
6634511 barack obama is no different only its your money he wants to spend obamas got plans big plans for your money
6634512 the choice is simple barack obama will give a real tax cut up to us1000 to 95 per cent of working americans while john mccain will follow in bushs footsteps adding to the deficit with huge tax breaks for oilcompanies and other special interests
6634513 there is no doubt the campaign to discredit obama is paying off for mccain right now
6634514 an er visit for something thats not an emergency costs the medical center 1 200
6634515 thats sucking up dollars in health care that we dont all have to just blow through carelessly
6634516 michelle inspired us to step back and take a holistic approach to this problem
6634517 patients need a source of ongoing care and this initiative is trying to make that care available in a more appropriate setting and in a more timely way

6634519 the review committee found weaknesses in the management and oversight of the equity finance business within anzs securities lending unit
6634520 taken together this meant that anz did not adequately identify and manage the range of risks that arose from the operation of a business of this nature
6634521 the gravity of the issues relating to the equity finance business should have been but were not properly bought to the attention of the chief executive or the board
6634522 this plan will provide anz with a step change in the management of risk particularly in institutional and will draw a line in the sand at anz about performance and accountability in the future
6634523 a prime example of how quality control went down the drain the vue made gm leave the building
6634524 if this was gloom and doom we wouldnt be doing it
6634525 were growing up and we all have such huge dreams we want to fulfill
6634526 but one of the biggest messages we have is you support your friends whatever they want to do
6634527 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
6634528 the medias images of them are smelly and vile and i must always attack the medias representation of what is good or cool
6634529 it says im naked in the middle of a magazine
6634530 remember girls the eyes are the nipples of the face

6634532 the perception of the government of iraq is that this is a 10 foot enemy giant but it really is not now
6634533 business operators perception on the investment climate in thailand significantly dropped in 2007
6634534 ive never had a problem with anything like that so its a shock to hear that anything like that happened
6634535 its hard to hear about that because i have never heard of such a thing

6634537 we need to relieve the burden on the va from routine health care
6634538 if you have a routine health care need take it wherever you want whatever doctor or health care provider and get the treatment you need while we at the va focus our attention our care our love on these grievous wounds of war
6634539 received consistently better care across the board including screening diagnosis treatment and follow up
6634540 ideologues like john mccain and george bush hate the fact that the va exists
6634541 they hate the fact that theres a functional example out there of the government providing better care at a lower cost than the private sector
6634542 the problem that the va faces now is that the bush administration failed to hire enough doctors and disability claims adjusters when they chose to go to war with iraq if these doctors had been hired the va would be an example of the government doing good work bush and mccain dont want the public to see that
6634543 if im driving a humvee in iraq and a roadside bomb explodes and i veer off the road and crush my arm and end up losing it and needing a prosthetic is that a combat wound according to sen mccain
6634544 and i heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts and i looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him

6634574 a city that hands its police force a license to trash the constitutional rights of its citizens is not a city that is upholding law and order and protecting its citizens on the contrary unlimited police power is a complete breakdown of the law
6634575 these interrogations and checkpoints are comparable to police practices in authoritarian regimes and especially apartheid era south africa which is even more ominous given the fact the residents of these new red zones are mostly african american and poor
6634576 such measures also recall the repression by police and private security firms in post katrina new orleans which accompanied the obstruction and expulsion of mostly poor and black residents from their homes
6634577 these policies have only empowered criminal gangs involved in the drug trade just as prohibition fed the growth of organized crime the aclu is right two of our most important freedoms the right of mobility and protection against warrantless search and seizure are being nullified for the sake of the disastrous war on drugs in violation of local law and the us constitution
6634578 democratic and republican politicians are equally responsible for the transformation of civilian police into militias

6634636 we have always maintained that sport like any other social and cultural activity should always evolve and adapt to human diversity because its a question of how to encourage people to fully participate and still accommodate religious beliefs as long as whatever they want to do doesnt pose a threat to their own safety or the safety of others

6634669 we stayed four hours without reinforcements we had no more ammunition to defend ourselves with any weapons besides our famas assault rifles

6634674 participation in the afghan occupation has been supported by nearly all political forces and has never been put in question in principle however the methods employed in this policy have been discussed paris has demanded a revision of nato strategy whose failure is evident it is time to redefine the alliances objectives and its means of action the president must explain to france why its soldiers are dying 6 000 kilometers from its territory
6634675 didnt want to talk to the president or the politicians
6634676 the army changed him the last few months he was more tense than usual as if he were being hunted even when he slept soldiers inevitably no longer are men they become weapons he only thought about the army he passed the tests without conviction but when he was admitted to the parachutists he was so proud that he wanted to go on
6634677 the withdrawal is not happening very quickly if it in fact has begun the withdrawal needs to take place and needs to take place now
6634678 russia is in violation of the commitments they have made
6634679 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6634680 when you threaten poland you perhaps forget that it is not 1988 its 2008 and the united states has a firm treaty guarantee to defend polands territory as if it was the territory of the united states so its probably not wise to throw these threats around
6634681 and we must not rest until that war is won

6634686 where government officials had recently said three local women were raped and murdered at least eight residents said tuesday that no such attacks had occurred
6634687 if the government is destabilised by the results of these elections the successes already gained at the war front will be at risk
6634688 military morale is now at its peak due to the backing it receives from the government at the war front and the dedication of the military hierarchy
6634689 when i the military was entering the ltte held mulathivu district the trade unions went on strike and when i was entering the ltte stronghold of kilinochchi students tried to barge in to my residence temple trees these are political coups against the government
6634690 the best thing that can happen in the current situation is for me to take control of the ncp i think it would be advantageous to the government also to have someone like me assuming provincial high office that way the government would be free to conduct the war effort i will know how to look after the region and the population
6634691 the government has put most of its eggs into the war basket and it will not be long before the country knows whether the voters of the two provinces find the omelet tasty
6634692 there is no point pretending that what is happening is not happening in the world economy that this unique combination of higher food and energy prices on the one hand and a sharp dislocation in the financial sector on the other is going to do anything other than make the next year a painful adjustment for the uk economy

6634699 embracing commitments from pacific partners to improve governance and increase investment in economic infrastructure
6634700 special measures in relation to fiji consistent with paragraph 2 iv of the biketawa declaration

6634705 tough foreign policy that is neither republican nor democratic but is a strong smart american foreign policy to make our country more secure and advance our interests in the world
6634706 and john mccain should endorse president bushs efforts to oppose russias actions and form a bipartisan stand on this issue it is unfortunate that some of the candidates supporters are engaging in pointless criticism of each others public statements on the georgia crisis

6634710 in georgia and russia a perfect brew for a blowup
6634711 united states and its nato allies impose a price on russia

6634713 to respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
6634714 immediately and unconditionally cease its military operations and withdraw all forces from sovereign georgian territory
6634715 the details of who did what to precipitate russias war against georgia are not very important

6634768 still upset over the appointment of henry morgentaler to the order of canada a coalition of anti abortion groups has filed a complaint with the canadian judicial council cjc accusing chief justice beverley mclachlin of misconduct for her part in chairing the order of canada advisory council it is a frivolous accusation and one that the chief justice should not have to answer at all much less publicly those who oppose abortion or seek restrictions to protect the lives of fetuses take the decision to honour dr morgentaler as an affront to disagree with his appointment is reasonable abortion remains a polarizing issue but complaints about the outcome should be made to the governor general who awards the order of canada not to the cjc to attack the process by which dr morgentaler was appointed to the order of canada is also open to the canadian family action coalition the group can do so by challenging the constitution of the order of canada which obliges the chief justice to act as the chair of the advisory council to the order of canada accusing the chief justice of judicial misconduct however suggests these activists are merely looking for publicity
6634769 if the canadian family action coalition is concerned about the constitutionality of the provision under the constitution of the order of canada requiring the chief justice to chair the advisory council the group should challenge the requirements of the law this complaint to the cjc about the chief justices alleged misconduct is a cheap shot and unconvincing

6634877 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged

6634897 david tam mcfly born march 1 1987 he was a middle to low class man with a natural knack in the field of mechanical engineering dimension optics chronography and temporal displacement david had a special ability with coming up with ideas on the go and made many theoretical inventions one in which was fully constructed and built many times skynet sent back in time a terminator to capture david at an unknown amount of months years before judgment day where they locked david in a factory bunker for the next 20 years he was held captive by the terminators thereafter in 2027 he was forced to create a device which would aid skynet in the battle against the resistance the time displacement chamber after the final construction of the machine he was saved by john connor along with his tech com unit the day the resistance destroyed skynets main complex john connor was then forced to send kyle reese back in time to protect sarah connor from a skynet attack thus being one of the reasons why derek has such a hate for david mcfly if it wasnt for david kyle wouldnt have had to go back in time david mcfly was very remorseful over the machine that he created for skynet so he worked for the resistance with us in the future where john connor was aided by david mcfly in creating the time displacement chamber again for the resistance to stop skynet mcflys suggested a plan to john connor as a secondary objective to undo what david mcfly himself had done in the past currently i have three optional objectives that were programed by john connor himself just in case we occurred upon david in the past objective one is to protect david since we altered the future and caused david to meet us early we need to have him make a time machine now in the present and directly send him to the future where he will automatically help future john connor work on the creation of his time machine thus delaying skynet in the creation of its own time machine forcing skynet to make the time displacement machine on its own as of right now we have not yet prevented skynet so this is the possible result mission option number two if we prevent skynet by destroying the turk we send him to the future where he will be able to live in the peaceful future that we created with out skynet either way he must be sent to the future now but if all else fails my last optional objective is to have him terminated so that he cant aid skynet in the creation of the time machine as of right now i have been programed by john to provide the blue prints and schematics to the creation of davids time displacement device we must get to work on it now since we have limited time we only can make a device that will travel one person through time so after the machine is used it will be useless and most likely implode on itself just like what happened in the bank vault
6634898 hey you guys untie me please i want to help i want to make this right i dont even need the blue prints i can make it right here right now from my head i just need a few things and we can get it working now dont just tie me up here and expect me not to act because i need to whats right for to long ive wondered who i am and why im here and now this is my chance to make it right before it all goes wrong
6634899 cameron untie him hes not going to go anywhere david knows whats needed of him
6634900 dont mess with it or you will get an infection you shouldnt feel much pain now that i gave you anesthetic
6634901 im sure he will do whats right cameron knows he will or shes going to kill him remember
6634902 thats him i swear thats him he is guy who made it he is the one that john connor in the future was talking about david something david mcfly
6634903 affirmative he must not be killed he is one part of our secondary mission
6634904 ill do it i kill that son of a right now he is the reason why my brothers dead
6634905 no no not this time i said im not going to let another person die because of skynet not anymore no not again like the others
6634906 but he is the main designer that makes the system
6634907 he needs to live he is most likely not the one who planted the bomb we need him he can help in the future
6634908 what are you talking about crud if you guys wont kill him i will
6634909 it is standard procedure as we need to ascertain whether they were directly involved in the attack or not and the rest is up to the deputy public prosecutors office to decide
6634910 we took them into custody as we have clear images of them in both photographs and a video recording
6634911 so how do i help john in the future again
6634912 you helped john connor created the time displacement chamber in 2027 so that he could send back both me and the other resistance fighters to the past to undo the future of skynet which also included protecting sarah and john connor from skynet attacks
6634913 ok and what about this terminator you said that captured me in 2011
6634914 it was a one of a kind infiltrator it was made for one time use and then its memory chip was destroyed and body incinerated you said in the future that it was watching you for a long time before it appeared one day and took you to a fallout shelter where we all will be made you kept on saying that it was strange because when you first saw it it was almost like you were very friendly to it
6634915 she means that you were fooled by a robot david a robot that you probably recognized as one of your friends or family most likely believe me i would know
6634916 one of a kind meaning that there was only one of them that ever had an appearance and look as that i mean its lame personality probably convinced you it was real
6634917 hey mr reese do you like base ball by any chance
6634918 did you and your brother ever play baseball in the park
6634919 oh with all this time travel going on i thought that you might have a younger version of yourself running around never mind
6634920 kid with questioning like that your going to get yourself killed seriously
6634921 you need to be done by tomorrow morning david are we clear david
6634922 im just double checking all the circuits right now i dont want to end up in jurassic park if you know what i mean
6634923 i have the location and date david depending how we do after you leave will depend on what future you will have and whether or not skynet is in your future you will arrive in a bunker where john is waiting for you to get to work if you go to the future in which we prevent skynet
6634924 if we are successful you will arrive in a populated planet with people and no desolation if you end up in this future find us and your family im sure they will be glad to see you
6634925 alright alright alright give me the date and coordinates already
6634926 so your going to be the leader of the future resistance
6634927 according to moores law skynet is our future but i really just dont know how im going to be this hero people talk about im trying
6634928 guess having the burden of the future world on your shoulders could be cumbersome huh you really think this all can be prevented
6634929 yeah i hope so i keep telling myself that it can be done
6634930 when i heard you mumbling earlier when i was double checking the machine
6634931 its something my mother says a lot its sort of her little sentimental saying she has and its slowly rubbing off on me
6634932 thats a simple way to put it reminds me of the same saying in the bible for whatever a man is sowing this he will also reap galatians 6 7
6634933 i wish i had god like faith as you is that how you keep so positive
6634934 huh oh yes it is jehovah he gives everyone a chance to do whats right
6634935 yeah but i just dont think god could exist if he let all these calamities will happen in the world
6634936 yeah well we can never be sure that terrible future will even happen because god doesnt interfere with our own free will and choices he leaves it to us to make the right decisions its just that people dont always do the right thing because we are imperfect roman 5 12 through one man adam sin entered into the world and death through sin and thus death spread to all men because they had all sinned because they were all born by sinful people
6634937 i think it will be a pleasure working with you in the future david thanks for the cool thoughts from that bible mind of yours youre a little weird
6634938 i thought i was going to totally be done after this olympics
6634939 and i was like you know it wasnt exactly the experience i wanted its not that bad of an injury theres no surgery needed my shoulder held up so well on bars i had no issues with it

6634961 he is the one whos going to help fix the future for us he is johns asset in the future without him johns plan will not work smoothly
6634962 yeah what do you mean how do you know him you two
6634963 hes the reason my men are dead in the safe house sarah
6634964 ah let the metalloid bit amp explain im sure she can do it better job than me she knows the jack ass
6634965 alright lets hear it cameron i want all the details now
6634966 considering that companies rely on their it infrastructure to store and transmit sensitive company employee and customer data risky activities including the ones this survey reveals are of significant concern for all businesses
6634967 using peer to peer networks while at work can breach the confidentiality and security of an entire corporate network including all of the data and internal communications that reside on that network
6634968 i was surprised by his strong reaction i was not targeting him at all
6634969 i was alluding to ibrahim ali whose speech is often provocative and laced with references to malay rights
6634970 her statement showed she was not tolerant of islam and treated it as a second class religion
6634971 i felt her remark was racist since she focused only on chinese issues
6634972 why should i apologise to her in fact i think she should apologise to me
6634973 it is completely unjustified she is not racist at all his statement is no different from umno i would have expected such an outburst from an umno member but not a pkr member
6634974 i am saddened by this view islam is a universal religion and a heritage of the world if i am not right correct me
6634975 just because you accuse me of racism it does not make me one i think his remarks reflects badly on him
6634976 we are in the same coalition she should have discussed with me first
6634977 this is the largest decision the school district will ever make so yes it was a long and somewhat laborious process
6634978 frankly we didnt see any end in sight to the process
6634979 thats really just too long for us to put on hold that significant amount of resources
6634980 there are a number of existing facilities needs on campus that we need to address and can address and we really cant do anything to plan for those needs until we know what the school board is doing
6634981 it looks like with the university offer off the table the financial situation becomes difficult so we have to look at it from that standpoint
6634982 well keep moving ahead its just another mid course correction
6634983 i know the market trends numbers whats happening on the street i use it all to my clients advantage
6634984 listening closely to my clients is the most important step to meeting their needs

6634986 ayers was a guy who bombed the capitol but if you think about it thats really mainstream and respectable
6634987 if he doesnt even have the judgement not to associate with nefarious characters how can he have the judgement to be president
6634988 tail docking a dog would be illegal putting a lobster in boiling water would be illegal but it will be legal to abort a six month old child if this bill passes
6634989 from the outset i have declared that i am pro life i find it extremely difficult to support a bill that enables a woman to abort a baby up to six months gestation
6634990 it effectively is the status quo and provides accepted safeguards and i also have a very solid view that men should not be telling women what to do with their bodies
6634991 i support the original model c as proposed by the victorian law reform commission which goes further than the governments bill and puts the decision in the hands of women at any stage of the pregnancy
6634992 for years the fcc declared that it would take action against any internet service provider caught violating the online rights guaranteed by the agency today the commission has delivered on that promise
6634993 this clear legal precedent signals that the future of the net neutrality debate will be over how not whether to protect users right to an open internet
6634994 the communications act has long established the federal agencys authority to promote the competition consumer choice and diverse information across all communications platforms
6634995 extended these rights to internet users including the right to access the lawful content applications and services of their choice
6634996 the internet is a world wide system that does not belong to any one operator
6634997 the design of the internet protocols specifies clear limits on what operators can and cannot do happily the fcc recognized and exposed comcasts transgressions of those limits

6635031 cuando llegamos al aeropuerto de trelew luego de la fuga del penal de rawson y comprobamos que el avi n ya hab a partido nos quedaba una alternativa dispersamos en la dilatada meseta patag nica
6635032 el oficial de infanter a de marina que dirigi a las fuerzas de la dictadura en el aeropuerto y ante quien nos rendimos formalmente era el capit n sosa
6635033 una vez llegados a la base fuimos alojados en calabozos el primer d a el trato que nos dan es bueno tanto es as que nos dejan durante todo el d a el colch n y las mantas hecho que no volver a repetirse en los d as siguientes sin embargo el buen trato dura poco cuando a la tarde del d a 16 llega el capit n sosa pudimos observar en l un cambio radical se dirige a nosotros en tono muy agresivo dici ndonos por ejemplo la pr xima no habr negociaci n los vamos a cagar a tiros
6635034 nunca nos sacaban a todos juntos de las celdas salvo en dos oportunidades
6635035 queridos compa eros no puedo sino dirigirme a ustedes para informarles acerca de los acontecimientos que los inquietan y que yo he vivido
6635036 el juez federal que intervino en la negociaci n de nuestra rendici n prometi acceder a nuestro requerimiento de que se nos retornara al penal de rawson en forma inmediata dicho juez al igual que el oficial de polic a que lo acompa aba se portaron en forma correcta
6635037 en estos t rminos se planteaba la discusi n aunque luego el capit n sosa accede a los requerimientos y afirma que nos llevar hasta el penal
6635038 ascendemos al micro un poco confiados por la garant a que nos ofrece el juez federal siempre acompa ado por el doctor amaya ambos nos acompa an en el micro hasta la base y en sta hasta el pasillo mismo que conduce a nuestras celdas
6635039 una vez en nuestras celdas aproximadamente cuatro horas despu s bajo pretexto de revisaci n m dica se procede a realizar prolija requisa a rdenes de oficiales m dicos quienes nos ordenan quitarnos la ropa hasta quedar totalmente desnudas miran nuestros cuerpos prolijamente tal vez en busca de alg n arma aunque todos sabemos que la piel no tiene bolsillos ni mochilas
6635040 recuerdo una ocasi n en la cual hab amos estado haciendo toda clase de movimientos ordenados por nuestros carceleros en tal oportunidad el teniente de corbeta bravo coloc su pistola calibre 45 en la cabeza de clarisa lea place al tiempo que amenazaba con matarla porque sta se negaba a colocarse boca arriba en el suelo
6635041 una noche asistimos a un simulacro de fusilamiento y como tal lo asumimos posteriormente
6635042 el d a anterior a los sucesos concurre el juez a presenciar nuevos reconocimientos en rueda de presos claro que sin enterarse del interrogatorio a que nos somet a personal de dipa en una habitaci n cercana al lugar donde l presenciaba los reconocimientos
6635043 escucho otras voces de otras personas diciendo cosas semejantes pero no alcanzo a distinguirlas puesto que inmediatamente nos ordenan salir de nuestras celdas caminando sin levantar los ojos del piso noto que es la primera vez que nos dan tal orden pero no logro adivinar el motivo de la misma
6635044 de pronto imprevistamente sin una sola voz que ordenara como si ya estuvieran todos de acuerdo el cabo obeso comienza a disparar su ametralladora sobre nosotros y al instante el aire se cubri de gritos y balas puesto que todos los oficiales y suboficiales comenzaron a accionar sus armas
6635045 reconozco las voces de mena y su rez por su acento provinciano dando gritos de dolor
6635046 contin an los disparos de arma corta hasta que se hace el silencio s lo quebrado por las idas y venidas de mucha gente ellos llegan nos miran tal vez para cerciorarse si estamos ya muertos cuando descubren alg n herido parece que se tranquilizaran unos a otros pues dicen que al desangrarse morir mientras yo contin o tratando de no dar se ales de vida
6635047 a la hora llega un enfermero que constata el n mero de muertos y heridos tambi n llega una persona importante tal vez un juez o un alto oficial a quien le cuentan una historia inventada
6635048 dos m dicos y algunos enfermeros nos miran pero se abstienen de intervenir
6635049 a pesar de la cercan a de la ciudad de trelew no requieren asistencia m dica de all sino que esperan a que arriben los m dicos desde la base de puerto belgrano quienes lo hacen s lo a mediod a o sea cuatro horas despu s de nuestra llegada a la enfermer a los m dicos reci n llegados nos atienden muy bien me operan all mismo surgiendo dadores de sangre entre los soldados recupero el conocimiento veinticuatro horas despu s de la operaci n ya en un avi n que me transporta a la base de puerto belgrano donde la atenci n m dica contin a siendo muy buena
6635050 despu s de nuestra rendici n en el aeropuerto de trelew fuimos trasladados a la base aeronaval
6635051 entre la noche del martes 15 y la madrugada del mi rcoles 16 nos revisan individualmente dos personas de civil que m s tarde identificamos como m dicos navales
6635052 me toman fotograf as de frente y de perfil me retiran todas mis pertenencias cintur n dinero reloj
6635053 a las cinco de esa madrugada nos entregan colchonetas y dos mantas por persona nos encierran en las celdas con cerrojo y candado y nos dejan dormir aproximadamente hasta el mediod a del mi rcoles 16
6635054 esa noche aparece el oficial de la marina bravo de treinta a os aproximadamente rubio bigotes quien luego est casi permanentemente con nosotros act a desde el comienzo con rudeza y nos somete a un r gido trato militar
6635055 esa misma noche fui v ctima de un castigo que me impuso el capit n sosa
6635056 la custodia a la vez que impresionante era en cierto modo rid cula
6635057 en el pasillo entre las dos l neas de celdas estaban apostados soldados y suboficiales con las armas sin seguro en n mero tal que para caminar era menester abrirse camino entre soldados y oficiales
6635058 para sacamos de las celdas se us al comienzo un procedimiento muy singular
6635059 as transcurri el d a mi rcoles 16 hasta la noche del jueves 18
6635060 todos sin excepci n yo desde luego nos negamos a responder a las diversas preguntas que nos formulaban negativa que provocaba las consiguientes amenazas agravios e insultos cada vez m s agresivos y apremiantes
6635061 ya a esta altura dentro de las mismas celdas nos somet an a un trato muy duro t picamente militar cuerpo a tierra sostener el cuerpo con los dedos apoyados sobre la pared rdenes militares de echarse a tierra y levantarse etc tera
6635062 los insultos y amenazas eran cada vez m s habituales y el tratamiento cada vez m s duro y agresivo se insist a siempre en la orden de que deb amos declarar y todas las presiones y amenazas se dirig an a ese objetivo
6635063 no nos interrogaron esa noche y alrededor de las 3 30 de esa madrugada nos despertaron dando patadas sobre la puerta de las celdas y haciendo sonar violentamente pitos por el mismo ventanuco
6635064 sent entonces casi de inmediato dos r fagas de ametralladora
6635065 durante ese breve lapso escuch una o dos r fagas de ametralladora al comienzo luego varios tiros aislados de distinta arma gemidos y ayes de dolor y respiraciones agotadas o sofocadas
6635066 dirigi ndose a mi me requiri en tono muy duro parec a muy agitado si iba o no a declarar
6635067 yo ca sobre el lado izquierdo mirando hacia la puerta y delfino a mi derecha
6635068 al cabo de ese lapso que no puedo precisar con exactitud llegaron enfermeros navales
6635069 me llevaron a una sala m dica no me sometieron a ninguna curaci n apenas si me limpiaron la herida y creo que me dieron un calmante presumo que as fue porque me dorm all pude ver a mar a antonia berger alfredo kohon carlos astudillo y haidar luego en avi n ya de d a ignoro la hora me trasladaron a puerto belgrano all fui operado tambi n all me entrevist el juez naval ante quien declar sobre estos hechos y ante quien firme mi declaraci n
6635070 it is to wage war by sea land and air with all our might and with all the strength that god can give us to wage war against a monstrous tyranny never surpassed in the dark lamentable catalogue of human crime that is our policy
6635071 we had nothing to do with anything which contributed to my daughters disappearance
6635072 although the police are carrying out investigations it is difficult for my family and me to cope if the police are accusing me of immoral behaviour and they circulate the pictures over the internet
6635073 before i formed you in the womb i knew you and before you were born i consecrated you i have appointed you a prophet to the nations
6635074 alas lord god behold i do not know how to speak because i am a youth
6635075 do not say i am a youth because everywhere i send you you shall go and all that i command you you shall speak do not be afraid of them for i am with you to deliver you
6635076 thus says the lord god of israel thus you are to say to the king of judah who sent you to me to inquire of me behold pharaohs army which has come out for your assistance is going to return to its own land of egypt
6635077 thus says the lord he who stays in this city will die by the sword and by famine and by pestilence but he who goes out to the chaldeans will live and have his own life as booty and stay alive
6635078 now let this man be put to death inasmuch as he is discouraging the men of war who are left in this city and all the people by speaking such words to them for this man is not seeking the well being of this people but rather their harm
6635079 behold he is in your hands for the king can do nothing against you
6635080 my lord the king these men have acted wickedly in all that they have done to jeremiah the prophet whom they have cast into the cistern and he will die right where he is because of the famine for there is no more bread in the city
6635081 take thirty men from here under your authority and bring up jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies
6635082 now put these worn out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes

6635088 dont smoke because people are three times more likely to get pneumonia if theyve smoked and if they continue to smoke if you do stop for about five years your risk goes down
6635089 just yesterday our office received our flu shots and so i would recommend for anybody who wants to prevent getting the flu to come get a flu shot
6635090 we know that if youre between the ages of 50 and 64 your ten times more likely to have a serious complication from the flu but if youre over the age of 65 you are ten times more likely than those between the ages of 50 and 64 to have problem with influenza
6635091 but the biggest trouble with shingles is not actually getting the blisters but a lot of people can have what we call post herpetic neuralgia with chronic nerve pain even after the rash goes away

6635095 its unlikely that a broadcast network is ever again going to create a megahit like the cosby show which at its mid 80s peak drew as many as 50 million viewers an episode for several years now tvs top event has been foxs american idol last season it drew 28 8 million viewers a week
6635096 in many ways the networks themselves already have specific brand identities they just dont admit it for decades cbs has had the most elderly demographic among the major networks abc specializes in comedies and light dramas with strong female appeal fox with the exception of american idol is largely aimed at guys the fledgling cw is building on gossip girl and americas next top model to chase young women nbcs struggles are not unrelated to the fact that its still trying to be all things to all people

6635134 many of the poorest households end up paying more for their energy and water bills because they dont have bank accounts and cant pay by direct debit
6635135 our plan developed with industry will help people struggling with rising household bills by letting them use their post office card account to pay their utility bills
6635136 offers to put more money in the pockets of poorer consumers by reducing their outgoings and providing for weekly budgeting to help avoid debt
6635137 however active the leading group may be its activity will amount to fruitless effort by a handful of people unless combined with the activity of the masses on the other hand if the masses alone are active without a strong leading group to organize their activity properly such activity cannot be sustained for long or carried forward in the right direction or raised to a high level
6635138 to link oneself with the masses one must act in accordance with the needs and wishes of the masses all work done for the masses must start from their needs and not from the desire of any individual however well intentioned it often happens that objectively the masses need a certain change but subjectively they are not yet conscious of the need not yet willing or determined to make the change in such cases we should wait patiently we should not make the change until through our work most of the masses have become conscious of the need and are willing and determined to carry it out otherwise we shall isolate ourselves from the masses unless they are conscious and willing any kind of work that requires their participation will fail there are two principles here one is the actual needs of the masses rather than what we fancy they need and the other is the wishes of the masses who must make up their own minds instead of our making up their minds for them
6635139 if we tried to go on the offensive when the masses are not yet awakened that would be adventurism if we insisted on leading the masses to do anything against their will we would certainly fail if we did not advance when the masses demand advance that would be right opportunism

6635151 obamas measured style worked in the spring but hurt him over the summer one of the great strengths of the obama candidacy has been the sense that this is a guy whose blood doesnt boil who carefully considers the options before he reacts but thats also a weakness sometimes the most rational response is to rip your opponents lungs that sort of spontaneity that sort of real passion is whats missing from this candidacy i suspect obama will have a hard time winning unless he finds some of it

6635223 the first half of 2008 was the coolest for at least five years the world meteorological organisation wmo said on wednesday
6635224 summer heat continues in short supply continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st centurys opening decade
6635225 there have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at midway airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 thats by far the fewest 90 degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930
6635226 the almanacs 2009 edition which goes on sale tuesday says at least two thirds of the country can expect colder than average temperatures with only the far west and southeast in line for near normal readings
6635227 based on the past armagh measurements this suggests that over the next two decades global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees c that is to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years

6635254 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
6635255 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
6635256 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
6635257 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

6635260 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
6635261 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
6635262 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo

6635275 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

6635311 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
6635312 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
6635313 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
6635314 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
6635315 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

6635322 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras

6635327 we can finally close the book on this and raul can rest in peace
6635328 were very disappointed by the verdict and believe we have a number of good issues on appeal
6635329 this guy right here irrevocably changed so many lives when he chose to arm himself that night
6635330 raul briseno had too much pride to give in to a couple of punks and he chased them out and he paid for it with his life
6635331 the suggestion that no blood transferred onto that jacket and mr houghtaling was so confident that no blood transferred onto it that he wore it into the police station is totally incredible
6635332 the man as i think we all saw is crazy
6635333 thats the crux of the states case and theres nothing there
6635334 he had no motivation to implicate himself in the crime yet he gave specific details
6635335 the investigations found that all the mis are either insolvent on a cash flow basis a balance sheet basis or on the basis of the accounts kept by pwl have no assets or liabilities
6635336 further mis involving the growing of grapes would require members to pay more funds than they are likely to receive in revenue for the remainder of those mis
6635337 as a result none of the mis have the working capital required to continue to operate and the administrators are not aware of anyone who would be willing to contribute sufficient working capital to resolve the situation
6635338 we consider the prospects for finding such a replacement to be very low
6635339 wenn mir jemand gesagt h tte dass eine deutsche country music arrangieren produzieren und singen k nnte als ob sie eine amerikanerin w re und einer von nashvilles top produzenten dies produziert h tte ich h tte tr nen gelacht nun jetzt weine ich weil dies ein wundersch nes album der sehr talentierten s ngerin katja kaye ist warm lebendig gef hlvoll und wahrhaft echter country vielleicht sollte sich nashville dieses album anh ren um herauszufinden wo sie vom weg abgekommen sind

6635344 we do not have a water crisis we have a management crisis
6635345 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
6635346 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
6635347 here is an opportunity to see what we do from the inside write what you feel
6635348 i wonder if these people realize the potential they have at their fingertips
6635349 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
6635350 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
6635351 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
6635352 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
6635353 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
6635354 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6635355 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6635356 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
6635357 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
6635358 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
6635359 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
6635360 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
6635361 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
6635362 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
6635363 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
6635364 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
6635365 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
6635366 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
6635367 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
6635368 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
6635369 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
6635370 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
6635371 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
6635372 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
6635373 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
6635374 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente
6635375 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
6635376 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
6635377 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
6635378 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
6635379 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
6635380 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6635381 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6635382 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6635383 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
6635384 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
6635385 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
6635386 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
6635387 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
6635388 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
6635389 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
6635390 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
6635391 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
6635392 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
6635393 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
6635394 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
6635395 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
6635396 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
6635397 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
6635398 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
6635399 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
6635400 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
6635401 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
6635402 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
6635403 would you be mad if i became more blog famous than you
6635404 i would love it if you got blog famous and i could still feed off of her fame by telling everyone she is my sister
6635405 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
6635406 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
6635407 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
6635408 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
6635409 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
6635410 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
6635411 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
6635412 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
6635413 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
6635414 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
6635415 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
6635416 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
6635417 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
6635418 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
6635419 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
6635420 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
6635421 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
6635422 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
6635423 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
6635424 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
6635425 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
6635426 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers
6635427 like everyone he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong something that only pirates would do
6635428 the rewards are in your head the reward is invisible its what you like to do
6635429 we had dreams that computers would improve education and improve communication and help us achieve a lot of tasks a lot of us in our group understood it
6635430 what we were doing was not figuring out how to build a computer it was how you get a computer that fits into the home price looks a lot of that stuff it gave us more passion we used the word revolution all over the place
6635431 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
6635432 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
6635433 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
6635434 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
6635435 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
6635436 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
6635437 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6635438 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
6635439 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
6635440 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
6635441 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
6635442 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
6635443 el que cree que quemando una casa con el due o adentro va a solucionar un solo tema del pueblo mapuche no solamente est equivocado sino que est colocando en riesgo todo lo que se pueda hacer por resolver los problemas hist ricos del pueblo mapuche
6635444 la fiscal a a lo largo de chile no tolera la impunidad y en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas
6635445 los rganos de resistencia de nuestra naci n mapuche han realizado una acci n de justicia frente al despojo hist rico de nuestra naci n en contra de latifundistas que mantienen ocupado nuestro wallmapu territorio mapuche a m s de 7 meses del asesinato por la espalda del weichafe mat as catrileo no existe la m s m nima se al de justicia de parte del estado de chile y no creemos que sta venga de quien nos golpea cotidianamente y que contin a actuando contra nuestras comunidades frente a acciones de este tipo y en vista de que la justicia no se vislumbra por ninguna parte para nuestra naci n nos reservamos el derecho a responder a las agresiones de parte de agentes del estado
6635446 se hizo porque hubo una grave alteraci n al orden p blico no tenemos antecedentes para invocar la ley antiterrorista
6635447 no podemos decir a priori que aqu hay personas de la etnia mapuche o no la investigaci n arrojar ese resultado y como siempre esperamos que sea acuciosa r pida y con resultados a la brevedad
6635448 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales
6635449 quisiera expresar mi en rgica condena al atentado incendiario en la novena regi n porque yo estoy segura que estos hechos son delictuales no tienen nada que ver con los intereses y demandas del pueblo mapuche
6635450 la ciudadan a sepa que frente a situaciones y actos como estos vamos a aplicar toda la fuerza y el rigor que nos confiere la ley porque la democracia cost mucho recuperarla y los chilenos y chilenas queremos vivir en progreso prosperidad pero tambi n en paz
6635451 condeno este hecho porque vemos una vez m s que este tema no est terminado en la araucan a estos hechos de violencia requieren de medidas urgentes por parte del ministerio del interior se trata que apliquen la ley de seguridad interior del estado hay que buscar la mayor rigurosidad de la ley para mantener el estado de derecho y aplicar la mayor cantidad de sanciones
6635452 hay que revisar el actuar del gobierno no s lo deben preocuparse de entregarle predios al pueblo mapuche sino adem s debe brindarle elementos para que se inserten en la sociedad como la educaci n y puedan tener una actividad que les permita seguir viviendo
6635453 acci n de justicia frente a latifundistas que mantienen ocupado territorio mapuche
6635454 esas afirmaciones me parecen irresponsables la ley es para que la cumplan todos los chilenos este fue un acto criminal y a los responsables se les debe aplicar toda la rigurosidad de la ley
6635455 esto repercute en el desarrollo de la regi n porque qui n va a querer invertir en una zona donde hay este tipo de conflictos
6635456 what do we now i know start a blog vent vent vent vent vent send mission accomplished i dont want to put down the idea of blogs the blog explosion has happened in part because more and more people completely distrust the joke of corporate mcnews
6635457 the blogosphere is limited to an echo chamber where all agree with all
6635458 when you look at big picture its pretty damn depressing but doesnt stop people from winning small local battles
6635459 this is a contest a war and its not red against blue or left against right its between the top and the bottom a class war is being waged in this country against almost everybody who lives in this country
6635460 life doesnt have to be this way we dont have to be so stupid we dont have to be so obedient we need to illuminate whats possible illuminating good ideas is what put them on track to slowly becoming reality
6635461 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
6635462 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
6635463 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
6635464 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
6635465 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
6635466 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
6635467 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
6635468 the ruling is basically giving processors giving those who deal with providing fresh or minimally processed spinach or lettuce to consumers an additional tool another technology to reduce the level of microorganisms that are of concern

6635491 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
6635492 to be able to wean down the dosage of the medication in small amounts and relatively quickly that is encouraging
6635493 when kidney transplants first began people were reluctant to donate because there were a lot of cultural social and religious issues
6635494 everyone says they would accept a face transplant if they were disfigured
6635495 the real question is would you be a donor or would you allow your family member to donate their face that is the answer we need to change

6635522 diantara bangsa atas dan bangsa bawah terdapat sebuah organisasi rahasia organisasi ini terdiri atas penduduk bangsa bawah yang bekerja dan hidup bersama bangsa atas mereka disebut sebagai agen penyelaras seperti halnya sebuah sistem ekonomi dimana ada tiga unsur pelaku produsen distributor dan konsumen keberadaan agen penyelaras di tengah tengah bangsa atas sangatlah diperlukan oleh bangsa bawah dalam proses rantai makanan mereka bukanlah kanibal melainkan manusia murni yang hidup diantara bangsa atas mereka memiliki perilaku tabiat sifat dan karakter yang sama dengan manusia bangsa atas mereka tidak memakan bangkai manusia mereka juga tidak memiliki gigi gigi yang tajam seperti halnya manusia bangsa bawah pada umumnya dari segi fisik dan profesi mereka sama persis dengan manusia bangsa atas mereka ada yang menjadi pengusaha atlit sutradara politikus penulis musisi aktor ilmuan bahkan pemuka agama ya semua agen penyelaras memiliki keyakinan terhadap tuhan mereka beribadah seperti layaknya manusia bangsa atas mereka menjadi agen penyelaras bukanlah karena suatu materi doktrin ataupun paksaan mereka melakukannya dengan penuh kesadaran karena mereka percaya bahwa untuk menjaga kedamaian dan ketentraman dunia ini siklus hidup dan mati manusia haruslah berjalan normal semua agen penyelaras merasa bahwa keberadaan mereka memang diperlukan demi mempertahankan keutuhan dan kelangsungan hidup manusia secara keseluruhan beberapa agen penyelaras di masa lalu yang cukup dikenal luas adalah hitler mussolini pol pot dan jan pieterzoon coen sementara di abad 21 salah satu yang paling populer adalah george w bush
6635523 sebenarnya bagi agen penyelaras perang hanyalah salah satu cara untuk menjaga keseimbangan populasi manusia disamping melalui penyakit mematikan seperti sars anthrax avian flu dan malaria mereka juga berupaya supaya penyakit berbahaya seperti aids tetap tidak ada penyembuhnya kenapa agar perusahaan kondom milik mereka bisa menyerap banyak tenaga kerja dengan tingginya produksi kondom maka secara tidak langsung perkebunan getah karet milik mereka yang kini mulai tersingkir oleh perkebunan tembakau dan cengkeh milik kaum illuminati juga akan terselamatkan perseteruan dalam bisnis ini memang sudah terjadi sejak lama diantara keduanya baik dari segi intelegensi maupun teknologi keduanya sama sama berupaya untuk menjadi yang terdepan meski memiliki visi yang sama dalam menjaga sistem rotasi regenerasi umat manusia kesepakatan untuk saling bekerjasama tidak pernah terjadi diantara mereka itu terjadi karena mereka memiliki prinsip dasar yang berbeda agen penyelaras bertujuan untuk mengurangi sedangkan kaum illuminati bertujuan untuk menambah hidup manusia akan terus berkembang bila jumlah manusia di bumi ini terus bertambah itulah keyakinan kuat yang dimiliki oleh kaum illuminati oleh sebab itu industri pornografi baik yang terselubung maupun terang terangan masih tetap eksis hingga saat kini dan negara negara berkembang adalah salah satu lahan subur yang menjadi sasaran mereka di negara negara tersebut ajaran ajaran discordia milik mereka ditancapkan erat erat ke dalam setiap benak anggota masyarakat istilah istilah modern seperti seks education nude is art make love not war hingga istilah klasik seperti banyak anak banyak rejeki merupakan beberapa istilah yang paling santer terdengar kuatnya ajaran ini bahkan telah mempengaruhi banyak kepala negara di negara negara berkembang untuk tidak menempatkan masalah populasi penduduk sebagai prioritas utama tidak heran bahwa kampanye global yang disebut sebagai mdg tidak pernah mengusung pentingnya membatasi jumlah kepadatan penduduk ambiguitas itulah ciri yang paling mudah dikenali dari kaum illuminati seperti halnya sebuah idiom yang menyebutkan bahwa uang bukanlah segalanya tetapi segalanya butuh uang kaum illuminati selalu berusaha untuk membuat warga dunia merasa resah dan bimbang

6635611 the strength of our second quarter financial performance completes an excellent first half of 2008
6635612 following the recent decisions concerning the gronau committee recommendations by the minister of communications on august 13th we are pleased to have some initial clarity on the regulatory front although we cannot assess at this stage what will be the exact impact on the groups business results
6635613 while the details of these decisions and many other aspects of the new regulatory guidelines remain to be clarified we believe that over the long term the net impact from the expected regulatory changes will benefit service providers that are able to offer a comprehensive range of communications services which is where bezeq excels as the market leader overall our aim remains to maintain our position as the leading communications service provider in israel while continuing to deliver long term value to our customers employees and shareholders
6635614 based on the strength of our second quarter and first half 2008 financial performance and healthy cash flows from operations we are pleased to announce that our board of directors has recommended the distribution of a cash dividend to shareholders totaling nis 835 million this is in addition to the nis 679 million dividend declared last march and paid during the second quarter
6635615 while improvements during the second quarter were evident across our key profitability measures we did experience an increase in finance expenses during the second quarter primarily due to the fact that most of the groups debt is linked to the israeli consumer price index which increased 2 24 during the quarter resulting in higher financing expenses as compared to the year ago period we are pleased with the group wide performance in the first half of the year and look forward to building on these gains in the second half of 2008

6635768 we would certainly question the judgment of that lawyer and might reasonably conclude that the person who took the appointment and thus gave legitimacy to president mugabes repressive and undemocratic modus operandi had acted unprofessionally
6635769 it is time for ms scutt to do the right thing by the people of fiji by resigning her commission and returning to australia
6635770 this column has been pondering and predicting an obama biden ticket for some time now thats still the best bet and now that the announcement is finally imminent everyone is talking about it so what the heck lets run the hillary clinton scenario one more time barack obama and hillary clinton like one another obama had clintons cell number on speed dial and vice versa they maintained stable even good personal relations during the primary campaign but we always knew that the what to do with bill clinton challenge would steer obama away from an easy or casual selection of hillary clinton as his vice presidential running mate

6635776 when we drive down through town and look at that mural on the wall of sherman rose and those tuskegee airmen we want to always remember sherman and what he did and what he stood for
6635777 this was kind of unheard of as having an afro american instructors at fort rucker in fact it was kind of unheard to have one afro american in any one flight class in fort rucker
6635778 he has a far region of impact on many people in many ways that we may never imagine
6635779 thats one thing i learned about influence is that you never can measure it

6635816 sorry for the inconvenience but i unfortunately have to remove this post that is all i can say at this time
6635817 gene was a great player he was an all pro he was a hall of famer if you look at the history of the nfl youre going to find out that he was one of the most influential people that the league has known he did so much not only for the players but also for the owners the teams and the game of pro football
6635818 this is deeper than head of the union passing away and its deeper than an ex player this is missing someone that is and was like family its a tough day for all of us
6635819 from what i hear he was a pretty good player
6635820 he was and will remain a part of the fabric of our lives and of the raider mystique and legacy
6635821 we loved him and he loved us we will miss him
6635822 everybody can sit back and obviously some people might criticize some of the things hes done but overall i dont think you could have asked for a better leader
6635823 the reality of life for all the guys who played in the nfl including gene is that we have a short life span its just the way it is
6635824 i have sympathy for his family i have sympathy for his wife and children
6635825 in both careers if you hit him in the head he could hit you back twice as hard but he didnt always do so
6635826 he was very tough but also a good listener he never lost sight of the interests of the game and the big picture
6635827 he was the rare individual who earned his place in the both for his accomplishments on the field and for his leadership of the players off the field he fought hard for the players and always kept his focus on what was best for the game his leadership played a crucial role in taking the nfl and its players to new heights
6635828 weve asked the gymnastics federation to look into it further
6635829 if there is a question mark and we have a concern which we do we ask the governing body of any sport to look into it
6635830 we are not in a position to say its good its not good its a government document
6635831 i was born in 1992 and im 16 years old now
6635832 the fig has proved that if im under 16 i couldnt have been competing here
6635833 the people were killed and the planes were blown up
6635834 the l train got to first avenue and a bunch of people piled out
6635835 we are a small rural district in the bible belt with strong christian beliefs and feel like homosexuality is wrong
6635836 i dont think we are that different from a lot of districts at least in the panhandle that have beliefs that maybe are different from societal changes
6635837 what happens when these kids get out in the real world after they leave ponce de leon and they have a black homosexual supervisor at their job
6635838 i emphasize that daviss personal and religious views about homosexuality are not issues in this case indeed daviss opinions and views are consistent with the beliefs of many in holmes county in florida and in the country
6635839 where davis went wrong was when he endeavored to silence the opinions of his dissenters
6635840 david davis is a fine man and good principal and we are a gentle peaceful christian family oriented community
6635841 but i think thats less of an issue here than in miami or minnesota
6635842 but when my time comes id be more comfortable with something like this natural casket
6635843 oh atin you look so handsome mother would be so proud of you and father too
6635844 how can i protect you if i cant even save my own sister how can i protect our daughters
6635845 she said my parents would be proud of the man ive become
6635846 i couldnt save my family i couldnt save trystan jayda my father and mother the might mandalore the supreme couldnt even save his own flesh and blood
6635847 atin love you are only one person you are not a god though some may believe you are you cant accomplish everything save everybody even though you may want to and have the drive to try i love you and your little girls love you too youve done an amazing job of keeping us safe so far im not giving up on you ever so dont give up on yourself your sister was right they would be proud of you i know i am this world in which we live atin is not a pleasent one we both learned that at a young age but we need to keep trying theres no point in giving up now
6635848 theyre animals and i slaughtered them like animals im no better than those bastards who killed our people on verdo
6635849 what you did was justified by what they had done to you and the past and what theyve been doing to your sister these long years i never saw her but i dont expect that her physical appearance was anywhere close to the way it would have been years ago those men no not men those animals those pigs had no justification for what they did to our people what they were doing to your sister you gave them what was coming to them with that said you told me that you wanted to live in a world full of peace well with animals like them in it there will never be peace im not justifying that killing is good but killing for the purposes you did was justified you are different than them you are a better person you just have to look at the full situation i love you atin no matter what you know that i will always be here for you
6635850 a low price in dollars is never the best way to measure true cost
6635851 i n fact if you see something thats cheap thats almost a sign that it has a whole host of externalized costs its not accounting for
6635852 hand washing today is about more than just cleanliness people want to prevent the spread of germs
6635853 dhc hand soap meets this challenge and then some its instant lather washes away dirt and reduces bacteria to sanitize hands and thanks to conditioning collagen sorbitol and glycerin it wont strip or dry out skin
6635854 when the tea lady starts to invest in the stock market its time to get out

6635856 pile a lot of rocks on top of me to keep the coyotes off
6635857 after the moment of death we should get the hell out of the way with our bodies decently planted in the earth to nourish other forms of life weeds flowers shrubs trees which support other forms of life which support the ongoing human pageant the lives of our children
6635858 this is not a brothel there are no prostitutes here
6635859 yes your cv is very good but could you please underline that you know how to use frontpage
6635860 2 the salary is low the starting salary for a tenure truck assistant professorship is around 50k it is low i would be happy with this kind of salary for the rest of my life
6635861 i dont even see you if i dont like you
6635862 we were reminded of death and dying wherever we went
6635863 when i die i dont want this to happen to me
6635864 very often families will open a bottle of wine or champagne and toast the deceased at their tree
6635865 the sound of glasses clinking in the forest is so moving its very emotional
6635866 that survey shows that funeral traditions in germany are changing
6635867 implicit in the proposals that call for the control and or eradication of invasive species is the assumption that the native vegetation will return to dominance once the invasive is removed thereby restoring the balance of nature
6635868 traditional forms of gardening for example are valuable in part because they provide a context for a creative engagement with the landscape at the level of the ecological community ecological restoration in contrast is valuable as a special form of gardening that is or at least aims to be explicitly noncreative with respect to objectives neither improving on nature nor improvising on it but attempting blankly to copy it the value of the deliberately noncreative act as a stilling of the will an expression of obedience and humility and the entrainment of consciousness to the gesture and movement of the other an important element in religious practice becomes clear but this value is compromised or missed entirely so long as we insist only on the creative aspects of restoration and deny the commitment to noncreativity at its core
6635869 oil prices are influenced by the u s dollars retreat and diplomatic tensions between the u s and russia
6635870 saya masih kesulitan menyantumkan identitas agama khonghucu di ktp dan kk saya sendiri
6635871 pertanyaan pertanyaan itu seolah hendak memberitahukan ke siswa siswa lain apa betul khonghucu itu agama atau bukan
6635872 ini menunjukkan bahwa persoalan tak hanya dalam konteks antaragama tetapi juga intra agama
6635873 agar rencana pendirian vihara di aceh bisa terwujud kami berbaur dulu dengan masyarakat di sana dalam peringatan 17 agustus kemarin misalnya kami turut berbagai lomba agustusan seperti panjat pinang dan sebagainya
6635874 masyarakat di sana heran koq ada orang tionghoa yang mau main panjat pinang
6635875 kami di tangerang ini sudah sejak ratusan tahun yang lalu suku suku lain seperti batak jawa atau padang lah yang merupakan pendatang di tangerang bukan kami yang tonghoa
6635876 justru para pendatang inilah yang kerap membuat masalah di tangerang misalnya begitu berdiri rumah padang di satu tempat langsung disampingnya didirikan warteg oleh orang tegal kemudian muncullah persoalan
6635877 tetapi saya menolak tegas bujuk rayu itu tidak tahu apa kalau saya ini guru agama buddha
6635878 sekularisme pluralisme dan liberalisme itu kan pemikiran bagaimana mungin pikiran bisa dihakimi

6635883 help preserve a forest but establish a relationship to it that is not just about death but life
6635884 we need to motivate americans to come into their forests and see them for the peaceful places they are
6635885 why do the smoke stacks of the cremetorium have those balconies around them
6635886 on their way up the chimney the gases go through four separate treatments phosphorous used to go right out of circulation every time they cremated someone now they recover over ninety eight percent of it more than a kilo and a half per adult corpse which makes the best part of 400 hundred tons of phosphorous every year from england alone
6635887 fine to think that we can go on being socially useful even after were dead making plants grow
6635888 it is not on the agenda as far as i am concerned and i will be chairing the meeting
6635889 the honourable thing for the conservative party to do would be to apologise to orangemen

6635898 we walked out of that hospital with our daughter in our arms
6635899 typically what we want to see is a hose running nice and slowly saturating that root zone and then letting it dry out before you water again youre not going to water in this type of condition though so definitely take care of those trees get them plenty of water at least once a week
6635900 i have said that people get rich by doing things in a certain way and in order to do so people must become able to think in a certain way
6635901 a persons way of doing things is the direct result of the way he thinks about things
6635902 to do things in the way you want to do them you will have to acquire the ability to think the way you want to think this is the first step toward getting rich
6635903 and to think what you want to think is to think truth regardless of appearances
6635904 the path that lies before you is one of unlimited abundance and it begins by seeing the abundance available all around you
6635905 as you begin to experience life through the new lens of abundance youll find that many of the problems you face today will simply disappear as for the ones that remain your relationship to them will have changed profoundly empowering you to take actions that are congruent with and support abundance
6635906 is the path that leads ultimately to the fulfillment of your dreams
6635907 the u s credit problem has been an issue from before but global recession will be the main theme
6635908 it felt so good to put my arms around him
6635909 hes home safe and we just kept in touch a lot over the last 9 months just having him in my arms was really a good feeling for a mother who has a son in the war
6635910 they only got to call like every couple of days
6635911 so if i didnt hear from him in two weeks my heart was like oh my gosh bad anxiety
6635912 look at all this it makes you feel like you really did something like a feeling of accomplishment
6635913 the decedent did not have a history of chronic drug abuse
6635914 i had no direct knowledge and no direct participation in the recent care of the patients in question
6635915 patient confidentiality laws prevent me from discussing these or any other patients who may have been admitted to the facility
6635916 not a very good track record especially at an expensive hospital like that
6635917 all three reports tend to indicate that were bottoming out but that there is no real end in sight and thats what i think the market has to get used to
6635918 the first casualty of an attempt to arrest the president is the international operations in darfur the next casualty would be international peacekeepers
6635919 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6635920 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
6635921 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
6635922 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
6635923 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
6635924 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
6635925 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
6635926 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
6635927 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
6635928 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
6635929 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
6635930 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
6635931 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun

6635933 poll watch detroit free press local 4 michigan general election
6635934 this is the first report to conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases tobacco use
6635935 its the first report to make the conclusion that there is a causal relationship between exposure to depiction of smoking in the movies and youth beginning to smoke
6635936 cigarettes are one of the most heavily marketed products in the united states
6635937 now it is up to the government to consider the evidence and think about what it needs to do in terms of advertising and promotion
6635938 this report sends an unmistakable message to our elected officials that they can dramatically reduce tobacco use by children and by adults by passing legislation that would authorize the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products and by adequately funding their state prevention and cessation programs
6635939 it appears that many of the conclusions in the report are based on marketing practices that are more than 30 or 40 years old
6635940 we think its important to focus on the marketing practices that we have in place today
6635941 penalties here are the most severe in the country the testing here is the most stringent in the country
6635942 some people chose to take their horses off steroids right away and some didnt of course it left the edge with the ones that are using it
6635943 it makes it inequitable for people who are trying to do the right thing even though its still legal its still doesnt make sense that one person should have an advantage over another
6635944 will continue to live in perpetual fear without knowing who the next victim would be
6635945 i did i feel a little stupid that i hadnt watched the show prior to meeting with them in new york
6635946 but im happy to say the episodes they sent me to look at after were really really engaging and really wonderful and kind of dark and moody like a lot of the work ive been involved in
6635947 the most important thing for me to remember is not to mistake my presence for the event
6635948 the event is the show the event is csi everyone has a responsibility to bring their unique talents and gifts to it and thats what im going to do im going to enter into this with the most positive attitude i can im coming to work with people who are wonderful who have made great television for nine years thats a gift all i can say is that im ready to play
6635949 i think it was misreported a little bit in terms of this character having the genetic profile of a serial killer
6635950 in reality there is no such thing from the outset what we really wanted to play with in a dramatic sense is a character who has been able to examine his own genetic profile to a certain extent and find certain complexes and certain clusters of biological facts that he has in common with that is associated with aggressive or criminal behavior thats all it is
6635951 the sense that if you find within yourself certain tendencies and see certain behaviors it lets you wonder how these things turn into murder how they turn into violence how they turn into criminal behavior thats all it is its an underlying element for the character
6635952 the character that were creating has a background as a medical doctor a research pathologist in fact
6635953 and for a number of reasons that will be revealed over the course of the season we will find out that hes been forced out of that career and has become a college lecturer hes teaching a course in criminalistics when he gets involved in a csi investigation
6635954 were a show that spends a lot of time thinking
6635955 we dont blow stuff up were not about chasing people down and shooting people and the quality we were looking for was deep intelligence mr fishburne when you look at his work hes always brought that sensibility to the material hes done it was a perfect fit for csi
6635956 its another medium in which to work as an actor
6635957 were not saying that ottawa is more aggressive than any other team but each individual players face predicts how much time he had in the box
6635958 we wanted to come up with the idea of readily available statistics penalty minutes
6635959 chris neil was off the chart in the face ratio
6635960 seemingly its more of a theory than a scientific fact
6635961 it might have implications for the type of officiating they get
6635962 you two look like training soldiers to me with those haircuts probably havent had a girl in a while well i got clean girls nice girls redheads blondes black chinese whatever you like cheap and clean what do you like
6635963 do you have some girls in catholic school dresses pimp
6635964 so we could look like we were out on a double date and not just a couple of lonely dorks
6635965 i think the administration feels that i was ineffective and would be ineffective in the future in representing veterans over at the legislature
6635966 as for the reasons thats debatable but in my opinion as a result of comments ms vincent made to the commission they asked for my resignation
6635967 i appreciate hal dulles service on the missouri veterans commission and wish him well
6635968 i commend him for his service to our nation as a veteran and to our state on this important commission
6635969 we are proud of the service mr dulle has provided veterans and the state of missouri
6635970 i was in that meeting tuesday and he wasnt asked to resign
6635971 offering these slate tiles which are just a small sample of the mansions historic charm for sale on the internet gives missourians and anyone interested in history and this historic home a chance to bring some of that history into their own homes
6635972 i talked to him every day it was like an hourlong conversation each time
6635973 we were even closer than if we grew up together
6635974 one of the goals of johns life was getting us all back together unfortunately it was after his death that it happened
6635975 he lived three doors down from me and a mutual friend introduced us
6635976 it was love at first sight for me he was so full of life and outgoing
6635977 he grabbed one of the rags i worked with and hid the engagement ring in there and i picked it up and the ring fell out
6635978 he was the best daddy you could ever hope for
6635979 he did stuff with them all the time in the winter he would go sledding and in the summer hed go bike riding and fishing with them
6635980 we would just drive around and talk and enjoy each others company
6635981 people would call who we hadnt heard from in years and he would go and help them
6635982 anytime i needed to talk or needed anything he was there he was not judgmental
6635983 reporters or city officials and their staff members may simply not have time to head back to their hotels to file stories or transmit important information to each other

6635985 defendant intended for customers to believe its statements and representations about the defective iphone 3gs and to trust that the device was twice as fast at half the price
6635986 immediately after purchase plaintiff soon noticed that her internet connection receipt and sending of e mail text messages and other data transfers were slower than expected and advertised
6635987 the defective iphone 3g appeared to connect to the 3g standard and protocol less than 25 percent of the time additionally plaintiff experienced an inordinate amount of dropped calls
6635988 resonance technology like the mit demonstration requires a heavy infrastructure right now with coils of at least two feet to accomplish even a small distance
6635989 add to that a 35 percent loss in power this is not insignificant

6636006 im going to be accused of losing my mind after throwing the ball 18 times
6636007 lakota east made it tough on us to run so to cross the goal line we had to put it in the air
6636008 honestly i was a little bit surprised we went to the air that much
6636009 we knew their safeties would be flying up because of our triple option reputation so we took advantage with the passes
6636010 we shot ourselves down the sink real quick with turnovers two lost fumbles early and giving up big passes
6636011 centerville is an awfully good team that strives for possession
6636012 i just read the quarterbacks eyes and he underthrew it a little bit out in the flat
6636013 this is a huge win for us weve talked about springboro the entire off season and expected it to be a very close game winning like this was a surprise
6636014 there was a lot of emotion and tense nerves in that first half
6636015 kings seized the momentum and things just kind of snowballed on us
6636016 we controlled the line of scrimmage on both sides more than i expected i thought it was going to be a very close game because springboro is a very good team this was just a huge huge win for us
6636017 kingston gwen and gavin rossdale welcomed the newest member of their family mother baby and family are all happy and healthy
6636018 he really thinks he has a chance at the short straw
6636019 but there has to be a level of maturity when it comes to a discussion on this
6636020 the airline industry is very fragmented it is hugely capital intensive other airlines are starting to merge and we must be part of that
6636021 it doesnt mean the kangaroo will go it doesnt mean the brand will go it will be probably very similar to what it is now people have got to understand that this will happen
6636022 i am not saying there is anybody out there at the moment all i am saying is that many airlines are now merging in situations where they probably would not have considered it three or four or even five years ago
6636023 but we still are not big enough in five to 10 years to do it on our own i believe it will be sooner rather than later
6636024 wow ive always wanted to read that and that and that if i buy that copy though there wont be enough for zs students better put it back
6636025 uh oh i was planning on using that novel next semester in my class but x is teaching it this semester oh well

6636028 consumer price index research series using current methods 1978 1998
6636029 the measured rate of inflation would have been lower since 1978 if methods currently used in calculating the consumer price index for all urban consumers had been in place from that year to the present
6636030 changed homeowners component from cost of purchase to to value of rental services and 1999 the last 5 in 1998 1999 were maybe in response to the 1996
6636031 large number of banks mis marked assets u k regulator says
6636032 we recommend that you consider carefully any headcount reduction exercises that will affect valuation control functions at this sensitive time
6636033 the fact that weve sent a dear ceo letter isnt unprecedented but its rare
6636034 it means that its an issue were taking very seriously
6636035 the fsa has been chomping at the bit to bring an enforcement case based on a lack of systems and controls
6636036 one percent of australias reserves would produce 26 000 years of energy supplies
6636037 huge potential both as a solution to climate change and in terms of national energy security
6636038 roughly 1 900 drilling rigs in the u s seven maybe up to 11 now are geothermal
6636039 geology brings magma and heat closer to the surface in the western u s if we could drill deeper then we could move east
6636040 you cheated two vulnerable people of the large part of the real value of an elderly mans home

6636042 the campaign made good progress by establishing an ad hoc legal committee to draft an international law criminalizing any insult to islam and the prophet mohammed s as well as all the other prophets which is the strategic objective of the campaign

6636044 we are here to stay and todays announcement is the latest evidence of our commitment
6636045 they set the stage by negotiating a labor agreement thats competitive with any in the united states
6636046 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6636047 the cobalt is a strong car but the cruze is going to be bigger it will offer better fuel economy and more features and so we hope we can see some opportunity on pricing
6636048 with the capital markets weve had fits and starts of opportunities but they havent opened up robustly i hope that happens soon but we cant bet on that
6636049 may the lamb that was slain receive the reward of his suffering
6636050 i can do all things through christ who strengthens me
6636051 overwhelmed by the wonderful and irresistible power of the lord
6636052 hardly knew whether they belonged to earth or had already gone to heaven we saw the hand of god and were all baptized with his holy spirit the holy ghost came upon us and in those days great signs and wonders took place in our midst
6636053 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
6636054 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
6636055 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
6636056 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
6636057 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
6636058 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
6636059 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
6636060 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
6636061 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
6636062 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
6636063 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
6636064 sal a un piloto encendido y que no sab a de qu se trataba
6636065 weve got to send a clear message to russia and unify our allies
6636066 they cant charge into other countries of course it helps if we are leading by example on that point
6636067 the best defense that georgia could have had would have been a robust system of international law the war in iraq weakened that
6636068 saya ingin menegaskan sekali lagi bahwa tidak ada toleransi bagi kejahatan korupsi di pusat maupun di daerah
6636069 kita harus memastikan bahwa anggaran yang semakin besar ini tidak diikuti dengan semakin meningkatnya penyimpangan missmanajemen apalagi korupsi di daerah apbn dan apbd adalah uang rakyat yang harus dimanfaatkan sebesar besarnya untuk kepentingan dan kesejahteraan rakyat
6636070 gajah mati meninggalkan gading harimau mati meninggalkan belang marilah kita mengemban amanat dan tanggung jawab dengan baik sehingga mengemban nama yang baik pula nama yang akan dikenang oleh rakyat jauh setelah kita meninggalkan jabatan yang kita emban
6636071 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
6636072 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
6636073 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
6636074 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
6636075 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
6636076 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
6636077 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
6636078 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
6636079 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
6636080 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
6636081 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
6636082 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
6636083 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
6636084 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
6636085 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
6636086 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
6636087 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
6636088 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
6636089 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
6636090 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
6636091 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
6636092 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
6636093 there is more enthusiasm for estrogen as the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms
6636094 the concept that women who are post menopausal are a one size fits all crowd is going to disappear soon
6636095 things were so adverse a few years ago that symptomatic women would not entertain the possibility of taking hormones at all no matter how miserable they were from their symptoms
6636096 women can often do the math for themselves when this is discussed and then balance against the benefit that symptom relief provides
6636097 for as long as she feels she needs it for quality of life and she feels the advantages to her outweigh the informed risks that have been individualized for her and her regimen
6636098 i looked back and saw the limbs of my colleagues flying through the air
6636099 even if you have to sit together for a week
6636100 the threat that we are facing today has no precedent
6636101 our enemy lurks silently within our society this is our war
6636102 reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6636103 the future of this coalition is linked to the restoration of judges
6636104 if the judges are not restored we will prefer to sit on opposition benches
6636105 eu transei ate o nono mes de gravidez e se meu marido tivesse falado que nao queria pq tinha medo d emachucar o bebe eu trairia ele pq mulher com tesao e fogo meu
6636106 we feel like both of them have had great camps but kevins going to take the first snaps
6636107 well see how it goes from there nate will play in the game i dont know exactly when but kevin will start
6636108 my first day with the ones was probably my worst practice at camp
6636109 after that i just calmed down and stopped thinking so much and just played football its continued through camp and every day i feel like im getting better and better
6636110 we feel like kevin has the ability to make plays we feel great about nates experience and knowledge and his play making ability as well
6636111 we want to see with the roles reversed how that works were looking for the best chance to be successful its so close its going to continual evaluation
6636112 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
6636113 this is a planning took where all things are going
6636114 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
6636115 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
6636116 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
6636117 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
6636118 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
6636119 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
6636120 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
6636121 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
6636122 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
6636123 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
6636124 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
6636125 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
6636126 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
6636127 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
6636128 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
6636129 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
6636130 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
6636131 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
6636132 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
6636133 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
6636134 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
6636135 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
6636136 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
6636137 its certainly had a tremendous toll on everyone thats involved emotional physical well get through
6636138 if were going to reduce the budget by 100 000 then we can accomplish that
6636139 i think tpac can learn from the model of the topeka civic theater and be self sufficient
6636140 if the council needs 100 000 dollars for another important project then the police department wants to participate in that if it can and that is a line item where we could reduce some expenditures
6636141 were talking about minimal increases that will continue to put the city in a position to grow and provide the necessary services to the people that live here
6636142 tiens regardons un peu les stars qui sont envisag s pour jouer les m chants du prochain batman philip seymour hoffman et johnny depp
6636143 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
6636144 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
6636145 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
6636146 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
6636147 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
6636148 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
6636149 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
6636150 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
6636151 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
6636152 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
6636153 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
6636154 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
6636155 steve condrens uncle told me he is going with the seven in the third
6636156 and here comes peter cottontail coming from the east end parking lot
6636157 typically a 30 year arm that initially offers the borrower four monthly payment options a specified minimum payment an interest only payment a 15 year fully amortizing payment and a 30 year fully amortizing payment
6636158 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
6636159 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
6636160 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
6636161 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
6636162 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
6636163 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
6636164 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
6636165 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
6636166 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
6636167 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
6636168 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
6636169 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
6636170 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
6636171 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
6636172 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
6636173 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
6636174 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
6636175 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
6636176 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

6636181 yes the men came to me but i did not know where they had come from 5 at dusk when it was time to close the city gate the men left i dont know which way they went go after them quickly you may catch up with them
6636182 i know that the lord has given this land to you and that a great fear of you has fallen on us so that all who live in this country are melting in fear because of you 10 we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you when you came out of egypt and what you did to sihon and og the two kings of the amorites east of the jordan whom you completely destroyed 11 when we heard of it our hearts melted and everyones courage failed because of you for the lord your god is god in heaven above and on the earth below 12 now then please swear to me by the lord that you will show kindness to my family because i have shown kindness to you give me a sure sign 13 that you will spare the lives of my father and mother my brothers and sisters and all who belong to them and that you will save us from death

6636184 go to the hills so the pursuers will not find you hide yourselves there three days until they return and then go on your way
6636185 this oath you made us swear will not be binding on us 18 unless when we enter the land you have tied this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down and unless you have brought your father and mother your brothers and all your family into your house 19 if anyone goes outside your house into the street his blood will be on his own head we will not be responsible as for anyone who is in the house with you his blood will be on our head if a hand is laid on him 20 but if you tell what we are doing we will be released from the oath you made us swear
6636186 akulah jalan dan kebenaran dan hidup tidak ada seorangpun yang datang kepada bapa kalau tidak melalui aku
6636187 and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
6636188 si tu le peux mais sans renoncement sois en bons termes avec tout le monde dis ce que tu penses clairement simplement et coute les autres m me les sots et les ignorants car eux aussi ont quelque chose dire

6636207 there are altogether 765 government schools in the state which has a total enrolment of 1 27 726 students the breakup of the same is 61 973 boys and 65 787 girls which indicate that there is no gender inequality in the state
6636208 the department is still continuing vocational educational programme at 2 stage inspite of the discontinuation of the grant in aid by the ministry of human resource development new delhi during this 11th five year plan

6636216 we were all caught unaware by the double standards of the department
6636217 ruben baez godoy v e i du pont et al
6636218 does a complaint in a products liability case suffiently allege that white lead carbonate is defectively designed where the injury causing lead is a prominent ingredient in the lead pigment
6636219 did plaintiff appellant ruben baez godoy allege a cognizable that white lead carbonate was defectively designed by defendants white lead carbonate manufacturers wlc manufacturers when the alleged defect lead is an inherent characteristic of the product at issue
6636220 this case is appropriate for oral argument because it will refine the issues on appeal and highlight the fact that the circuit court and court of appeals were correct in dismissing godoys design defect claim although the law at issue is well settled this case also is appropriate for publication because a published opinion will provide further guidance to lower courts presiding over similar claims
6636221 terrorism is the best political weapon for nothing drives people harder than a fear of sudden death

6636299 hay dos resoluciones sobre la mesa y mi lectura es que el consejo no est en disposici n de respaldar ninguno de los dos
6636300 hay dos borradores de resoluciones sobre la mesa y mi lectura es que el consejo no est en disposici n de respaldar ninguno de los dos
6636301 la resoluci n tal como est ahora no contar con el apoyo de mi gobierno y para nosotros sigue siendo importante que se reafirme la integridad territorial de georgia
6636302 nadie puede considerar que se encuentre cerca de la zona de conflicto
6636303 los seis puntos sin clarificaciones nos hacen temer que se ponga al consejo en la posici n de respaldar algo que no se respeta
6636304 seguro que hay diferencias entre nosotros sobre esta materia pero m s adelante ya tendremos ocasi n de discutirlas
6636305 we see substantial new market opportunities in front of us weve seen studies that put the world market for explosives trace detection systems as high as 25 percent compound annual growth rate with a base market more than doubling to over 650 million per year over the next five years
6636306 in the past year we have significantly expanded our servable geographies introduced a key new product and made considerable progress on our product roadmap as a result we believe the company is well positioned for continued growth
6636307 when does the government plan to unveil details on this grant which is supposed to be implemented starting with the upcoming 08 09 academic year
6636308 the 2008 budget announced this initiative as one measure to help lower costs for students
6636309 what message do you have for students unsure if their textbook purchases will qualify for the grant
6636310 all of the details on the textbook and technology grant will be coming to students in september
6636311 this was not what i was looking for students are encouraged and in some cases required to purchase textbooks
6636312 the primary thrust of my question is to inform my readership of what not to do if they wish to receive the grant
6636313 we will be providing all necessary information to students in september along with the application form
6636314 we want to make sure that all ontario students take full advantage of these new grants to better assist them in affording postsecondary education
6636315 theyve had ample time to figure this out this was the only gift for post secondary students in the budget they need to know how to access it
6636316 wed rather see a reduction in tuition the biggest upfront cost students face is tuition
6636317 remotemdx attributes these increases to the continued market acceptance of its securealert monitoring solutions
6636318 as well as from the successful integration of two acquisitions midwest monitoring amp surveillance and court programs inc
6636319 importantly the trackerpal ii now allows us to not only grow our existing customer base but also to acquire new agency contracts previously unavailable to us both domestically and internationally
6636320 now that we have completed the acquisition of packeteer we are focusing on integrating the two companies into a single organization and reaping the cost management technology and market synergies
6636321 we remain unique with a combination of technologies for wan and internet gateway visibility acceleration and security that solves the growing application delivery challenges faced by enterprises and organizations
6636322 when the stock market is trending downward it is difficult to know what to do amid the uncertainty is the proven benefit of owning dividend paying stocks
6636323 sure the share prices of such stocks and equity etfs can fall but the dividend payments continue to generate income in both good and bad times
6636324 despite the current market gyrations one intriguing new etf that offers exposure to a growth oriented foreign market and dividend income is the
6636325 the new etf began trading on july 16 the fund is based on the performance of the wisdomtree middle east dividend index
6636326 gulf gives investors exposure to approximately 70 dividend paying companies listed in bahrain egypt jordan kuwait morocco oman qatar and the united arab emirates
6636327 if youre worried that oil prices will resume their upward trajectory after their recent pullback the countries featured in the gulf etf should benefit economically from such a trend
6636328 oil certainly is a key commodity for middle eastern countries and their economies but this fund is not dependent on the performance of just one sector
6636329 the funds second and third largest sector holdings are telecommunications services and industrials respectively telecom companies drew 24 56 of the funds assets as of july 29 while industrials took in 11 37
6636330 clearly this fund is diversified in ways that focus on the regions overall growth opportunities and the kinds of companies that will benefit from continued gross domestic product gdp gains
6636331 kuwait is the nation that has attracted the most investment dollars of gulf the fund has put 27 73 of its holdings into kuwaiti companies while the united arab emirates with 18 12 and egypt with 12 69 round out the top three countries where gulf has placed its investment funds
6636332 i am not recommending this new fund right now as it still is trying to build its trading volume to the threshold of 100 000 shares a day that i like to see before pursuing such an opportunity
6636333 you may want to hold off on investing in gulf until its trading volume increases and until we see its price performance for the first four to six weeks
6636334 we have chosen zi corporation again because of the quality of its text entry solutions and superior technical support especially in asia
6636335 we are very focused on developing our strategic base of ip solutions and zi provides us with the text input capabilities we need in asia

6636337 this deal demonstrates the versatility of our input products and the opportunity we have as a company to tap into other similar markets
6636338 three years ago it would have been difficult to imagine a gathering such as this
6636339 the enormity of the task before us is big its huge humongous
6636340 there are between 500 000 and 875 000 cubic yards of uranium contaminated materials at the northeast churchrock mine site alone that must be disposed of properly to protect navajo land and people
6636341 we also know there are contaminated waters from the former shiprock mill site that are entering the san juan river we believe that somewhere between 1 3 million and 2 5 million gallons of uranium contaminated water is leaching out of the shiprock mill site each year thats a lot of gallons
6636342 we know too that there are uranium contaminated waters not only beneath the former tuba city rare metals mill site but also beneath the former tuba city open dump the federal government failed to adequately identify all the vicinity properties associated with former mill sites such as evidenced by what is referred to as the highway 160 site
6636343 back in 1970 something happened to me i couldnt understand that i got what they called a benign tumor it changed my life there had to be something that caused that and lately i got leukemia i still didnt understand that why how
6636344 when i looked into my past we had lived right under a mine and we got exposed that way i didnt understand but i connected it to uranium uranium from the mountain good things come from the mountain but also bad things but back then we didnt know
6636345 where i live they drilled two wells contaminated thank you for telling me how the uranium works to break up the dna strand what i got is what they call philadelphia they told me that the dna is breaking up
6636346 its devastating and were still going through it my grandpa died of lung cancer my grandma died of stomach cancer my aunt stomach cancer 50 000 compensation is just a drop in the bucket im still being treated every day every month other illnesses are starting to come in so thank you for the information
6636347 this is probably one of the biggest issues identified within this five year plan
6636348 grandson you never know one of these days you might get into a position of influence and im going to share with you a truth the truth is that were all on the same side
6636349 because were all families were all relatives it behooves us to make war against the real culprits against the real monster
6636350 hunger famine thirst the lack of water the jealousy the ignorance the greed the apathy that is out there and all manner of disease
6636351 it preys on everybody it preys on the elders as well as the babies thats a truth the sooner we come to this truth the sooner we live this truth the better it is going to be for all of us because the only way you can make progress in the world is to stand side by side and make war against the real monster
6636352 the task before us is daunting its great no one man no one nation or government can hope to put a dent in it because its too big but working together as a people as governments and agencies we have a chance

6636375 her health was as good as when she was taken to that residence
6636376 were thankful that baileys alive shes safe and shes healthy
6636377 given that the substance of all the complaints are the same and those were dismissed we expect the commission will rule the same way that weve acted appropriately and within the law
6636378 i was assured by the investigators that all the complaints were going to be handled at once and i have not been asked for any additional information
6636379 as the investigators told me i believe this matter is closed
6636380 we know that children learn faster when they have different modes of communication
6636381 if they hear the words and see the sign its like a double exposure
6636382 it eases frustration for both her and me because she can communicate what she wants me to know and i dont have to guess over and over
6636383 now i know one more way to communicate with my child
6636384 hes only going to be 3 and i had no idea they could understand signs
6636385 today the complaints against lawyers for professional misconduct are on the rise at an alarming rate and the fiji law society is doing all it can within its limited resources to arrest and reverse this problem
6636386 one of the things we have found is that the complaints are against a small minority of lawyers who have brought disrepute to the legal profession
6636387 i will repeat here that it is the legal duty of the fiji law society under the legal practitioners act to prosecute and discipline its members for professional misconduct and during my term as president that is exactly what i will do

6636396 we need these alternative forms of energy to bring competitive prices and wind will be that competitive price he said

6636437 it is clear that even as farm income remains strong rapid increases in input costs are slowing the growth in farm equipment sales

6636536 i thought i mixed up pretty well tonight and was really solid not giving her many free points and making her work for every point
6636537 i guess i need to get used to being back again in these kinds of situations but after losing that game i really regrouped really well played a good service game and then put a lot of pressure on her service game i tried to learn from a couple of games ago and do much better next time
6636538 she was serving well i think and she has a great slice which i couldnt really handle
6636539 i was missing a lot and couldnt move really well she was good today
6636540 it was too hot in the beginning of the second set i felt a little dizzy but then i was fighting until the end thats why i won

6636555 the geometry of the vertical nanowires which were equidistant and parallel to each other were designed to only respond to the electrical field in light waves
6636556 the magnetic field which oscillates at a perpendicular angle to the electrical field in a light wave is essentially blind to the upright nanowires a feature which significantly reduces energy loss
6636557 natural materials do not respond to the magnetic field of light but the metamaterial we created here does
6636558 it is the first bulk material that can be described as having optical magnetism so both the electrical and magnetic fields in a light wave move backward in the material

6636567 but the moon the nearest to the heavenly influences by the swiftness of her course is joined to the sun and the other planets and stars as a conception bringing them forth to the inferior world as being next to itself for all the stars have influence on it being the last receiver which afterwards communicates the influence of all superiors to these inferiors and pours them forth upon the earth
6636568 o goddess of the moon teach us your ancient mysteries that the holy strega spoke of for i believe the stregas story when she told us to entreat thee told us when we seek for knowledge to seek and find thee above all others
6636569 therefore her the moon motion is to be observed before the others as the parent of all conception hence it is that without the moon intermediating we cannot at any time attract the power of the superiors

6636612 it was john d rockefeller iii who was appointed by richard nixon as chairman of the newly created commission on population growth and the american future
6636613 rather than think of population control as a negative thing we should see that it can be enriching

6636626 we judged it would be too risky for the government to inject additional capital into it if it incurred additional losses
6636627 we are studying a number of options and are open to all possibilities which could include buying lehman
6636628 financially kdb will not have a problem buying a majority stake in lehman as the u s banks market cap has fallen sharply over the months
6636629 the problems however are legal and regulatory issues i am not so sure if the u s government will easily allow a foreign bank to purchase a significant stake in one of its key financial institutions

6636641 i think it is unlikely that the rainfall from fay will alleviate the severe drought affecting the southeast region it really doesnt come down to the amount of rain but the frequency of rainfall that determines the extent of a drought extreme events dump loads of rainwater on an area once the surface soil is full of water though runoff begins most of the water especially in these areas will runoff the groundwater only gets recharged by what drains from the surface soil however you will probably see a temporary rise in lake reservoir levels from the runoff
6636642 government regulation is not an alternative means of protecting the consumer it does not build quality into goods or accuracy into information its sole contribution is to substitute force and fear for incentive as the protector of the consumer the euphemism of government press releases to the contrary notwithstanding the basis of regulation is armed force at the bottom of the endless pile of paper work which characterizes all regulation lies a gun

6636671 para sa gobyernong arroyo ang tinatawag nilang mga bagong bayani ay mga baliw
6636672 sa pagtanggi sa reyalidad na ito at pagpapatampok na gumagawa ng krimen ang mga ofw para ipagtanggol ang kanilang mga sarili sa esensiya ay kinokondena ng dfa ang mga ofw
6636673 kung susundan natin ang lohika ng dfa mga baliw sina sarah balabagan mary jane ramos at joselito alejo at hindi mga bayani gaya ng pagturing sa kanila nang silay umuwi matapos ang pagdurusa nila sa ibang bansa
6636674 isa lamang ito sa mga dahilan kung bakit ang mga migranteng pilipino ay magsasalita kasabay ng gfmd makikipagkaisa ang migrante sa iba pang mga migrante mula sa ibang bansa sa international assembly of migrants and refugees para hamunin ang gfmd na harapin ang katotohanan na ang migrasyon ay hindi magbubunga ng kaunlaran

6636682 on rainy lake there is a cabin that was built 60 or 70 years ago
6636683 its a tax grab at the expense of those who live in or have a cabin in unorganized areas in other words its a tax grab on those who live in northern ontario
6636684 these are people who pay for their own sewage water garbage disposal and things like fire protection
6636685 people oftentimes build their own roads and maintain it as a group
6636686 when you think about it i cant think of anybody whos ever had as big of an impact both on and off the field in the national football league as gene upshaw did
6636687 hes had a big impact on the game and hes had a big impact on a lot of players they young players dont even know there are a lot of guys who have no idea all of the stuff all the sacrifices all the foundational work all this stuff has been done that hes been behind
6636688 we called him the governor when he was a player
6636689 to me that piece cant be replaced the passion that the guy had for the game that he played for a long time thats irreplaceable thats going to be missed

6636707 if the fuel price spirals this year the people need not worry about bearing the high cost as the government will absorb the additional cost
6636708 i cannot say now as our fuel price depends on the price of a barrel of oil in the world market which constantly fluctuates
6636709 we are aware when diesel price increases it will take a toll on public transport and lorry operators nevertheless they cannot raise fares to their whims
6636710 whats happening now is that individuals having five vehicles including those using 2000cc cars are given rebates its not fair
6636711 we give rebates to lighten vehicle owners burden but if they have more vehicles than they should there is no need to give rebate anymore
6636712 no wonder vladimir putin thought it was a good time to invade georgia
6636713 elpiji 12 kg seharusnya mendapat subsidi negara seperti kemasan 3 kg pemerintah bisa segera mengusulkannya ke dpr agar dapat dilakukan pembahasannya
6636714 tujuan program konversi bertujuan mengurangi subsidi negara sekaligus bahan bakar alternatif yang bersih lingkungan
6636715 sebagai bumn pemberian subsidi tentunya membuat pertamina merugi hal itu tidak dibenarkan apalagi nilainya hingga rp6 triliun per tahun
6636716 pemerintah terkesan tidak tegas dengan hanya menyebut elpiji 12 kg sebagai urusan korporat secara lisan tanpa landasan hukum
6636717 bahan bakar yang selama ini disebut dengan tertentu kan yang subsid premium kerosene solar dan elpiji 3kg selain yang disebut tertentu berarti tidak bersubsidi sehingga jelas bahwa pertamina bisa menetapkan harga sendiri
6636718 every year we experience importation of measles from other countries and from those going abroad but this year is different once measles is imported here were seeing it spread to many more people
6636719 many cases are in children who are eligible for vaccination but who have not been immunized because of parents decisions
6636720 we need very high levels of population immunity approximately 95 percent
6636721 we have been lucky to have low levels of measles and other vaccine preventable diseases but children can still get measles and can still spread measles including to those too young to be immunized and those who cant be vaccinated because of medical reasons
6636722 id like to see what its like the feeling the excitement the buzz its a great thing i had chills on my body and i wasnt even part of the team hopefully one day those feelings can actually be real thats where we want to be one day
6636723 they had a great run it was something to watch it was cool to see a team come together like that
6636724 to see them as underdogs and perform the way they did it was a real eye opener i was amazed by how they played
6636725 they got to the super bowl and they got a chance to do it and they succeeded which is good for those guys
6636726 thats where i want to be ultimately im sure a lot of people feel the same way i know those guys personally see them every day and it leaves a bitter taste in your mouth
6636727 adding brett favre two weeks into training camp has been a unique situation
6636728 we have made every effort to be honest and transparent
6636729 congratulations brett on coming to new york welcome he wanted to play ball the big apple
6636730 for me this is the third preseason game and we have to show vast improvement from the second preseason game and that is what i am focused on
6636731 its one game thats actually closer to a real game so it will be interesting regardless
6636732 i guess there are going to be a lot of 4 jerseys
6636733 i heard he is the number one seller again hey its jets and giants cant get no better than that the city loves it bragging rights
6636734 it helped them win the super bowl so its going to be a good gauge for us
6636735 i try to keep all quarterbacks who are behind me healthy
6636736 obviously you want to keep that guy healthy as well
6636737 any one of those guys could have been right up there for mvp of the super bowl they took over the game
6636738 its really going to depend on how many plays we have offensively and how long their first group is in
6636739 with every pre season game ive played in id like to play the whole game
6636740 its kind of a touchy situation but based on how much ive played or havent played i would think i would play more
6636741 we want to really be crisp out there for the third game knowing that we will not likely be out there for the philly game next week this game is going to be as close to a regular season procedure as possible we really want to go out there and make a statement
6636742 they were really impressive against cleveland and they have some really good athletes in their front seven
6636743 we feel like were a pretty good group up front too
6636744 i think we have potential and weve laid a really good groundwork here in training camp
6636745 youre starting to see signs not of life but things beyond just the xs and os its getting to where youre starting to do some things in some pretty difficult situations and being able to get the blocks
6636746 obviously its a new year a lot of things have changed its a pre season game for us im not thinking about the past theyre the team to beat in this league were just trying to get better this week
6636747 you dont want to have a setback this late in the process well just see how it is
6636748 slammed the door in my face and at the time i pushed it back open

6636751 freilich w rde ich den wettkampf am liebsten nochmal wiederholen das war wohl unser bisher schlechtestes ergebnis doch ich habe immer davon getr umt einmal bei olympia zu starten jetzt bin ich ein olympionike also kann ich jetzt nicht entt uscht sein

6636759 given presently available disclosure we have lost confidence in our understanding of bnbs senior debt covenants as such we cant adequately assess the risk of covenant breaches and their consequences and therefore cant adequately assess a fundamental valuation with sufficient certainty to underpin a 12 month share price target
6636760 what a shame bca continue to put their selfish interests ahead of what is clearly in australias best interest
6636761 big polluters always cry that the sky is falling when governments propose schemes to reduce pollution but every time governments hold firm and introduce their schemes the polluters clean up their act and get on with business
6636762 the big question is whether the rudd government has the courage to introduce a strong emissions trading scheme or whether it will buckle to the selfish demands of the big polluters
6636763 there is no hope for an international agreement to reduce emissions if wealthy developed countries like australia do not lead the way
6636764 the special treatment the business council is advocating for trade exposed industries would be to the financial detriment of its other members it should ask its other members if they would be happy paying extra to cover the emissions of trade exposed industries which are given special treatment
6636765 there will only be one or two additional light rail lines in this region
6636766 we just simply dont have the population density and we wont get the federal matching dollars
6636767 and express buses but the dynamics simply dont exist for a huge expansion of light rail we might only have one or two more commuter rail lines in this region
6636768 we at met council support that broader definition of transitways
6636769 weve studied 29 corridors many of which are not eligible for commuter rail or bus rapid transit there just isnt the ridership maybe the only thing that makes sense for them is an express bus route we think that should be allowed under the quarter cent sales tax funding
6636770 we havent decided whether to pursue that but i have weighed in on it in part because id like you guys to come in as payers into the system and i know you wont if you dont get anything back and i dont blame you

6636788 protective orders which govern the exchange of information outside of a public docket are obtained pursuant to a good cause standards
6636789 when such information is filed with a court however it becomes part of a public document subject to the right of public access absent showing a compelling justification and a clearly defined and serious injury
6636790 took place so long ago that there is no likely reason their disclosure would cause competitive disadvantage
6636791 litigants may not seal information merely because public disclosure will be embarrassing or will otherwise reflect poorly on them
6636792 we trust the court can find a way to protect the companies trade secrets without blocking all information on the allegations in this case
6636793 wed also hope that in reviewing our motion the court decides that providing trade secret protection to evidence related to illegal business practices and behavior would be adverse to the public interest
6636794 we are excited about our partnership with hp and believe our clients in the federal state local governments and the commercial market segment will benefit from this partnership all of these sectors are seeking secure and sophisticated collaboration solutions and services

6636862 though there is evidence both for and against the existence of a detectable anthropogenic signal in the tropical cyclone climate record to date no firm conclusion can be made on this point no individual tropical cyclone can be directly attributed to climate change
6636863 numerous hurricane meteorologists agree that the historical data has not produced any evidence of changes due to climate change in the number or intensity of hurricanes particularly in the atlantic basin and even globally
6636864 there are some who have done studies that do claim a link but virtually all those studies have been heavily rebutted by others in the hurricane community
6636865 in my opinion the flaw in those studies is an improper utilization of historical databases
6636866 parties need to have the opportunity to correct technical errors before the accounts are published and the accounts are too complex the forms need to be maximally simplified
6636867 large volumes of funds returned by the parties shows that the requirements for party financing are excessively regulated
6636868 a violation of procedure during an election campaign has to be monitored more strictly during an election campaign with appropriate sanctions up to exclusion from participation in the election
6636869 we have 125 security guards and about 40 police if it gets close some will come from other areas to the ground so if he gets to 98 or 99 goals we will have more security on hand on the ground to make sure everyone is safe
6636870 west coast have been briefed and they know where to mingle if he kicks it the umpires and some of the hawthorn players and the eagles down the other end will have their own separate security guards
6636871 about a year ago we began to sort of wake up to the reality that no matter what your view is of the why the practical fact is theres more water in the arctic for longer periods of time than weve seen in the past
6636872 as soon as you began to see more navigable water you began to see more transit
6636873 more and more nations are exploring china has a vessel in the arctic now and certainly the russians the danes the u s the canadians and others
6636874 all of that has a security implication not that it becomes a threat but its something we have to pay attention to
6636875 do we need ports of call for industrial movement through there that will change the investment strategy that businesses and nations have in that region canada is certainly looking at that they intend to put a military base up in the northwest passage area
6636876 obviously the students are upset and we sincerely apologise for that
6636877 when we found out the students were upset we stopped the work and will only be doing noisy work during the holidays from now on
6636878 distressed to hear of your concerns regarding the level of noise
6636879 they give us ice cream nights when they come and apologise and promise that things will change but they dont
6636880 we werent told what we were getting into we dont want future students making the same mistake
6636881 a builder drilled through a pipe and sewage leaked into some of the rooms it took over a week to get cleaned up
6636882 my room has leaked the entire year they had to move my door back about half a meter so they could drill holes in the concrete in my floor i was leaving for work and they were still there with a concrete drill at 9 oclock in the morning they were wearing earmuffs and i had no protection
6636883 we have constant construction and constant leaks we have had scaffolding in our room for the last two months
6636884 i woke up to see my skylight missing and a builder staring at me through my roof i was extremely uncomfortable so went and slept on the couch
6636885 the never ending construction has disrupted everything i wish i hadnt come here i am going home to get away from this mess
6636886 if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong but if youre like me and you got one house or you are like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home then you might have a different perspective
6636887 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses

6637003 the ps 125 freespace desktop bagger has many unique features

6637030 the debt is selling right now because the bond market thinks the government is going to step in and take over
6637031 if the treasury continues to hold their breath debt spreads will widen back up
6637032 i do not think it government intervention is going to happen this weekend i do not know if it is going happen within the next couple of weeks
6637033 the more the stocks trade down the higher the probability they will have to act i do not think 3 is that trigger point but it is certainly getting there
6637034 if they are able to roll over their debt in late september and the dollar amount is substantial then it signals that the credit markets are comfortable enough with the current situation and with the government backstop and that buys them a fair amount of time
6637035 if that does not turn out well then the treasury if they have not already done so will at that point be forced to step in and act more quickly than they would have
6637036 nobody is going to put equity capital or preferred stock into fannie and freddie with whats the government going to do hanging over your head

6637060 there is no definitive link between the outbreak and the product at this time
6637061 our investigation includes a lot of sampling and of course with regard to sampling and testing that takes time
6637062 its a possibility their illness was caused by that but they also ate other high risk foods for listeria
6637063 so its going to be difficult to ever prove it without a doubt
6637064 the cause of death was not deemed to be listeria
6637065 frankly i think were surprised equally so that this has happened and im not sure blame can be placed on anybody for this situation but i do want to reiterate that sanitation is held to the highest standards

6637267 few interventions have been proved to substantially help patients with chronic back pain in the longer term
6637268 lessons in the alexander technique offer an individualised approach to develop skills that help people recognise understand and avoid poor habits affecting postural tone and neuromuscular coordination the practice and theory of the technique support the hypothesis that it could potentially reduce back pain by limiting muscle spasm strengthening postural muscles improving coordination and flexibility and decompressing the spine
6637269 these simulations show that young stars can form in the neighbourhood of supermassive black holes as long as there is a reasonable supply of massive clouds of gas from further out in the galaxy
6637270 the crucial element was the modelling of the heating and cooling of the gas as this tells us how much mass is needed for part of the cloud to have enough gravity to overcome its own gas pressure and thus form a star
6637271 that the stars currently present around the galaxys supermassive black hole have relatively short lifetimes of around 10 million years suggests that this process is likely to be repetitive
6637272 such a steady supply of stars into the vicinity of the black hole and a diet of gas directly accreted by the black hole may help us understand the origin of supermassive black holes in our and other galaxies in the universe

6637278 i support nigerias efforts to better use oil and gas revenues which together with fiscal discipline and transparency can make a positive difference to livelihoods of the nigerian people
6637279 the uk and nigeria have a close relationship on many issues i hope that this can be extended to the energy field and that this visit can help to further strengthen our partnership
6637280 angie harmon and jason sehorn are thrilled to announce that they are expecting their third child the couple originally denied reports that they were pregnant in an attempt to take back the right to release the joyous news themselves
6637281 no we kind of do our own motor program for our nationwide stuff and our cup stuff its separate from their stuff
6637282 trust me im sure theres a whole lot of things that i dont know and im glad but for the most part with our guys and this team they all understand from the day we started this team in 1991 racing the 1992 season were going to do things a certain way if you cant abide by that go find somewhere else that you can do it its not worth it for us hopefully thats the history that we have i think if you look back thats the way it is so well deal with this and move on its obviously frustrating for all of us
6637283 i think more for the guys they were just frustrated and wanted to make a point like hey we did it and were even farther off than you thought im not sure exactly what would go through their minds because again our guys kind of take pride in winning those engine dynos thats the only time you can take all of those manufacturers lay them out there and say what do you got for us to win that its kind of like a notch in their belt
6637284 yeah once we get back tomorrow and kind of sit down and hash through it i think youll see something pretty quick from our side
6637285 i talked to them nascar i think in years past they kind of looked at the engine dyno thing as hit or miss put it on there but now theyre starting to make rules based off that so i think that becomes a more important piece in their arsenal as to how they keep the playing field level in their mind and a tool i think for them it will be bigger and i dont know exactly what i met with them this morning im sure it will be a pretty big slap
6637286 i think when you go back kind of what we talked about a few weeks ago is heres the box to play in i think our guys have done a really good job utilizing that i dont care if it was gm dodge ford or toyota we invest a lot in that and spend a lot of time on it and so we want to make sure we are on an equal playing field i think there was again some frustration there thats a separate issue a rule is made decisions are made okay move on and lets work on what we have now so to be able to come out of that dyno and have and again come up with the best horsepower that would have been a huge notch for our guys that was the discouraging part
6637287 i probably wont get into that thats all been hashed out a lot in the past weeks im just kind of more focused on what happened here yesterday i would say it definitely cuts you back some and were always working to get it back what we lost we are definitely not where we were we think we were before but i think for us whether they took anything away or not were always working hard to find more stuff
6637288 i think when you look at the big picture you usually go before we were even involved with toyota they had a motor and nascar made them redo it to be eligible to run in the nationwide series that all took place they changed a bunch of stuff now heres a new package it fit within the box now as time goes on youre always going to have new things gm is going to phase in the ro7 and let the sb2 go away the problem you have in nationwide i think the biggest problem in nationwide is financially there are such constraints on what you can do so i think for us heres a package so now you change us and we have to go back and spend more money figuring out how we can get back to where we were i can see jacks roush point nascar says heres some parts for you to use to build new motors hes like i dont want to build new motors that costs too much money which is a valid point so you are kind of stuck in between what you dont want to do is lose sight of our guys that have invested time effort and financially apart from toyota have invested a lot in these motors to get them to where they need to be so thats frustrating i think for us and for every owner out there im not going to say whos to blame thats just part of life weve been through this for 17 years and sometimes you have bodies getting changed years ago thankfully that doesnt happen any more thats to nascars credit were not changing bodies every couple years the motor thing is a big piece and i think nascar has a pretty good box on it our thing is we just want to have a level playing field and go to work and do a better job than the next guy
6637289 we are not going to speculate on that we will definitely field two cars the rest of the year im not sure there might be a race or two where we dont have two cars lined up on our schedule im not sure things will go on unchanged for us on the racing side
6637290 no for what were talking about here its pretty much that would be there own decision it is unrelated to the cup program obviously we have one engine shop that builds motors for everyone but it would be unrelated to any
6637291 ultimately it starts with to me ownership it falls on our shoulders and then youve got management in place and youve got crew chiefs in place i think everyone has a level of responsibility there and it starts with us thats the frustrating part people know how we operate and this isnt it i think the crew chief yeah they are responsible for what happens at that car and at that track if something happens that they dont know about they shouldve known about it so i agree with that
6637292 no our drivers did not have anything to do with this process here
6637293 select t mobile retail stores and umm well actually yes well that would be a well a mmm maybe no the answer to your question more
6637294 it didnt dawn on me until after it was cleaned up but hey we should have done this a long time ago
6637295 police officers arent going to have to respond here anymore
6637296 so we have a tremendous savings in terms of dollars but even a more tremendous success for the fact that we wont have this criminal activity in the neighborhood
6637297 hopefully whats going to distinguish this effort from whats done in the past is a thing called action
6637298 when the tea lady starts to invest in the stock market its time to get out
6637299 most dog fighters are amateurs and know little about conditioning or caring for their dogs many are inner city gang members where street fighting is probably where the worst abuse of pit bulls occurs
6637300 we can finally close the book on this and raul can rest in peace
6637301 were very disappointed by the verdict and believe we have a number of good issues on appeal
6637302 this guy right here irrevocably changed so many lives when he chose to arm himself that night
6637303 raul briseno had too much pride to give in to a couple of punks and he chased them out and he paid for it with his life
6637304 the suggestion that no blood transferred onto that jacket and mr houghtaling was so confident that no blood transferred onto it that he wore it into the police station is totally incredible
6637305 the man as i think we all saw is crazy
6637306 thats the crux of the states case and theres nothing there
6637307 he had no motivation to implicate himself in the crime yet he gave specific details
6637308 i didnt know what to expect but i got ideas for places to perform recording ideas and offers of help and a spirited discussion about rival recording software not to mention ideas for a series of music seminars
6637309 realizar una visita de estado a varios pa ses de europa y lamento que no estar en el pa s para recibirlo porque estar a muy desilusionado de perderme su visita y por la reuni n que espero albergar en el a o 2009 con varios premios nobel le estoy escribiendo para suplicarle que posponga su viaje
6637310 no tiene una explicaci n racional no era una invitaci n oficial hubiera sido lindo que l arias lo recibiera pero no es necesario su santidad visita innumerables pa ses de europa y del sudeste asi tico sin que los reciba el presidente esto no ten a nada que ver con el gobierno
6637311 es dif cil entender qu tiene que ver una actividad del a o entrante con una visita privada para efectos espirituales y culturales por qu ese plan result ser exclusivo
6637312 when he won the position he worked his tail off to not only maintain the starting spot but become the best player he can become
6637313 and thats a unique mentality that young people have this degree of complacency all of us do and our guys push each other to always be great and i think thats helped him hes been a pitcher of that in our program
6637314 this year im a lot more comfortable just knowing i had a decent year last year i kind of proved myself last year
6637315 so its a lot easier to just go make plays instead of trying not to screw up
6637316 i was pained and angered by the atrocities against muslims worldwide and the turning point was the demolition of the babri masjid and the gujarat riots only made matters worse
6637317 if the government does not take early measures to bring an end to undue harassment of muslims who were indiscriminately labeled as terrorists this country is in for another partition so let us be prepared for nation wide riots and violence
6637318 all this talk about creation of indian mujahideen images needs to be probed i would not be surprised if such an organization has been floated by fundamentalist bodies like the rashtriya swayamsevak sangh or vishwa hindu parishad with the sole intention of defaming muslims
6637319 i am not giving any clean chit to anyone but the manner adopted by the investigating agencies speaks of a blatant bias and a predetermined approach

6637668 why am i here well about two years ago i was born in the backyard of some person i cant even recall i had 11 brothers and sisters i recall a day when a big man came and gave that person some money and took me away from my mother they had to chain her up as she was very angry that he took me they chained her and beat her i came to know the man by the name of jim i overheard him telling his friends that i would grow up to be big and mean like my mother but as i grew older all i wanted to do was play and be friends with everyone jim said i needed to be taught how to be mean so he chained me up in the yard no more house for me he said i was too spoiled when people came by to visit i was so happy to see them i wanted them to come and play but that made jim angry so he beat me with sticks and chains when he came near i would roll onto my back so he would know i wasnt a bad dog that made him beat me more
6637669 i am so sorry spartan some people are just plain evil
6637670 i cant say spartan maybe someone kind will come and get you we can only hope
6637671 my owner surrendered me she said she wanted a cute little dog like the one on the tv show frasier she didnt bother to look into the type of dog i am
6637672 i suppose she expected me to just lie about and only need a short walk each day just like eddie but my energy was so high that i needed to run and play
6637673 now i am here i suppose it could be worse i could be like her
6637674 she was found tied in a back yard she only had a three foot chain some days there was no water rarely was there any food one day a nice neighbour came by and brought her some meat by then it was too late she was already mad she broke off her chain and bit the poor man badly we know she will be going behind the steel door i am sad to say i think it will be best perhaps then she will know some peace
6637675 who is that why have all the dogs gone quiet
6637676 compassion love sorrow it emanates from her pores she is here for one of us but nobody knows who just yet

6637684 we love this dog so much and we even bought him a special bed that cost 50 and it is just killing us to part with him but honestly our maid is just awash in dog hair every time she cleans and his breath sometimes just reeks of liver so you can see how hard weve tried and how dear he is to us but we really just cant
6637685 those nice people will take him and find him a good home and everything will be fine

6637701 without that information bm mohamed will not be able to put forward a defence to the very serious charges he faces given the confessions made by him in bagram and guant namo bay in 2004

6637704 keempat yang kami bisa lakukan di dalam masa peralihan kami beri waktu lima tahun untuk negosiasi ulang tapi substansinya jangan dijabarkan dalam uu dan penyelesaiannya ditentukan kontrak per kontrak karena setiap kontrak punya kasus yang berbeda beda
6637705 negosiasi harus tuntas dalam waktu setahun setelah itu bicara implementasi isi kesepakatan itu misalnya berapa royaltinya kapan mereka harus membangun pabrik pengolahannya
6637706 kalau buat saya proses peralihan itu harus dilakukan secepat cepatnya
6637707 karena nantinya akan sulit melakukan perubahan itu kalau tidak ada substansi apa yang hendak diubah setidaknya harus ada item item walaupun tidak detail yang perlu dimasukkan
6637708 ive always felt you cant complain unless you are active and you make yourself heard and you do what you believe in
6637709 they let me run because i was making a point but the actual rules say you have to be 18
6637710 its hard to get past the idea that because of my youth im not as educated or not as serious
6637711 standing up to a 71 year old school teacher i obviously look fairly inexperienced and not as qualified
6637712 it was a great time i have always looked up to sen clinton and president clinton

6637718 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6637719 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6637720 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6637721 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6637722 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6637723 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6637724 im sure our female audience would appreciate it and dont forget the umpires and referees a little black and white striped skintight number with sequins would surely boost ratings
6637725 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6637726 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6637727 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6637728 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against south africa
6637729 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6637730 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that
6637731 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage

6637742 the defence ministry has frozen military cooperation with the alliance
6637743 in the phone call president bush said that the united states is looking for russian compliance with the agreement to withdraw their forces and an end to their siege of georgia
6637744 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6637745 with usain in it its going to be an awesome race

6637804 this has just been scotts year winning indy and winning just about every other race it seems
6637805 i think we all know that ive been surprised to see him kind of beat teammate dan wheldon on a consistent basis and with scott this year it doesnt seem like they can do anything wrong you look at nashville and he missed his pit call and he ends up winning the race
6637806 hes getting the breaks but scott and his team are doing everything they need to get in a position to win
6637807 if theres any guy thats a deserving champion i think its him
6637808 everythings gone a bit smooth here whats going to go wrong
6637809 some little silly thing maybe the engine blows up or the gear box has a problem you get a flat tire i was waiting for something like that the whole race even on the last lap
6637810 do not underestimate the wit or endurance of your opponent

6637814 im confident that with the quality of our people anytime we bring a backup car to the racetrack that backup car should be prepared as if its going to become a race car
6637815 otherwise we shouldnt really have it here at the level we participate at the question will really be if we need to go to a back up car at what state the back up car is going to be in for the weekend
6637816 if theres a team that can rebound from something like this its team penske
6637817 theyve done it before and were going to do it again its tough because you have some small bits seats for example i loved the seat that i had and im going to have to use the spare one little details the car was prepared for here my guys are going to do what they can

6637822 secara total seluruh anggaran ke daerah baik untuk transfer maupun melalui anggaran pemerintah pusat mencapai 65 dari total belanja apbn 2008 besarnya dana apbn yang dialokasikan ke daerah membuktikan komitmen kita semua untuk menjalankan desentralisasi ekonomi secara konsisten dan bertanggung jawab
6637823 muncul kesan bahkan keluhan dari berbagai pihak upaya itu dilakukan secara berlebihan sehingga membuat investasi menjadi sepi dan dunia usaha tidak bergerak saya berharap kondisi seperti itu tidak terjadi
6637824 namun ibarat memiliki ayam bertelur emas telur itulah yang dimanfaatkan dan bukannya ayamnya yang dipotong dengan demikian peningkatan pad dan perkembangan ekonomi daerah terus bergerak seiring sejalan

6637839 a few years ago when i was involved in a project to build broad coalitions of progressive organizations at the state level there was a fad among these groups to do a power analysis of the political conditions in their states and create a plan to build power for their causes and constituencies at the time i wondered wasnt building power what they were doing but the answer was that a lot of progressive organizations especially those structured as nonprofits had been kind of uncomfortable with the idea of power they didnt think in those terms their theory was that putting persuasive information in front of policy makers or getting courts to issue injunctions to stop bad things would be sufficient their counterparts in electoral politics thought winning elections was the end of the fight to the extent they had a theory of power it was limited to the idea that when there was a public decision to be made an election a ballot initiative a piece of legislation someone should mobilize to affect the decision
6637840 i pulled out onto the road i never meant to harm another soul i really didnt unfortunately i have taken another ladys life because of my stupid actions

6637843 i dont think any of us can look back on any one thing and have regrets

6637858 this time the party wanted us as a partner in the process they reached out to us and wanted to hear what we had to say
6637859 the challenge is getting the information right and doing it expeditiously

6637865 what men and women seek most in a relationship is the feeling that the person they are with is absolutely devoted and interested in them and energetically passionate about them

6637884 positive im leaving sorry i texted u that i didnt like 20 min ago
6637885 okay fair enough you should see how completely out of order these texts came in you were gonna cry after you said its cool kind of funny actually may end up a blog stupid technology
6637886 there is therefore no condemnation for those who are in christ jesus
6637887 for the accuser of our brethren has been cast down
6637888 after fifty years the biggest beneficiaries of commercial television had been the advertisers changing the material aspirations and assumptions of two generations and overriding regional and social differences to create much greater conformity peoples television had created televisions people
6637889 i was happy to get charlie back out there hes doing really well right now
6637890 he did a nice job on his rehab its still a day to day thing with him as we go out there but today was a good day we were able to get him some work and get him rushing the passer a little bit and get him involved that way
6637891 thats a position right now where you can never have enough of these outside linebackers that are playing
6637892 for a while there you didnt have even joey porter for a practice then it was charlie not being out there quentin has been the one guy thats been out there each day and has really taken advantage of that that way today was nice to have them all out there on the field getting them practice it is critical and i think at some point theyre all going to have to help us
6637893 its hard because these reps that i missed those are valuable reps and im just trying to get back to rushing again and just working on my craft
6637894 it could have been a lot worst so youve got to look at it like that and just take this time to get in the book and focus on the defense i want to get out there bad but youve got to be smart about this thing
6637895 i have to say conditioning is where i have progressed the most
6637896 being out here and working hard everyday that can be one of your biggest setbacks when youre out of shape and out of condition so ive made some strides as far as that aspect and just getting used to that game atmosphere now i dont think as much with the calls and techniques because youre doing it for so long it takes some of the thinking out and that help you to be a better player
6637897 this afternoon was just something that i talked to coach about it and there are no setbacks or anything like that everything is strategically planned out
6637898 right now first of all obviously we have to go into this game playing anthony fasano and david martin just a little bit more that cuts down on some of these opportunities that we need to look at
6637899 they need to get their work then it becomes this fullback tight end deal after that fasano martin the fullback thats in the game at the time and well rotate reagan mauia and boomer grigsby around during the course of the game
6637900 then we need to see some of these other tight ends and what they can bring to the table in the backfield and all of a sudden special teams comes back into play what can they do there can this guy go into the backfield as a tight end give us some snaps there and play on special teams or is he just going to be a tight end that cant contribute on special teams when i have this fullback that can thats where we need to be
6637901 im just trying to be a complete a tight end and just help this team however i can
6637902 if its lining up in the backfield everyday then so be it thats how its going to be i just want to be a part of whats going on around here and i just want to go out there and work hard and basically do what the coaches want me to do
6637903 o nebuchadnezzar we do not need to defend ourselves before you in this matter if we are thrown into the blazing furnace the god we serve is able to save us from it and he will rescue us from your hand o king but even if he does not we want you to know o king that we will not serve your gods or worship the image of gold you have set up
6637904 our god is able to save us from the fiery furnace we know he will rescue us from your hand yet even if he doesnt choose to rescue us we will never worship your gods or the golden image you have erected
6637905 i thought you only threw three men into the furnace
6637906 there are four men in the furnace and the only things which have burned are their bonds one of them even looks like a son of the gods come out come out o servants of the most high god
6637907 wait a minute itd be more fun to rock some really bad looking wig with chopsticks in the hair
6637908 even if universal is correct that fair use only excuses infringement the fact remains that fair use is a lawful use of a copyright
6637909 accordingly in order for a copyright owner to proceed under the dmca with a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the copyright owner its agent or the law the owner must evaluate whether the material makes fair use of the copyright
6637910 allegation that a copyright owner acted in bad faith by issuing a takedown notice without proper consideration of the fair use doctrine thus is sufficient to state a misrepresentation claim

6637912 last year i played half the year with a broken hand and i didnt even know about it

6637914 we dont have the biggest lead in the world in the division but everyone is getting the itch
6637915 championships are championships no matter what you dont get that many opportunities
6637916 honestly i think we have a legitimate shot at the playoffs
6637917 the starting rotation is very good the bullpen is very well rounded offensively we can swing with anybody i think its a very well rounded team that we have right now
6637918 we have to prepare for the world coming to the arctic
6637919 its amazing to me when i go to the pole how thin the ice is huge open spots of water in some areas
6637920 before you spent more time getting there and more time in the ice wed have helicopters looking for breaks in the water for us
6637921 we have to ask ourselves whether were prepared for these ships coming to our shores
6637922 when everything goes wrong fall time storms tragic loss of vessels lost people on land theres nothing thats ever been so far away than the coast guard
6637923 its affecting our hunting practices in more ways than one
6637924 if you take a step back and look at it you definitely see the changes
6637925 im agnostic to the science and the debate about what the cause is

6637928 you your joys and your sorrows your memories and your ambitions your sense of personal identity and free will are in fact no more than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve cells and their associated molecules who you are is nothing but a pack of neurons
6637929 although we appear to have free will in fact our choices have already been predetermined for us and we cannot change that
6637930 omg if im just a pack of neurons i have much bigger things to worry about than behaving on this experiment
6637931 democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely antiwar ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul

6637950 why is it that every child that comes into contact with him is broken
6637951 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6637952 i thought things would go the justice way but justice is fickle i guess

6637955 what we have accomplished in this agreement is the most advanced version of any
6637956 because the u s negotiators indeed showed a great deal of flexibility and understanding
6637957 we recognize that the government still has to review this agreement and well await that process and then it obviously has to go to the council of representatives
6637958 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6637959 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6637960 this agreement determines the principle provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of the u s forces
6637961 were not sitting here talking about an agreement to try to get out of a bad situation
6637962 builds on the success we have had in the last year this agreement is based on success
6637963 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6637964 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6637965 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6637966 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6637967 no wait im totally a hummingbird just having a little snack here mmm tasty

6637974 pembubaran tidak efektif karena fpi memiliki basis dukungan internal dan massanya sangat fanatik
6637975 fpi akan muncul kembali dengan memakai nama yang lain tapi dengan pengurus dan anggota yang sama
6637976 terbukti selama rizieq dipenjara dalam kasus pelecehan institusi kepolisian gerakan fpi jauh lebih
6637977 saya lebih tertarik untuk memahami bagaimana pola relasi reproduksi nilai dan relasi kuasaberlangsung di dalamnya dan pada saat yang sama mengungkap sejauh mana identifikasi mereka dengan islam
6637978 demokrasi tanpa otoritas melahirkan anarki fpi harus dibaca dan dipandang simtomatik dan patologi masyarakat karena ketiadaan otoritas sehingga mengakibatkan demokrasi yang ambruk
6637979 contohnya pendekatan motivasi agar orang tertarik dengan fpi ada juga pendekatan kognitif berupa ide fiqih dan tauhid sehingga fpi lahir dari individu yang merupakan sumber identitas diri

6637982 im lightning bolt i am not flash gordon or anybody my name is bolt lightning bolt
6637983 to halt international military cooperation events between russia and nato countries until further instructions
6637984 for all practical purposes military to military cooperation had really already been ended with the russians
6637985 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6637986 we still have some very important issues that we need to work with russia on
6637987 its a whole series of things that are not very important theyve got important sounding titles but reality of that nato russia council is they look for things to talk about
6637988 theres plenty of agenda items but theres not much substance in them
6637989 getting justice dignity and compensation for survivors of childhood sexual abuse is what matters
6637990 smacks of collusion and secrecy on the part of both catholic and secular authorities
6637991 hoy podemos hacer del mundo un infierno y estamos como ustedes saben en el mejor camino para conseguirlo

6637998 las verdades elementales caben en el ala de un colibr
6637999 hacernos cargo de las cosas nos permite avanzar la culpa es una nueva posibilidad que otorga la vida y uno puede convertir una culpa en un xito personal
6638000 puedo amar y mi amor por t puede sobrevivir y no s lo eso puede vivir y mantenerse con una fuerza mayor que la fuerza del tiempo y de la muerte porqque el amor esmetatemporal y no sujeto al parecer
6638001 go for what you want and fuck what anyone else thinks about it
6638002 happy is he who works and plays and doesnt know the difference
6638003 when you can wake up in the morning and still feel the imprint of your womans arms around you youre invincible no one can touch you
6638004 most people are more concerned with what you think of them than what they think of you
6638005 leader of one leader of many if i cant lead one i cant lead any
6638006 number one productivity you wont be happy if you dont produce the game of life is not rest we must rest but only long enough to gather strength to get back to productivity
6638007 friends are those wonderful people who know all about you and still like you
6638008 the truth is incontrovertible ignorance may attack it and malice may deride it but in the end there it is
6638009 the mind is a toy not a master have fun with it
6638010 the mans job is to advance its her job to try and stop him
6638011 the womans job is to try and change him its his job to not let her
6638012 the goal of class and seminar rooms is to eventually have the students in the back gradually move towards the front till eventually theyre the trainers then the trainer leaves and someone else takes his or her place the cycle continues
6638013 leave a legacy build something from the ground up and be able to leave it running sufficiently on its own
6638014 resolve says i will the man says i will climb this mountain they told me it is too high too far too steep too rocky and too difficult but
6638015 in the amount of time it took for you to complain you couldve already finished it
6638016 i found it easier to get rich than to make excuses
6638017 dont mistake the finger pointing at the moon for the moon
6638018 let no one ever come to you without leaving better and happier be the living expression of gods kindness kindness in your face kindness in your eyes kindness in your smile
6638019 your family and your love must be cultivated like a garden time effort and imagination must be summoned constantly to keep any relationship flourishing and growing
6638020 its only a mistake if you dont learn from it
6638021 some of the worlds most beautiful works of art started as a mistake
6638022 you cant be old and wise if you arent young and crazy
6638023 so many coaches come from outside of the school system as much as 60 75 and in many cases the age of coaches is getting younger
6638024 yet they have in many cases zero training to work with kids as a result there have been a spike in the number of inappropriate relationships
6638025 i dont know of any states that require psychosocial training
6638026 were hoping that no law is required to get this done
6638027 theres no draft of legislation but we see that a lack of training is available
6638028 we have to learn to crawl before we can walk
6638029 hes the most unique player ive seen in the six years of scouting for rivals
6638030 he has tremendous tools hes long extremely fast and a deft ball handler
6638031 demarcus can wheel and deal from just about anywhere on the court
6638032 he can post up he has a pure power game and he can pull up and shoot the three derrick excels at blocking shots and cleaning up the glass derrick is a better defender
6638033 its like what would happen if there was no final four the basketball season ending with just conference champions
6638034 it was a tremendous game to snap our losing streak and it went right down to the wire
6638035 we knew people were writing about it everywhere now we want to win a couple more
6638036 i just try to take care of things i can control
6638037 every guy in that room knows we can hit better
6638038 well see how he wakes up tomorrow morning but he may be doubtful for sunday
6638039 its disappointing we have got to see the extent of what hes done but if there is any risk he wont play sunday
6638040 im not saying bad liverpool teams ever won the league of course they didnt but maybe a few years ago you could afford to carry a few players
6638041 i dont think thats possible now every position has got to be filled by a top player if you want to win things on a consistent basis
6638042 the fact that the manager hasnt bought in loads of new players shows he has faith in the squad it hasnt changed much at all from last season
6638043 the year before last we finished with 68 points and last year we got 83 which represents a big step up we can all learn from the mistakes we made last year and hopefully go one step better this time
6638044 we need to put fire in anelka tell him look anelka you are very good maybe this will be the season for anelka
6638045 i need to work more on his head on his thinking in the field because he has good quality
6638046 we speak about it quite often neither of us started well and we used to say we wanted to leave
6638047 we can laugh about it now because we have both reached 100 games
6638048 tottenham fans are no exception to any others they support the team and get behind the side
6638049 if a player is on form if he knocks in a couple of goals then im sure anyone who booed him last week will soon be getting behind him and cheering him

6638066 it was a combination of things and they all came together to cause the move we saw today
6638067 speculators are in the drivers seat and theyre driving our economy right over the cliff
6638068 is going to hit the u s consumer squarely in the wallet in a day or two
6638069 this russian thing is significant if in fact they dont leave
6638070 by occupying the country the operators of those pipeline facilities may choose not to operate them because the risk is too high
6638071 you have this contrast between supply concerns related to russia and demand issues related to weakening economies
6638072 its going to be somewhat of a tug of war
6638073 texting while driving is so obviously unsafe that its hard to believe anyone would attempt it yet everyday observation suggests there are an awful lot of folks who do
6638074 there is already sufficient law that can be applied if someone is driving while distracted
6638075 we dont need a law for every thing a driver does the next one is going to be you cant drive while you are eating a hamburger
6638076 using an electronic wireless communications device to write send or read a text based communication
6638077 i will give every ounce of my energy every ounce of my intellect to work with you to work with the people of california to accomplish great things
6638078 the government is not giving attention to this at all
6638079 its so involved in this quagmire on the judges its not paying attention to the real challenges the country is facing and terrorism is the most important challenge facing this nation
6638080 is it our war or is it somebody elses war why are we being made to kill our own people
6638081 it is going to get worse and worse and the time will come where the entire nation of pakistan will say get out america
6638082 i dont really know i hadnt really thought about it just being together with her was almost as if almost almost like a drug
6638083 thats perhaps an extreme way of saying it i just wanted to live an obscure life in baltimore
6638084 i was given to me by the one person to whom ive always looked up to one person whom ive known since i was small
6638085 i really couldnt tell you perhaps at some point we can do a dna test and find out
6638086 i never said that stated that in any specific way one way or the other
6638087 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6638088 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6638089 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6638090 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6638091 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6638092 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria
6638093 on doit pas avoir la m me notion de la qualit
6638094 ouais enfin etant quand meme un minimum conscient du risque il aurais pu justement ne pas

6638099 youre getting 600 what can you do with that it may even feel good that first month when you get that check and then you go out and you buy a pair of earrings
6638100 it forces better service or lose customers and could lower profits
6638101 basically we are giving people a choice as to which company to use
6638102 i will generally be looking for things such as composition design rendering and sense of color etc
6638103 of course being that there are many category levels in the show these will be judged relative to category level it is difficult to have all of these qualities in one painting however in my experience a good painting will have many of these if not all to some extent
6638104 one more important quality that i like to look for is a good feel for the medium such as execution or brush rendering
6638105 it will put some money in our general funds so we can work on our drainage our water lines and sewer
6638106 its only a donation we didnt increase our utility rates at all this year because were trying to keep everything low
6638107 with everything going up so much and everyone having such a tough time were trying to keep the rates where they are and not overburden folks if we can help it
6638108 in our budget we dont have a lot of extras we have enough to cover basic services to the people and i think we do an excellent job with what we have
6638109 it doesnt take a rocket scientist to know what the benefit could be
6638110 lng is a global commodity and you pay a global price
6638111 we would see significant losses on a cargo purchase if we sold it at a domestic price
6638112 the gas prices are much better in europe and in asia so we will hold the gas in the tanks until the market gets better in the u s
6638113 we would bring ships in unload the liquid nitrogen in the tanks and send them off
6638114 helping to ensure the continuing operation and availability of u s energy infrastructure at times when global market forces may not otherwise support deliveries of lng to the united states
6638115 we believe that this capital investment combined with our recent restructuring and significant reduction of annual expenses will provide us with sufficient liquidity to operate our business for a minimum of three years whether or not we are successful in our plan of securing cargoes or additional third party long term terminal use agreements
6638116 the housing situation is a complete disaster and will just continue its downward spiral
6638117 if you want me to estimate how much time id say a couple of weeks before you see a major pullout
6638118 if they ask you to get a russian visa if you want to travel from washington to baltimore thats what it looks like
6638119 we considered it officially as an unacceptable development in paris

6638387 the team is definitely on a high right now believing we were going to make a statement in the whole tournament
6638388 it didnt start like we wanted to but we just kept digging and getting better each game it was a full team effort and it was so special with everyone doing it together
6638389 when i was 6 years old i thought i was the only girl in the whole world who played soccer i wasnt allowed to play because i was a girl
6638390 back then i could never imagine to be a professional player or a professional coach now im sitting with a great player christie rampone and looking at her gold medal i am so proud
6638391 i have no idea why we cant win a final
6638392 its something im gonna keep asking myself for a long time you keep asking what you did wrong
6638393 again we had a chance to win the gold and again we let it slip away its hard to say why that keeps happening to us
6638394 in so many games before we were able to score easily but today it wasnt the case
6638395 we said dont worry about making mistakes just go out there and play with confidence and be brave you could feel it every minute of that second half and in overtime we felt strong
6638396 est acontecendo com o paulinho o que j aconteceu com outros

6638400 our prognosis was that basically that she could have surgery but would be out until at least january
6638401 instead she opted for twice weekly cortisone shots and a months worth of physical therapy

6638403 weve recommended that cindy use more tongue as it takes the pressure off of the performance of the upper lip

6638405 shaking hands kissing babies thats what being president is all about
6638406 you cant be president if you cant do that its time to mend fences with the ex wife and get her into the game his presidential hopes rest on it

6638410 we detected a missile launch from iran on august 16 and our reports indicated it was unsuccessful

6638412 then they dragged it to a closed tent and all the while they dragged it it was flapping its tail blowing out of its head and moving and trying to get away
6638413 it was so upsetting because euthanasia is meant to be an easy death and that whale did not have an easy death at all
6638414 that was the best way it could have been done
6638415 to an untrained person it might not look like the most fantastic thing but you cant get a better result than that
6638416 i was there it was done with as little stress as possible to the animal
6638417 the animal when they first got it and sedated it was very quiet very still we brought it onto the beach where it was euthanased by the vets
6638418 a very measured responsible approach to try to save it
6638419 all our experience that orrca has with cetaceans in this situation is that they very easily get stressed and a very quick dont think about it response is not the way to go
6638420 you need to gather your information talk to as many people as you can and thats exactly what national parks did

6638432 after recently being asked by the england management to reassess my retirement from international one day cricket ive decided to join englands squad for the natwest series after careful consideration
6638433 its something i have been thinking about for a period of time and due to recent injuries in the england camp the opportunity has arisen for me to play a role in this series
6638434 i decided to retire from englands odi team for a number reasons one being the amount of time i was spending away from my family
6638435 now that my family is settled and my bowling is settled i feel i have something to offer englands odi side and am looking forward to playing a part in the natwest series against south africa
6638436 having missed out on selection at various times this year i am well aware of the disappointment that comes from not being a part of the england dressing room
6638437 with that in mind i want to be a part of the team and if that means bringing myself out of retirement to play a role in this upcoming natwest series then im happy to do just that
6638438 at the moment my focus is on doing well in the odis against south africa and im not looking beyond that at this stage
6638439 es decir contrario a lo que a veces se dice que se esta queriendo acabar con lo que voluntariamente aportan los padres de familia no es as porque estamos buscando como se mantenga y se profesionalice

6638443 its had a couple of rallies up toward these levels and its just failed mr vrondas said
6638444 i think todays move is just a little bit of profit taking really
6638445 if we see some demand for euro against the us dollar when europe steps in then that will probably help the aussie mr vrondas said
6638446 it appears as though the market is still relatively buoyed at the moment on the back of the performance in commodities
6638447 we might see a bit more of a pullback in the us dollar
6638448 one of the key reasons for the success of the chevrolet cobalt and pontiac g5 is the lordstown workforce and the strong partnerships with the uaw and local and state officials
6638449 based on the quality of work and these strong partnerships we are pleased to announce our plans to invest another 500 million in the chevy cruze product program in the u s including more than 350 million in lordstown
6638450 the cruze will build on the already successful chevrolet cobalt cobalt xfe and cobalt ss all of which are nearly sold out in dealer showrooms
6638451 our dealers are asking for many more cobalts than we can build
6638452 the chevrolet cruze was designed and engineered by our global teams in europe and asia pacific and will be manufactured in those regions in addition to the assembly plant here in lordstown ohio
6638453 our goal for the chevrolet cruze is to lead in fuel economy in this very competitive car segment
6638454 ours is behaving in a similar way were actually looking okay he said
6638455 its been led mainly by the resources the banks were lagging and now the banks have picked up
6638456 with usain in it its going to be an awesome race

6638460 as per the order of the supreme head of the armed forces on friday august 22 at 6 00am local time 1200 aest all russian forces will begin their withdrawal from georgian territory to south ossetia
6638461 over the course of august 22 the retreat of all these forces in georgia will be completed
6638462 only the russian peacekeeping soldiers in numbers required to ensure security will remain within the limits of the security zone at specially installed posts
6638463 the defence ministry has frozen military cooperation with the alliance
6638464 in the phone call president bush said that the united states is looking for russian compliance with the agreement to withdraw their forces and an end to their siege of georgia
6638465 i cant imagine a circumstance right now that we would engage in military cooperation with the russians until the situation in georgia is resolved
6638466 this is a win win proposal for unitholders to unlock value now compared to the price the market has been prepared to trade their units
6638467 at the same time it allows unitholders to maintain exposure to the core investment strategy of the fund
6638468 the board believes that it is in the best interests of all unitholders to de list the fund from the asx and to introduce a series of redemption facilities to provide unit holders in the fund with liquidity should they desire it once the fund is de listed
6638469 we are confident that the proposal provides a value enhancing solution for our unitholders
6638470 it balances the interests of unitholders who wish to redeem from the fund in the short term while preserving the integrity of the underlying investment strategy for unit holders who have invested for the long term

6638483 when staff did a go around of the aircraft after landing they discovered that one of the left hand tyres wasnt fully deflated but it obviously had some cuts on it and there was mud on the aircraft
6638484 there was not permanent damage to the aircraft and no injury to passengers
6638485 because there was only damage to the left hand wheels it would be incorrect to say that the aircraft totally left the runway there was nothing wrong with the right hand wheels
6638486 left the runway and blew a tyre and scraped the ground

6638501 but on some other stuff they are very impressive there is no fear in them for the fight they have that warrior culture
6638502 they seem very keen and they are very proud and they obviously want to make a difference in their own country
6638503 it will be very much a staged handover with the dutch major mccammon said

6638529 i think it would be pretty cool to be the last guy to hit a home run in this ballpark
6638530 i think that the odds of that are pretty slim to none
6638531 but even to hit a home run here in my last at bat here would be awfully special
6638532 i am hoping to get a seat with a number 10 on it
6638533 id also like to get something blue and orange and something that says shea stadium on it

6638535 we both liked the name and it just seemed the perfect name
6638536 it was just right to name him after this place

6638538 it saved my life i was underwater and it floated me to the top
6638539 if it wasnt for that the boat wouldve took him right down he wouldve went with the boat and that wouldve been it
6638540 anywheres in the river here if theres a wake and you hit it just right with a boat you can be in trouble
6638541 its a different feeling so it will be good to see
6638542 its just another day something new as far as getting back every day is big just waking up and not feeling pain
6638543 i actually like it for home run calls the bottom line is to get it right
6638544 if a ball is a home run it should be a home run if its not it shouldnt be

6638562 that was the best way it could have been done
6638563 its a tragic end to a program that dozens of people have put their hearts and souls into
6638564 it was a sad moment but it went quietly to sleep
6638565 vets who euthanased the animal said it was a smooth operation and the sedated animal remained stress free and calm throughout
6638566 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6638567 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6638568 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity
6638569 for gods sake its a baby its been through hell it was separated from its mother its been starved and confused
6638570 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin
6638571 that was a scene that we witnessed and then they towed the whale behind their national parks and wildlife boat it looked like a scene out of the antarctic with a japanese fishing boat

6638586 the changes in the 2008 finance bill simplified capital gains tax by ending taper relief and indexation allowance and introducing a new single rate of 18 shares purchased between march 1982 and april 1998 no longer benefit from the indexation allowance for which there was a rate for each month in that period as a result shareholders who have held shares for a long time are being unfairly penalised
6638587 the abolition of any accrued rpi indexation allowance in the 2008 finance act has retrospectively made purely inflationary gains between 1982 and 1998 liable to cgt
6638588 in order to address this and in keeping with the governments cgt simplification agenda apcims is calling on the government to introduce a further reform to move the base date from when gains are computed from 1982 to the value of the shares in march 1998 this would allow long term investors to uplift their cost base some of which is purely inflationary gains it would also overcome the problem of how far back a clients records need to be kept and the various cgt identification rules that were in place in the first half of the 1980s

6638656 i dont know of any states that require psychosocial training
6638657 were hoping that no law is required to get this done
6638658 theres no draft of legislation but we see that a lack of training is available
6638659 we have to learn to crawl before we can walk
6638660 hes the most unique player ive seen in the six years of scouting for rivals
6638661 he has tremendous tools hes long extremely fast and a deft ball handler
6638662 demarcus can wheel and deal from just about anywhere on the court
6638663 he can post up he has a pure power game and he can pull up and shoot the three derrick excels at blocking shots and cleaning up the glass derrick is a better defender
6638664 it was a tremendous game to snap our losing streak and it went right down to the wire

6638674 vets who euthanased the animal said it was a smooth operation and the sedated animal remained stress free and calm throughout
6638675 i dont understand why they didnt let it die quietly
6638676 it was obviously distressed im 41 years old and almost collapsed
6638677 after this comedy of errors of the past few days i thought that they would euthanase it with some dignity

6638679 we had five minutes and during that time they euthanased poor colin

6638735 we had seen other places do this in the past and in the recent present and we werent satisfied that they hadnt included more than just the richmond area
6638736 so we wanted to not just have a contest but have something that will be known on the east coast as being one of the biggest and best competitions
6638737 one of the judges adam the hurricane hinkle normally wins the other competitions around richmond
6638738 the first place winner of this competition the grand prix in summer 08 will then go on to compete as the number one contender against adam when we hold this again in the fall

6638744 her and i were talking a lot about our teams
6638745 we probably all were inspired in a way by tessas mom anna
6638746 shes also a great coach so im always excited to talk to her
6638747 i havent really thought of that but i guess people may think her mother went to the olympics she automatically has to be be good but i dont really look at it as pressure i just do the best i can
6638748 they worked just as hard as we did basically we have both the same bragging rights
6638749 i look at basketball as soccer with your hands only on a smaller court
6638750 in both games you have to create space you can make a drive to the basket or a one on one run you have to find the open man i think basketball helps me a lot with my vision on the field
6638751 there are no words to describe his love and commitment to this game there are a lot of schools looking at him
6638752 occasionally youll be put in a situation where you want to do something but you cant
6638753 if im needed in a spot ill try to take over
6638754 we have a different setup this year which will hopefully allow us to move him up more
6638755 but we will also have him in back when we need some help on defense last year defense was the key for us but we want to push the ball up a bit more this year
6638756 as a forward i have an idea what the defense might do because i know what i would do
6638757 as a defender i have an idea what a forward might be looking to do i think it helps me a lot in cutting off the angles

6638767 its not a problem for me because to me the importance of that play was it helped put us in the super bowl
6638768 that play helped put us where we needed to be thats what that meant to us it helped us go into the super bowl against an undefeated team where we were victorious
6638769 i was able to read the route and i was able to undercut it and make a play on the ball
6638770 i dont know what he favre was doing because im trying to watch the receiver every time i see the ball in the air i hope its mine i used to play receiver so hopefully i try to go up there and get it at its highest point and not allow the receiver to catch it
6638771 i was able to get my head back around and play the ball in the air and secure it and helped get us to the super bowl other than that i dont remember much that was months ago it was cold i do remember that
6638772 even when he was taken off of the starting team he was the no 1 guy on the sideline helping the secondary talking to them
6638773 so when the opportunity came again he was very much into the game he knew exactly what the game plans were what the expectations were because he had stayed so involved in it hes always had great hands and he had a chance to utilize those hands in the playoffs
6638774 hopefully ill play a lot longer and make some more plays
6638775 maybe i can forget about that one and make some bigger ones
6638776 its not a problem for me because to me the importance of that play was it helped put us in the super bowl

6638786 donald will be hard to replace on both sides of the ball
6638787 the best thing donald did was his decision making was sound we have to see who picks up the offense the best and it is possible we could use two or three this season or maybe use certain packages for each one
6638788 he doesnt get excited too easily and he has an air of confidence to him he looks pretty good throwing the ball right now and we like the way he runs the option i think he controls the huddle and the field very well
6638789 if he is not the quarterback then he will probably see some time at tailback
6638790 he is a good athlete we can use him at wide receiver and running back if we have to
6638791 the best term to come to mind is he is a little bit of a gunslinger
6638792 he will take a chance and try to squeeze one in he has a little swagger to him he has been working a little bit in the secondary and if we had to he could probably play wideout
6638793 they will get equal reps and scrimmages will mean a lot i dont think we will make it through the whole year with one of them in a perfect world my quarterback doesnt play defense so that means we could go with mike but we will pick the guy who gives us the best chance to win
6638794 donald will be hard to replace on both sides of the ball

6638804 you would like to have it relatively quick with some things but again lets see who separates if they dont then well have to go from there and make a decision on what we have to do

6638921 when i pitched it out its this multi layered incredibly involved universe with a comic tie in an official fan club a charitable organization that would help the environment
6638922 i wanted it to all come out once it became a hit like heroes on nbc

6638931 its easy to see why bloggers and people on twitter may skip using tinyurl or another url shortening service when they can conceivably make money by using adjix
6638932 however the ad frame could easily annoy their readers followers
6638933 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
6638934 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay on for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
6638935 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible

6638950 snapshots also play an important role in building fault tolerance scenarios when combined with managing applications using elastic ip addresses and availability zones
6638951 one of the criticisms of ec2 when it first launched was the inability to run a fast data store across snapshots which made running databases or other data intensive applications slightly more complicated

6638971 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6638972 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6638973 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6638974 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6638975 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6638976 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6638977 im sure our female audience would appreciate it and dont forget the umpires and referees a little black and white striped skintight number with sequins would surely boost ratings

6638984 that is a no no in most cases when you go from larger to smaller pipe
6638985 theres a lot of things in the street department fund that gets spent but its not always seen
6638986 basically i think its not just a cosmetic repair and its not a maintenance thing
6638987 its a structural problem that the state probably needs to take a look at

6638989 yeah well im sure they caught it from my arms
6638990 youre not losing your eyesight its just that when youre in front of a computer all the time as you are your eyes become accostomed to only focusing at that particular distance

6638992 and you hold it close to your face forcing your eyes to make the words come into focus no youre really not a candidate for laser surgery at this time because your prescription from three years ago is very different from the one im giving you today your eyes are uh changing too much for laser surgery

6639051 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6639052 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6639053 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6639054 we ask them at the end of every inning whats the score they say 0 0

6639057 ive always quoted let us not love with word or with tongue but in deed and truth
6639058 their love for each other has deeply moved everyone at the lakehoma church
6639059 it has raised the bar on how to obey the command to serve one another in love
6639060 i mean im from massachusetts this is about as far as you can get me out of my comfort zone
6639061 just the fact that we moved here when we did and everything just happened with rachel and i just happened to be the same blood type

6639070 access and manage your email contacts calendar photos and files at me com
6639071 you do qualify for scholarships and things like that but even going through the university is not enough you are still having to pay 1 000 out of pocket
6639072 so it is a lot easier than paying that big old chunk at one time because you got books and books run about 150
6639073 it just makes better sense and when you look at it the classes are cheaper here you are getting the same education the teachers teach here and some teach at unlv too so its no difference really
6639074 money in the system explanation just doesnt make economic sense but too long to explain ive attached a diagram of the mccain obama tax plans by income bracket
6639075 he was a nice kid a friendly guy he didnt get into trouble

6639084 thats the thing coaches ask all the time tell us when hes going to be back we want that answer too but its impossible
6639085 there are certain things you need to be on the field to see
6639086 right now theyre throwing the whole playbook at us and they want you to remember it all what they did the first day they might not bring it back up again until today and im like man i dont remember all this
6639087 hes a physical man and we just want him to have a speedy recovery so we can get him out here on the field
6639088 were going to need that guy because hes definitely a workhorse the guy is a great back
6639089 i think its a little more slow progress than we all thought it was going to be
6639090 maybe ed has a sense of that at one time because hes the guy that feels it were still optimistic that hell be there the first week but i dont think you can say definitely right now
6639091 we continue to have doctors look at him because we want to be absolutely sure
6639092 its not just about his ability to play in a game right now nobody thinks hes at risk in any way but we want to make darn sure thats the case

6639101 the subprime mortgage crisis has had a ripple effect throughout our national and state economies
6639102 citizens are now feeling the pinch in everything from home sales to classroom sizes
6639103 were heading into a tense difficult time with the economy
6639104 this isnt just a cyclical downturn this is a structural long term change in the economy
6639105 states cant afford to do that cut benefits right now especially at a time when they have their own budget problems
6639106 the states were caught by surprise at the extent of federal regulation and the lack of federal money and theyve been dealing with that ever since
6639107 its size and scope is so massive that it cries out for a federal solution
6639108 states care a great deal about what kind of people will get appointed to these positions
6639109 it always matters a lot to states who the president is because it can determine how much service gets delivered
6639110 the president plays a big role in setting a tone for the state federal relationship

6639125 the people of this village have been wary of the coalition forces for the past several years because they have seen units come and go and promises made that were never fulfilled
6639126 we wanted to assure them that we were different and to help prove our resolve we lived among them in their impoverished community experiencing for a short time the life they have always known
6639127 one of our main goals at this point is to put control of all future developments into the hands of the iraqi people
6639128 we want iraqi people in charge of iraqi projects using iraqi money and iraqi workers as soon as possible which will further stabilize the country and allow our forces to withdraw
6639129 no matter how big or small our operations might be we remain dedicated in our efforts to help the iraqi people gain a new life
6639130 despite the best of intentions it is impossible to change the minds of everyone but every little bit helps each new gesture that makes a difference is another step closer to permanent change
6639131 when i talk to my family and friends back home they want to know what its really like over here and if we are truly making a difference
6639132 each time i have explained to them the kind of change they have not witnessed yet battles and lethal operations have long ago ceased to be priorities our focus now is a return to normalcy living and working and interacting with the iraqi people positive changes are happening every day they might not be big or flashy but they are making lasting improvements that have already put victory for the iraqi people within their reach

6639136 we wanted to take a big step forward making a strong design statement for chevrolet products around the world

6639138 the cruze redefines value with its design quality materials and great style inside and out
6639139 the fit and finish for gaps and interfaces sets a new standard for this segment in europe
6639140 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6639141 this agreement determines the principal provisions requirements to regulate the temporary presence and the time horizon the mission of u s forces
6639142 i have to say if i could just make the point the reason we are where we are going talking about this kind of agreement is that the surge worked iraqi forces have demonstrated that they are strong and getting stronger
6639143 this decision agreement is a sovereign one and iran and other neighboring countries have the right to ask for clarifications there are clear articles that say that iraq will not be used as a launching pad for any aggressive acts against neighboring countries and we already did clarify this
6639144 true there is not much of trade between our two countries my main task will be to work on that and explore economic opportunities
6639145 i felt excited when watching the opening ceremony of the beijing olympic games and the audience in the birds nest national stadium that night must have been overwhelmed by the strong visual impact of the performance
6639146 with advanced modern technology the opening ceremony of the beijing olympics has successfully displayed chinas time honored history and splendid culture to the world
6639147 chinese athletes have won the most gold medals from the beijing olympic games so far which has brought international honor to china
6639148 the organizational work of the beijing olympics is excellent the advanced sports facilities and stadiums in beijing have proved to the whole world that the city has the capacity to organize olympic sports events
6639149 the birds nest itself is a splendid piece of work which demonstrates the chinese peoples wisdom power and technology
6639150 the gold medal also shows that mongolian athletes can compete with those of other countries in the international sports arena and make outstanding achievements
6639151 it should be political in its orientation and talk about what we in the democratic party have really achieved in the west if you take a map and just look at where democratic governors have succeeded republicans its pretty dramatic
6639152 thats a good pictorial of how you can think about what democrats have done out here
6639153 i probably talked about abortion in ninety to ninety five per cent of my calls
6639154 hes smart but hes not uppity hes a down to earth everyday guy which is very important out here
6639155 weve hit for the last three and a half years we have a lot of the same guys i know they can hit but i cant exactly tell you when were going to get going
6639156 quite frankly i think this proves the only method that works is enforcement
6639157 they want amnesty they want open borders and they want a more vulnerable america
6639158 my hope is it isnt going to empower them or fuel their enforcement even further
6639159 as the retrieved goods were in big quantity they were taken back to the president house in three trucks

6639162 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded on to a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
6639163 this is a massive failure of duty it is not the first time that the government has been shown to be completely incapable of protecting the integrity of highly sensitive data
6639164 the government is very careful as they are doing this as a restoration in light of their failure to lift the case in the supreme court
6639165 it is strange that this should be an object of judicial decision because it is premature
6639166 there was supposed to be a signing of memorandum of agreement last august 5 in kuala lumpur
6639167 that did not happen because it was overtaken by a temporary restraining order issued by our supreme court
6639168 acer aspire one fun with ram upgrade and linux distros

6639172 the pullback of russian forces is taking place at such a tempo that by the end of august 22 they will be in the zones of responsibility of russian peacekeepers

6639174 the most important is hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one 30 and you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength 31 the second is this you shall love your neighbor as yourself there is no other commandment greater than these
6639175 you are right teacher you have truly said that he is one and there is no other besides him 33 and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength and to love ones neighbor as oneself is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices
6639176 i am not sure if bush knows any other way to do life with people than this way he is a compassionate and caring individual you can be assured when he says that he really wants to love on people he means it in the sense of truly diving into their lives i have been a recipient of such love and grace from him and as a result i can now consider and call him a great friend he gives the benefit of the doubt in all circumstances and longs for true community amongst believers and those who dont yet believe in fact in the honesty of the matter my assumption from observing him live would be that he really longs more for that community among those who dont yet believe that is no offense to those that do but he is more focused on being like christ than like any individual church he understands that love takes relationship and time but is quick to build that bridge to both as mr bushs representative i would highly encourage all who read this to try and model your life after his and his families why you may ask well because he is trying to model his after christ
6639177 when those people become christians they tell others about jesus
6639178 we were created by god for good works that we should walk in them
6639179 we are utterly resolute in our determination to support this new democracy of afghanistan

6639181 we have succeeded in winning back territory the longer term solution is that more power will be given to the afghanistan people
6639182 you are the heroes of our country you are the frontline against the taliban what you are doing here prevents terrorism coming to the streets of britain
6639183 this week we are celebrating the olympics where we have had great success people have been winning medals in areas where we have been breaking ground but this week also i believe that our olympic athletes and everybody else in our country will remember that you have showed exactly the same courage professionalism and dedication you make our country proud every day of the week every week of the year
6639184 it shows we do have support for what we are doing it gives us a sense of pride
6639185 plotting in the cabinet is not new it happens in afghanistan too
6639186 arming syria would lead to a strategic change and could destabilize the middle east and the world
6639187 we are indeed prepared to sell only defensive weapons which do not violate the regional balance of power
6639188 why in the world would we need to deploy our missiles in syria against whom we have no enemies in the region
6639189 we understand russias stance regarding the breakaway regions and understand that it came in retaliation to georgian provocation
6639190 the timing of assads visit is very important it happens at the time when russia is very angry at the united states
6639191 it is highly possible that russia being so angered by the west and the united states now may sell something very nasty to syria

6639193 they rehman and wali are mediating and we hope they will come up with a solution
6639194 the president and prime minister reaffirmed their mutual support for going after these extremists that are a threat to both pakistan the united states and the entire world
6639195 the government is not giving attention to this at all
6639196 its so involved in this quagmire on the judges its not paying attention to the real challenges the country is facing and terrorism is the most important challenge facing this nation
6639197 is it our war or is it somebody elses war why are we being made to kill our own people
6639198 it is going to get worse and worse and the time will come where the entire nation of pakistan will say get out america

6639492 the phone will ring and itll be romo and ill maybe not answer
6639493 i told you that you looked dorky without a beard
6639494 at a previous meeting i said all the issues and processes were going through its all happened before in 81 and 82 its history repeating itself
6639495 we were not successful then in persuading the decision makers in adelaide and unless we do something different this time we are not going to succeed
6639496 we have to find an alternative site to the port that is acceptable
6639497 we believe we have found a far superior site south of whyalla
6639498 when you think about all these constraints another thing is if we are going to get the best value from a port we need it in a spot where not only miners from up north can use it but miners from eyre peninsula can use it
6639499 our product penetration in the chinese market is currently very widespread and this latest deal with one of the worlds top handset manufacturers again highlights the development and reliability of our text entry portfolio we are delighted that samsung has chosen our bundled solution for two handsets and the combination of handwriting recognition and keypad input is something many oems are really starting to take advantage of
6639500 the government believes it can better relate to the concerns of the whyalla community by setting up its own small high level steering committee rather than taking up the opportunity offered by the council to join the task force
6639501 i thought they would have been only too eager to be included in councils task force
6639502 it seems that they will go their way and i will continue to drive our community task force in a good direction
6639503 we will continue on in a normal manner and do it on our own if we have to
6639504 it is proposed that the mayor and the wedb chairman will be members of both the steering committee and councils task force and will provide a strong and immediate link between the two groups
6639505 the seniority of the members of the steering committee will ensure that the communitys concerns can be considered at the highest levels of government
6639506 the filtration system has the potential to filter microorganisms up to five microns

6639508 especially considering the spencer gulf is home to the most desirable seafood in the world and has one of the most pristine environments
6639509 it has some of australias most diverse seagrasses and salt marsh communities and 90 per cent of the plants and animals are unique to this area
6639510 why should we risk something so valuable when there could be alternative locations
6639511 the dvd has been issued to all councillors for the opportunity to view it and show them what point lowly means to the people
6639512 golf is not bad but as prices are unstable and the economic situation is not getting better president lee thinks they need to consider public sentiment

6639514 police are waiting for further definitive results in relation to the positive screening tests before any action can be taken

6639518 the real impact is that organizations of all sizes now may choose work loads that is portions of their data or certain office locations where cloud storage is appropriate from a cost availability risk perspective
6639519 many applications will benefit from the use of amazon ebs any application that can benefit from reliable block storage can benefit from amazon ebs
6639520 but there is no question that the public has to decide
6639521 this is the most promising thing ive seen in a while
6639522 whether they are going to threaten microsoft much less google thats another story
6639523 if it turns out that they have good relevancy i could see that the word of mouth
6639524 we are moving to a google that knows more about you
6639525 it was a big boar a wild woods hog around here folks call em piney woods rooters or tusk hogs due to their long sharp cutting tusks they call em razorbacks up in arkansas
6639526 that was a pretty bad beating broken nose fractured ribs possible concussion plus the lacerations and abrasions with all that especially the ribs i thought you might want him kept overnight for observation in case there was internal bleeding
6639527 good thats what the book says to do but this is where it helps to know your patients hell be too sore to go anywhere tomorrow and his mother will make sure he comes in on monday for a check up as for the ribs the x rays indicated theyre just cracked with someone young like that boy the bones still have some give the sort of lick he must have taken would damn near kill an old coot with brittle bones like me
6639528 according to that group with him it was a kick not a lick which reminds me who were they
6639529 eli i believe youve just had your first encounter with the rhodes family let me see theres rocky dusty and mac adam the tall girl with them was their sister connie creek the patient was a cousin i think
6639530 nope their fathers real name is rufus but hes always been called rough that inspired him to name his kids after roads if hed had anymore there might be muddy rutted and asphalt running loose
6639531 why do you know so much about them they come in all the time
6639532 its a small place word gets around no the whole family must be healthy as horses i delivered all of them but ive only treated one hed gotten torn up by a hog
6639533 rough and his tribe live way back in the middle of nowhere around there people let their pigs run free in the fall folks use hog dogs to round em up for butchering to mark ownership they notch the pigs ears in a distinctive way kinda like branding cattle
6639534 rough has a reputation well deserved im told for pig stealing during the summer hell lure or chase young pigs onto his place trap em and then re notch their ears so it looks like his mark sometimes the rightful owner will notice this and id guess youd say re re notch the ear thereve been some hard words over roughs habit but so far nobodys been shot at least not that i know of people say that by the fall some of those poor porcines have nothing but stubs where their ears should be
6639535 it must have been about ten years ago when rough and that brood of his came in here
6639536 none so rough looked around and the first kid he saw was mac adam who had the disadvantage of being both the youngest and smallest now i grant you its not saying much but even back then mac adam was about the smartest one of that bunch he proved it that day by telling his daddy he didnt believe going in after that pig was such a good idea said hed had a pretty good look at whatever it was that ran into the briars and that to his way of thinking it was a lot bigger than that shoat they were after
6639537 well rocky started ragging on mac adam about being a sissy who was afraid of going in after one little pig and calling him a little baby and well you can imagine the scene my guess is mac adam just waited until rocky paused to catch his breath then he said something like okay rocky since youre so brave and all why dont you go in there and show me how its done that sounded good to rough he didnt care who went in just so long as someone did before rocky could think of something to say rough ordered him to crawl in among the briars and chase the pig out into the light of day
6639538 now even though rockys dumb as his namesake rocks not the fighter i dont blame him for not wanting to crawl into a briar patch for starters its a hot sweaty slow job you have to get down low and no matter how hard you try some briars are going to scratch you and catch on your clothes besides the ticks and red bugs theres always a chance youll come across fire ants or a snake and once you flush the pig youve still got to get out of there
6639539 yep the old rock had talked himself into the deal and couldnt figure out a way to talk himself out so armed with his daddys snake stick he started crawling in the ones left outside say they could follow his movement by all the noise and cussing
6639540 turns out mac adam was right what theyd seen going into that briar patch wasnt the young pig theyd been chasing it was a big boar a wild woods hog around here folks call em piney woods rooters or tusk hogs due to their long sharp cutting tusks they call em razorbacks up in arkansas no matter what the name theyre big mean and dangerous and young rocky garaziano rhodes had just come face to face with one of them deep inside a briar patch
6639541 luck although by the time he managed to escape that hog had worked him over pretty good and i suppose it might have killed him except for his one bit of good luck when the hog charged rocky jabbed it in the eye with the snake stick that must have made the hog even madder but it stopped that first charge before it could get back in gear rocky somehow managed to turn around so his boots were toward the hog
6639542 when they brought rocky in he was cussing and squawling and bleeding all over the place everybody there had to help hold him down so we could get him cleaned up i decided to give him a sedative cant remember what along with a tetanus booster ive got no idea how many sutures i used on that boy and all the while roughs complaining because the pig got away
6639543 oh yeah whats a bare knuckle bar fight compared to a run in with a wild boar hog in a briar patch now tell me the truth eli are you sure you still want to be a country doctor
6639544 we are trying to push the players to use skirts and also nicer shirts not the shirts that are made for men but ones with more curves
6639545 some players are already wearing skirts i think its a good idea the game already looks more beautiful than before
6639546 although the skirts are just a small part of the changes they may spark a revolution by changing the image of table tennis
6639547 it might be a revolution if women paddlers wear skirts during games just like tennis and badminton players which will definitely help win back the lost interest in the game
6639548 dont get me wrong as a healthy red blooded male im all in favor of table tennis women wearing more attractive clothes
6639549 but im not in favor of them being pushed or coerced into wearing outfits they arent comfortable to play in and how about the men why not bring in compulsory lycra bike pants instead of the baggy shorts many men wear currently
6639550 im sure our female audience would appreciate it and dont forget the umpires and referees a little black and white striped skintight number with sequins would surely boost ratings
6639551 to reach the required 285 000 signatures is difficult enough but the final result shows that an extra 25 000 signatures have been attained this is evidence of just how strong the opposition to this law is
6639552 the evidence is pouring in that good families are being both persecuted and also prosecuted with eight prosecutions for minor acts of physical discipline in a recent six month period
6639553 the rate of cyf notifications has sky rocketed yet actual cases of child abuse found are remaining the same and in some areas like the waikato actually falling
6639554 the anti smacking law has failed miserably you know a law is flawed when it fails to address the problem it was supposed to and implicates good families in the process supporters of the law are trying to herald its success because they incorrectly claim nobody has been prosecuted but we actually want a law that works and catches actual child abuse
6639555 the only reason the law was passed in the first place was because the two major parties were whipped to vote for it which is a little ironic in itself being an anti smacking law
6639556 the government is not giving attention to this at all
6639557 its so involved in this quagmire on the judges its not paying attention to the real challenges the country is facing and terrorism is the most important challenge facing this nation
6639558 is it our war or is it somebody elses war why are we being made to kill our own people
6639559 it is going to get worse and worse and the time will come where the entire nation of pakistan will say get out america
6639560 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6639561 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
6639562 writing on our wall even more serious than the bloody riots of the last two weeks
6639563 the attraction to be stupid is a very powerful collective force but there
6639564 the attraction to be stupid is a very powerful collective force but there are alternatives those who follow the controlled media in adherence to this government however have succumb to stupidity
6639565 we now declare martial law we are now officially evil
6639566 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6639567 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6639568 ignorance and obscurantism have never produced anything other than flocks of slaves for tyranny
6639569 those who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it
6639570 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
6639571 6 when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it
6639572 i heard you in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked so i hid
6639573 who told you that you were naked have you eaten from the tree that i commanded you not to eat from
6639574 the woman you put here with me she gave me some fruit from the tree and i ate it
6639575 6 when the woman saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye and also desirable for gaining wisdom she took some and ate it
6639576 i heard you in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked so i hid
6639577 who told you that you were naked have you eaten from the tree that i commanded you not to eat from
6639578 the woman you put here with me she gave me some fruit from the tree and i ate it
6639579 hey honey stop pruning those roses for a minute and try some of this
6639580 susanna is in the roman catholic canon it is daniel 13
6639581 apocrypha that is books which are not regarded as equal to the holy scriputres and yet are profitable and good to read
6639582 as to the apocriphe bookes i omit them because i am no papist as i said before
6639583 as the church reads the books of judith and tobit and maccabees but does not receive them among the canonical scriptures so also it reads wisdom and ecclesiasticus for the edification of the people not for the authoritative confirmation of doctrine
6639584 that sounds a bit steep what can i get for a rib
6639585 cheer up sleepy jean oh what can it mean to a daydream believer and a homecoming queen
6639586 striking how unqualified obama is and how this whole thing came about within the democrat party i think it really goes back to the fact that nobody had the guts to stand up and say no to a black guy
6639587 i think this is a classic illustration here where affirmative action has reared its ugly head against them its the reverse of it theyve theyve ended up nominating and placing at the top of their ticket somebody whos not qualified who has not earned it
6639588 its perfect affirmative action and because of all this guilt and the historic nature of things nobody had the guts to say well wait a minute do we really want to do this

6639610 i feel terrible i tore up their truck thought i almost had it saved i fought it fought it fought it and ran out of talent i guess
6639611 if camping world became the sponsor of the trucks the company would have to consider whether to continue sponsoring the east and west series
6639612 nascar is focused on finding the best partner to continue to grow a series thats important to the sport and our fans

6639619 this guy right here irrevocably changed so many lives when he chose to arm himself that night
6639620 raul briseno had too much pride to give in to a couple of punks and he chased them out and he paid for it with his life
6639621 the suggestion that no blood transferred onto that jacket and mr houghtaling was so confident that no blood transferred onto it that he wore it into the police station is totally incredible
6639622 the man as i think we all saw is crazy
6639623 thats the crux of the states case and theres nothing there

6639667 somebody asked john mccain how many houses do you have and he said im not sure
6639668 ill have to check with my staff now think about that i guess if you think that being rich means you have to make 5 million and if you do not know how many houses you have then it is not surprising that you might think the economy is fundamentally strong
6639669 let me be very clear i am not questioning his patriotism i am questioning his judgment i am questioning his judgment
6639670 voters think by almost two to one that he has been more negative in his mccains campaigning that barack obama
6639671 having said that however we know that in our business voters always complain about negative campaigning but it also works and so the great irony here is that despite the fact that mccain is seen as overwhelmingly running the more negative campaign people think that what they have heard about barack obama is more negative than what they have heard about john mccain and this is an example of a situation where negative does work
6639672 then he took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing of the people and they said

6639767 the women athletes we had in these olympics were in total compliance with the age requirement
6639768 since asian bodies are not the same as westerners there have been questions but there shouldnt be
6639769 given that there have been some discrepancies regarding her age that have come to light we have asked the fig to look into this matter
6639770 it is because of these discrepancies that we have asked for this investigation to start
6639771 the chinese gymnastics association registered its athletes in complete compliance with the requirement of the international gymnastics federation

6639782 we were completely supportive of whatever ron decided to do
6639783 the audience has a personal connection with him and had he not just shown up on the air people would have asked questions
6639784 ron is a big part of a lot of peoples lives on saturday night with hockey night and the olympics and other major events and people feel a connection
6639785 hes been dealing with his moms situation for a while but hes pretty private about it and doesnt talk to anybody about it and hasnt really made it a focus
6639786 i think in his mind he wants to give so much to the show that whatever it is he wont let that get in the way
6639787 but hes also a soulful type of loving man so im sure hes dealing with it in his own way i thought his announcement was handled gracefully
6639788 i just hit the gate again and i hit another girl in the air and lost control of my bike and just crashed
6639789 its going to be a bummed out time for the family
6639790 so you got these incredible suggestive tainted interviews and who takes over the interviews the woman who has custody of the three children
6639791 in light of the large number of raids and the devastation theyre bringing to immigrant communities in this country
6639792 what we have witnessed is that the police action of ice against immigrants has divided the community instilled fear in our streets disrupted the everyday life of good people and separated family members innocent of any crime from one another the secretive detention of those arrested has further complicated the situation
6639793 as religious leaders concerned for our people we would be negligent of our pastoral duties if we didnt speak out against those unjust government policies and practices
6639794 and they didnt know if they would be swept up in some raid
6639795 because the parents were afraid to send their kids out and if the parents got swept up detained deported they might never see their children again
6639796 now when we get involved in that area the ability to practice their faith that becomes a concern for me right away
6639797 we recognize a lot of them are here illegally but keep in mind many of them are here because the system itself is broken weve gone two decades with this current immigration policy that has enabled and allowed this situation to develop people who came here did not come here with the express purpose of breaking the law they came to make a living for themselves and their families and the government has allowed that to happen because of the lax interpretation of immigration laws and the fact that there hasnt been enforcement
6639798 he would not sweep into a community gather up large groups of people separate family members one from another and deport them to another country i know for sure he would not do that
6639799 while we have great respect for bishop tobin and his colleagues we believe their congregations and communities would be better served by helping individuals to comply with the law or working to change those laws rather than asking law enforcement agents not to enforce it
6639800 while we fully intend to continue to enforce the law i would stress that we do so professionally and with an acute awareness of the impact that enforcement has on the individuals we encounter
6639801 it does call for i think a change of law by the federal government i dont think the executive order helped anything i think it brought lots of negative attention and i think that that went hand in hand with the raids did it cause the raids i dont think so
6639802 the bishop says and i support him that this is not helpful its stirring up fear among people who are undocumented but also people who are documented its lending itself and people may be not willing to admit this but its further prejudice against people of color
6639803 i think the bishop is saying its a very shortsighted answer to a greater problem
6639804 there have been bishops who have spoken out against raids but the opposition has been if theyre going to conduct them its got to be in a way to prevent separation of children from their parents and to ensure that the rights of those who are arrested are protected during the legal process
6639805 a lot of the tactics being used by ice in these raids are really to terrorize and traumatize these people
6639806 its understandable that there might be some ice agents that have reservations about how these raids are being conducted
6639807 and then we have our network with us all the time
6639808 have never met us and dont even know us you hear things about communities falling apart but here in north kingstown its a community that just rallies
6639809 right away friends and family tried to figure out what they could do
6639810 its not all just for us people needed to feel like they were doing something
6639811 i have a very strong faith a very strong catholic faith
6639812 put my faith in god a higher power and then i dont waste my time having to worry
6639813 if you had to pick georgias form of leukemia known as all out of a grab bag youd pick that one its the most curable
6639814 this whole thing has just kind of helped us see the good in everything
6639815 there are seven suspects that we have arrested within the syndicate which is famous for using women as their couriers
6639816 the supply came from the golden triangle in thailand and from afghanistan
6639817 the prudent thing would be to enlist the help of the media and tell homeowners make sure your animals have flea collars
6639818 its an abrogation of responsibility and its a violation of the public trust
6639819 the sooner you let everybody know the better it is for your ability to control the disease
6639820 it leaves us absolutely vulnerable and damned near unable to respond a bioterrorism event
6639821 if i lived in austin i dont think i could trust my health department to do the right thing to protect my family and myself and if i was in practice there i would think golly gee did i miss this in some of my patients
6639822 we didnt get a good handle until the last four weeks
6639823 its aggravating to be that ill and not be tested for typhus
6639824 our charges are based on existing evidence and the accounts of witnesses
6639825 munirs exposure led the former kopassus chief to lose his job which he had only held for 52 days not to mention putting an end to his military career
6639826 the authority that the defendant held gave way to various means of compromising the deceaseds activities which puts him in a difficult position
6639827 why should we be forced from our house while our attackers can walk freely
6639828 we the community of kampung pulo demand the campus be closed and dissolved
6639829 people are still tolerant but there is a growing suspicion among muslims of others
6639830 the state has some responsibility for this growing intolerance namely by not upholding the law
6639831 how can you study here i only followed 20 percent of my last lesson its difficult to concentrate
6639832 these guys are giving me a valuation of over 300k and we didnt even have a powerpoint to show them
6639833 but why should god be subject to his own rules
6639834 to argue that miracles are a normative part of the christian life is in effect to deny the existence of miracles

6639837 i feel like credit card companies target us because we really have no financial awareness
6639838 were barely out of our homes barely having experiences as adults and they throw these things at us and they dont make you aware of what youre signing into
6639839 there was a great sense of disappointment when we lost that game last year and i think that disappointment has turned into determination to get back there and win it
6639840 the beginning of the season is always a very interesting time because you never know what youve got
6639841 thats going to be a strength of ours its that experience that really helps you out
6639842 top to bottom its probably one of the most talented rosters weve ever had
6639843 and that means there is competition for every place and those players who are on the field know theyve got someone breathing down their neck and those who are on the bench know theyve got a shot if all goes well
6639844 a lot of people are going away from the convenience stores because it doesnt seem permanent it seems like just a place you pass through so we wanted to make it a more homelike place
6639845 customer numbers were down despite positive food and service reviews
6639846 our three seniors will do a great job for us this year theyre ready to lead
6639847 they understand whats at stake they have been anticipating their leadership role and want to do it they understand that the young players need mentoring guidance and friendship
6639848 it wasnt as bad as i thought it would be im not much of a small talker and i dont think she is either i was a little nervous because i hadnt seen or talked to her in 14 years
6639849 everyone was making it out to be such a big deal that i think we both fell prey to having that affect us
6639850 i think it will be ok were both grown women both professionals once we were working it felt like a good fit
6639851 everybody was on pins and needles and sort of waiting to see how theyd react they started off kind of tentative but by the time we were five takes in they were giggling and seemed to be reconnecting
6639852 i know shannen probably doesnt share the feelings that i have for tori but i love tori like my sister
6639853 i hope it turns out to be a really great show just for my dads legacy i was originally a part of
6639854 weve been working since the first morning meeting weve been going full speed ahead
6639855 especially making it to the bowl game and not finishing we want to make the big dance this year thats what were shooting for this year
6639856 its like comparing apples and oranges because last year at this time we would have been in our fourth day of school but we havent even started school yet
6639857 we brought in a huge class in 2004 over 3 900 students and we have been successful in graduating them
6639858 and now they are gone and we have been bringing in smaller classes
6639859 the central administration has cut freshman scholarships by 40 percent bgsu simply isnt creating the access that was the hallmark of the ribeau years
6639860 in these tough economic times bgsu has reduced support for students and other institutions like university of toledo ohio university and ohio state university are providing better scholarships and enrolling the students that would have come here
6639861 we have a strong group of returning women and three solid freshmen in saisha galliard sally jerop and agnes kibor
6639862 we will have a lot more depth this season and i have very high expectations for the team
6639863 this year were really excited to have everyone healthy and ready to go this fall
6639864 men have a solid group of returning athletes and add six new athletes this fall
6639865 which gives us a total of 14 runners and a lot more depth than last fall
6639866 our big focus will be on developing stronger front runners and being consistent
6639867 to go that far and get a taste of what it was like has definitely made us more determined to get back there
6639868 we have a good group of guys that are capable of going very far this should be a fun year
6639869 we definitely feel that the strength of our team is all of the talent we have coming back
6639870 we return all of our forwards except for one and we have great leadership at the fly half position with nick viviani returning note email address will not be published
6639871 we had a better team than that obviously we didnt play well
6639872 were going to have a young team this year we lost jace walker
6639873 jace was very talented and played very well for us last season
6639874 matt and john amongst others are going to have to step up
6639875 its a big hole to fill but i dont expect it should be a problem with the guys that played well this summer
6639876 we lost four guys that we were pretty important to our team thats going to be pretty tough to overcome
6639877 but we got two incoming freshmen and hopefully they can come in and contribute right away and were thinking they will
6639878 he had minor surgery and will train this afternoon so fingers crossed hell come up
6639879 he needs to train to assess whether hes ready to play and im sure theyll give him right up until game day
6639880 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
6639881 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
6639882 being the voice of the students we try to tackle some of the large issues
6639883 it was one of the top issues that students have
6639884 the new stop was purely the work done by student government
6639885 this is new to us and we will probably have to do a lot of improvisation
6639886 this is a message i never imagined writing but the time has come
6639887 there will be a lot of expectations for us about key decisions but ill also be preparing the environment so it is the best possible situation for a new leader
6639888 she is as wonderful today as she was when i worked with her in the past
6639889 i have appreciated her commitment to what learning and education mean on a residential campus and her articulation of how all of us at the university need to be engaged in students experiences
6639890 she definitely was a hit with student leaders at their annual student leaders retreat aug 11 13 and i know they are excited to work with her
6639891 were not a program that i think other teams have on their schedule that theyre looking forward to playing
6639892 we can take our momentum from the spring season and bring it right into the fall
6639893 hunter van houten is doing a great job of leading our team this year
6639894 due to the circumstances maybe theyre playing a year before we really wanted them to
6639895 we lost some people but we see that as another challenge
6639896 honestly it was a challenge for the younger guys to step up
6639897 its an unfortunate situation but the coaches recruited around it
6639898 i wish they were still here but you have to move on
6639899 ive tried to have a better relationship with the younger players so i can know where theyre at
6639900 if theyre going through something i try to catch it before it gets worse
6639901 when you have the trust of the leaders then all you have to do is play
6639902 the intent was to make it convenient and easy not to make people feel nickeled and dimed for a basic necessity
6639903 my brother is in college and he always brings his laundry home
6639904 im going to be able to do my laundry and not have to pay for it each time
6639905 sometimes i wait to do laundry because i have no money
6639906 there is no way that i will do my laundry once a week
6639907 nathans our best clearance player so its extremely important that hes playing this weekend
6639908 its a difficult one to answer at the moment because you just dont know how long its going to take with him
6639909 particularly in the past hes had some injuries and we just dont want to risk bringing him back early
6639910 it was amazing that all five of them stuck together for five years of their careers
6639911 year after year they got better and better and we just called them the five blocks
6639912 they finished to the whistle and thats something i aspire to do when i get older and now
6639913 the original blocks are always going to be the original blocks
6639914 the offensive line is one of the strengths of this program and it really has been through the years
6639915 its going to be big shoes to fill but im here to make my own shoes
6639916 its not necessarily filling in shoes for kory but its filling in shoes for all the seniors that left
6639917 especially in these tough economic times because people are getting back together
6639918 the new attitude in this adult world was nobody owes anybody anything after you are 18
6639919 i said the heck is that and there was an alligator floating by
6639920 i took my flashlight and was like youve got to be kidding me a big old alligator swimming around here
6639921 they are trying to find dry land someplace to hide
6639922 were pulling in our plants and porch furniture making sure we have our supplies and gas for the generator
6639923 i still think we all need to stay on our toes
6639924 im ready to get back to work this is insane itll drive you nuts being stuck like this
6639925 qu bueno que pude conocer lo que es el rafting
6639926 this is the next frontier in assuring workplaces are safe
6639927 unless some kind of miracle happens i dont see it
6639928 its going to be a long game if he keeps making throws like that
6639929 you dont have anyone breathing down your neck to do your work or even go to class thats a good thing and a bad thing
6639930 no one likes to be nagged but sometimes you need it to get motivated
6639931 my best friend just moved to cincinnati from orlando and now im moving up to school so i feel like she thinks i am abandoning her
6639932 my biggest fear coming into my freshman year was not knowing if the professors were good at letting us out on time and knowing i had a class in five minutes across campus
6639933 i think the team all learned a lot from our seniors over the last couple years
6639934 they helped build a true foundation for the program and were great example for the underclassmen
6639935 she is very athletic and brings an impressive tournament background to our team
6639936 because we only have six players this year i feel that we all have an opportunity to meet our individual goals
6639937 were all really excited to get out there and show what we can do as a team and individually

6639947 im writing a blog post about feminism do you have any views on the topic
6639948 it has a bad rap for being bitchy bossy women with no fashion sense that are trying to be men i do not think that is true
6639949 the way that we provide feedback is really not the hey good dog
6639950 its the calm tone of voice reassuring the dog that thats nice behavior and trying to keep them calm and doing the things that we want them to do
6639951 shes a squirrel chaser she thought her job was to chase squirrels
6639952 a lot of the behavior that people dont like is really a dog just trying to do a job its a dog that thinks it should be doing something barking at the neighbors they can be very anxious and thats because they think thats what they are supposed to do dogs love having something to do
6639953 from an owner perspective what i want people to do is really have high expectations for their dogs behavior and to really expect good things
6639954 he gave me confidence to be the one thats in control of the dog molly was in control of me and now im in control of the dog
6639955 its not about training the dog its about training the owner basically ive been officially trained by curtis

6639964 takes a surprising turn away from what the conservative press would expect from head and his spiritual awakening and takes an in your face gritty but very honest look at the depths to which individuals will go to satisfy their drug alcohol addictions or other vices wrapped with footage of real life stories and overlayed with other innuendo head s performance steals the picture and will answer anyones questions as to whether he can still rock as hard or harder than his earlier days in korn the literal message in the final screen will get viewers thinking long and hard about any pre conceived judgments they have about those in society typically viewed as losers

6639969 we have agreed that some goals some aspirational timetables for how that might unfold are well worth having in such an agreement
6639970 the scope of these protocols varies but generally suggests estimating only direct emissions and emissions from purchased energy with less focus on supply chain emissions in contrast approaches based on comprehensive environmental life cycle assessment methods are available to track total emissions across the entire supply chain and experience suggests that following narrowly defined estimation protocols will generally lead to large underestimates of carbon emissions for providing products and services
6639971 without a full knowledge of their footprints firms will be unable to pursue the most cost effective carbon mitigation strategies

6639980 for a people who are free and who mean to remain so a well organized and armed militia is their best security
6639981 the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free country
6639982 large and permanent military establishments which are forbidden by the principles of free government and against the necessity of which the militia were meant to be a constitutional bulwark
6639983 a british king whose government sought to quell the fires of revolution with a heavy hand
6639984 god forbid we should ever be twenty years without such a rebellion the people cannot be all and always well informed the part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive if they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is lethargy the forerunner of death to the public liberty and what country can preserve its liberties if its rulers are not warned from time to time that this people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms the remedy is to set them right as to the facts pardon and pacify them what signify a few lives lost in a century or two the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants it is its natural manure
6639985 i cant let them go who would pay for the government

6639991 i had time to plan what a ceo would do in the job the first 180 days
