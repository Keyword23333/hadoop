8930000 take care of my buddies a lot of them are still over there and then will you please help take care of me
8930001 the world misses his music but i miss my brother
8930002 rubbish rumours of renewing wedding vows i think once was enough and ive just paid out on a big party for her birthday
8930003 i heard a few clubs were interested but sunderland didnt want to sell
8930004 it was the hardest decision of my career i had a chat with roy keane and he didnt want me to go and tried to convince me to stay
8930005 i also met roy hodgson and spoke to roy met fulham and the team and decided i liked it already
8930006 ive been out for six months and want to move on and play and be closer to my family in london
8930007 i believe in the positive power of sport and play for children
8930008 hes a player in an ideal world you would not want to lose but i just want to make it absolutely clear that at the end of the day it was my decision to sell him
8930009 we got an offer that i feel was his value we are all aware james has had a difficult time he almost signed for them once before two years ago while on loan and was dragged back
8930010 proving that we can directly measure amyloid beta in the human brain is an important step forward for both clinical and basic research and that may be true not just in alzheimers disease but also in other serious neurological disorders
8930011 we cant at this point rule out a very early spike in amyloid right after a brain injury
8930012 the results have potentially important clinical implications because the measurement of amyloid beta in the human brain may turn out to be a good indicator of how well brain cells are communicating with each other even in very sick patients
8930013 if the results are validated in further studies this may assist physicians in making important patient management decisions in patients with acute neurological disorders
8930014 the new data fit well with the previous results in mice because improved neurological status is likely to go along with increased communication between brain cells
8930015 we havent measured how brain injury affects amyloid beta inside cells nor have we determined whether brain injury affects the ability of amyloid beta to form small aggregates that may be especially harmful
8930016 very little chance of an agreement with china on core issues
8930017 on the fundamental issue there has been no concrete result
8930018 i dont know about robinho because it is not my job to enter into talks about players i said something to peter a month ago and they tried to bring robinho here but my job is on the pitch
8930019 if they can bring him here it will be down to board meetings and i have to think about tottenham not about whether players have come or have not come
8930020 i dont know anything because i have not spoken to peter for the last two days
8930021 he is a very good player but it is not only me that wants him all the coaches in the world do too
8930022 so maybe i should go cheat just to make your dreams come true story conversation because nothing good will come from it
8930023 i like this about you that blah blah blah make him relaxed then bring the issue however lately ive been feeling really uncomfortable around you b c blah blah blah if he still doesnt seem to understand continue to this point and if this doesnt stop im going to leave you
8930024 i was stoned out of my gourd just coming back from lunch when one of the mailroom guys tells theres an mtv camera crew here to see me
8930025 you know how i know youre gay after the rembrandts sing so no one told you life was gonna be this way you fucking clap
8930026 i notified all my kids and my lawyer notified dinas attorney lets see if she has the decency and respect to bring my kids to the wake and funeral this will show her true colors
8930027 thus not even a call but thats par for the course with dina she didnt even send a card or visit when he was sick
8930028 i noticed you kept fanning yourself so i figured you were reading something racy that was causing you to get overheated
8930029 i brought my five year old daugther to east coast beach near marine parade ntuc underpass on 28 jun 2008 around 3 15pm and saw this man swimming in the sea and thereafter he decided to take off his swimwear exposing himself
8930030 he later walked to the beach naked to put this swim gear on a bench before going back to swim again
8930031 the whole eposide lasted about 15 minutes before he walked back to the bench to wear his gear
8930032 i was surprised that there were some young ladies there but none kicked a fuss over his action
8930033 my staff at ibm included 35 professionals and support personnel not only was i responsible for managing those individuals but i also directed all recruitment and hiring activities set salaries designed bonus plans facilitated the annual performance review process and projected long term staffing requirements whats more my team increased annual sales by more than 35 percent within just one year
8930034 i have extensive experience designing lotus spreadsheets so im sure getting a handle on excel wont take any time at all
8930035 this is what i know and this is how well ive done it
8930036 before we end id like to share one more thing with you that i think is important to the position and my fit within your organization
8930037 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8930038 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8930039 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
8930040 the more surprising the lies the easier they are to expose
8930041 drepung the largest tibetan monastery and once home to as many as 10 000 monks is now a re education camp for monks involved in the march 14 uprising
8930042 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8930043 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8930044 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8930045 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8930046 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8930047 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8930048 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8930049 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8930050 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8930051 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8930052 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8930053 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8930054 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8930055 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8930056 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8930057 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8930058 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8930059 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8930060 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8930061 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8930062 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8930063 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8930064 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8930065 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8930066 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8930067 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8930068 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8930069 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8930070 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8930071 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8930072 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8930073 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8930074 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8930075 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8930076 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8930077 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
8930078 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8930079 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8930080 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8930081 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8930082 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8930083 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8930084 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8930085 who are open to doing something on the production side
8930086 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8930087 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8930088 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8930089 here is the platform that you will focus on politically in a three pronged approach this sayeth the lord
8930090 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives

8930094 tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8930095 this is sen mccains decision and his announcement and we all want to be respectful of his desire to have the chance to announce it himself

8930113 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8930114 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

8930118 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
8930119 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8930120 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8930121 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8930122 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8930123 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

8930168 lultimo annuncio del ministro brunetta che dichiara di voler mettere mano ai permessi per lassistenza ai familiari invalidi rappresenta un nuovo grave attacco ai diritti del lavoratori che respingiamo con sdegno
8930169 se vero che i 3 giorni al mese di permesso retribuito consentiti dalla la legge 104 92 sono una foglia di fico apposta da uno stato che non garantendo la dovuta assistenza scarica sulle spalle delle famiglie lonere di provvedere ad invalidi e disabili prosegue greggi inaccettabile la messa in discussione di questo diritto nellambito di quella che appare come una vera e propria persecuzione dei lavoratori pubblici
8930170 privare i lavoratori di questi permessi cos come le pesanti penalizzazioni gi comminate a chi si ammala significa voler perseguire l obiettivo di smantellare lo stato sociale
8930171 a quando le sanzioni per quelle lavoratrici privilegiate che godono dei premessi di maternit
8930172 ma il ministro deve valutare con attenzione gli annunci ad effetto e gi emerso dalla stampa pi accorta che il tanto sbandierato calo del 37 del presunto assenteismo nel pubblico impiego stato calcolato su dati che riguardano solo 27 amministrazioni su 9 800 peraltro non individuate con i criteri statistici scientifici la propaganda ideologica dunque ha le gambe corte e la risposta dei lavoratori non tarder a farsi sentire

8930177 ho recuperato ho dormito come un sasso latletica anche un lavoro per i festeggiamenti a casa ci sar tempo nel cuore ho sempre i 200
8930178 una sensazione di gioia immensa il pubblico stato uno stimolo incredibile mi ha spinto
8930179 so benissimo cosa successo me ne sono reso subito conto avevo lavorato duramente proprio per questo
8930180 ho recuperato ho dormito come un sasso e sono pronto a divertirmi ancora
8930181 perch questo anche un lavoro un bellissimo lavoro e la stagione non finita
8930182 non lo so non mi diverte lallenamento per i 400 per almeno quattro o cinque anni non penso di farli ho tanti altri traguardi ancora da raggiungere poi magari cambier idea ma per ora quella gara troppo lunga una maratona veloce lasciatemi godere lo sprint e il ballo che preferisco
8930183 i 200 fin da bambino sognavo un giorno di vincerla allolimpiade era un chiodo fisso adesso ne ho altri
8930184 il mio allenatore mi ha fatto accettare lidea di mangiare verdura ma per il resto mi piace tutto e poi brucio tutto sono molto normale a tavola non c nessun segreto
8930185 io ho sempre avuto il massimo rispetto per tutti ho solo sfogato la mia gioia e quando ho parlato con gli altri mi hanno detto che avevo fatto bene nessuno di loro si lamentato con me
8930186 non lo sapevo non mi ha mai parlato le scuse proprio non lo so
8930187 ho visto quei ragazzi colpiti duramente la cina mi ha dato tanto ed era normale e necessario che dessi indietro qualcosa chiunque lo avrebbe fatto la solidariet importante
8930188 e sempre bello sognare con le parole pu essere un obiettivo possibile in perfette condizioni ma per ora mi accontento di quello che ho fatto

8930214 la gente pensa che la vita sia una strada dritta ma sbaglia la vita un circolo un maledetto cerchio che gira in tondo alla fine ti ritrovi in mano esattamente quello che avevi allinizio e finisci per tornare al luogo da cui sei venuto
8930215 mi rimasto cos poco a cui aggrapparmi e non voglio che mi venga tolto
8930216 ti sbagli la realt ce li strappa a uno a uno
8930217 no non mi quadrava pi niente pi che altro si trattava di stupidaggini e poi
8930218 non ti importa se sono un mostro se non sono umano
8930219 lo so bella credimi lo so come se ti fossi portata via met di me stesso
8930220 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8930221 prima di te bella la mia vita era una notte senza luna molto buia ma con qualche stella punti di luce e razionalit poi hai attraversato il cielo come una meteora allimprovviso tutto ha preso fuoco cera luce cera bellezza quando sei sparita la meteora scomparsa dietro l orizzonte e il buio tornato non era cambiato nulla ma i miei occhi erano rimasti accecati non vedevo pi le stelle niente aveva pi senso
8930222 ogni santa notte ogni volta che chiudo gli occhi lei li ogni volta che la mia mente vuota lei la occupa oh wiliam quando tu non ci sei io mi sento cos inutile cos debole e lei mi logora dallinterno mi sento come se fossi divisa in miliardi di coriandoli tutti senza senso e tu non so come riesci a dargli quel senso riesci a farmi sentire che esisto quando invece io non so pi chi sono non lo so pi
8930223 ho visto te fra lei sue braccia ho sentito il male che ti ha fatto dalla prima volta che sei entrato in questa stanza penso che questa sia colpa tua
8930224 tu hai risvegliato la parte peggiore di me quella che mi faceva male ho rivisto frammenti del suo e del tuo passato ho visto come la guardavi ed anche se non volevo credere che fossi tu quel ragazzo inconsciamente io invidiavo natalie perch so che non potrai mai guardarmi come guardavi lei
8930225 ho sentito la sua perfidia lei mi perseguita mi dice che non sono niente e che tu gli apparterrai per leternit
8930226 ero gi un vampiro allepoca lei non lo sapeva o almeno io non glielo avevo confessato me ne innamorai perdutamente nellistante i cui la vidi
8930227 era bellissima fui superficiale a limitarmi allapparenza cominciai a frequentare il suo castello ogni giorno ogni notte sorgeva proprio qui questa era la sua stanza
8930228 decisi di dirle la verit ero stupidamente sicuro che lei mi amasse solo ora so quanto mi stessi sbagliando non so come ma venne a conoscenza della mia natura da sola allepoca circolavano strane dicerie sui vampiri si diceva che mangiando le nostre carni si poteva ottenere limmortalit senza linconveniente della dannazione
8930229 ma io non volevo vedere non volevo sentire volevo solo lei lultima sera che la vidi nella sua stanza fui attaccato da un esercito di vampiri allora non potevo pi sfuggire dalla realt
8930230 ero forte ma non cos forte per sfuggire ad un esercito lei era li di fronte a me mentre gli altri mi tenevano in modo che non potessi sfuggire non so come riusc a farsi ubbidire da quei vampiri non so nemmeno cosa promise loro in cambio mi disse il suo desiderio ed il suo intento mi aveva venduto ad una nobile famiglia del tempo in cambio di qualche trancio della mia carne lei voleva limmortalit la bellezza eterna lunica cosa importante per lei mi disse che avrebbe mangiato le miei carni che in questo modo avrebbe esaudito anche il mio desiderio essere parte di lei per sempre capii che era pazza che ero stato uno stupido a cercare qualcosa di cos profondo come lamore in una come lei ale era cos fredda cos vuota
8930231 mi fece rinchiudere nelle segrete del suo palazzo quello fu il suo unico errore piegai le sbarre di quella prigione avevo un solo desiderio ucciderla
8930232 rotornai nelle sue stanze alla mia vista i suoi occhi si riempirono di paura di terrore e ne fui felice perch in qualche modo ero riuscito a fargliprovare almeno unemozione alla fine non fui in grado di ucciderla
8930233 la baciai unultima volta cercando di trasmetterle tutto lodio che avevo tutto il ribrezzo me ne andai e non la rividi mai pi ora so cosa le accadde
8930234 lunica cosa che seppi dopo essermene andato che il suo esercito fin col distruggersi da solo soltanto uno si salv a quello scempio gli augur di subire tutte le pene dellinferno gli promise che lavrebbe perseguitata ovunque in ongi vita qualunque forma avesse assunto lui lavrebbe perseguitata sarebbe stato la sua paura pi grande
8930235 poi mi allontanai cos tanto da quel luogo da questo luogo che lei per me non divenne altro che un amaro ricordo un ricordo nitido del mio orgoglio ferito del mio cuore infranto un ricordo che mi perseguitava ed al quale non potevo sottrarmi la mia punizione per aver assaggiato il frutto proibito poi decisi di tornare ed te che ho incontrato tu risvegliasti tutto quel dolore che mi sembrava di tenere sepolto tu eri identica a lei to odiai per questo ti odiai con tutte le mie forze inizialmente pensavo addirittura che tu fossi lei che in qualche modo era riuscita a restare in vita io lo speravo
8930236 gi non sei nemmeno lontanamente paragonabile a lei per fortuna
8930237 e tu mi portasti qui qui dove tutto era cominciato decisi allora che qui anche tutto sarebbe finito ma tu non eri una normale ragazza di questa epoca
8930238 avvertisti subito la mia presenza e questo mi spavent ma ormai avevo deciso tu mi avresti liberato da tutte le mie pene poi a tutto questo si aggiunse il tuo profumo cos dolce cos intenso e la ciliegina sulla torta pensai sarebbe stato tutto pi semplice naturale io ero il vampiro tu la preda ma i tuoi occhi il tuo modo di fare il dubbio cominci a d insinuarsi nei miei pensieri tu non eri lei mi sentii un mostro eppure capii immediatamente di non essere pi capace di allontanarmi da te tu eri una perfida illusione per me lillusione che natalie fosse ancora li per me che fosse diversa
8930239 avanti avanti fa quello per cui sei venuto quella dannata sera mettiamo fine a questo stupido gioco
8930240 ti sto solo chiedendo di rendere concreto ci che in realt hai gi fatto
8930241 va bene se ci che vuoi far ci per cui venni quella sera
8930242 era per questo che ero venuto quella sera non ti avrei mai morsa
8930243 no resister perch ora tu sei pi importante del mio istinto tu sei pi importante di tutto
8930244 voglio che tu lo sappia non sei come lei tu sei tutto ci che ho sempre desiderato tu sei lamore della mia eternit
8930245 the vampire and me 2 quando passato e presente si mescolano
8930246 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno

8930325 when i first spoke out i clearly stated that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina after a recent phone call from lindsay while she was traveling on one of samanthas dj gigs i became very concerned
8930326 everything was arranged and agreed i have dozens of texts and recordings with dina to prove it but when the time came on sunday dina chose to go into nyc and have dinner with sam sams mother and lindsay rather than address real issues and make things better for lindsay
8930327 a day later dina told me that sam was writing a book that sam was a negative influence on lindsay and that sam needs to be out of lindsays life then she asked me how to do it
8930328 matters became worse when dina said lindsay was in real danger and she needed to save her and get lindsay into a place these are all dinas words tell me what father wouldnt be concerned and even pissed at sam after hearing this
8930329 to even imagine that dina would then go on vacation is even more sickening
8930330 dina cares please lindsay was once stalked by a guy name deleted who dina trusted and i said from the get go that i didnt only for dina to look the other way when i had to get a task force to track him down
8930331 dina took a percentage of lindsays money when i never took a red cent all the while i only speak out when something is wrong or needs to be made right
8930332 dina is a money loving fame seeking self serving deceiver who comes from roots of the same
8930333 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8930334 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break
8930335 going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control

8930394 he was this great little english actor ah youre too young to remember him but he was great
8930395 ive got no time for these arseholes if you pardon the swearing who strive to be well known and then dont want to talk to anyone they wont sign autographs i actually stopped counting the signed photographs after wed sent out 22 000 of them well stop counting now reet i said to my wife
8930396 im tight as a crabs arse like him im always going around the house turning lights off
8930397 she deserves it she works hard at her study and she works part time i get a great kick out of being able to do things like that
8930398 it was wonderful i wouldnt have got looked after half as well in private as i was by the nurses and doctors in broadgreen so we raised about 19 000 as a little thank you
8930399 i love life now i wake up at half six in the morning and im going to be crude now i do my toilet job im wide awake and it doesnt matter if its raining i love the day
8930400 i remember the bailiffs turning up to repossess my house i know what it is to have been in the gutter and have nothing to live in one room over a boxing club and then to come back and make a million pounds well
8930401 i was in a conservative party club the other day and i thought whod have thought id be here i still hate shes a bastard they were arguing over whether she should have a state funeral and i said that she should as long as its tomorrow
8930402 i say to them are you joking i love it that show made me a bloody fortune i was with when he was making a film over here a few years back and all these girls started screaming me arse at me and samuel thought it was crazy

8930406 i like to send notes to other performers when i see something i love i never got to tell him how brilliant i thought he was in that
8930407 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8930408 i was blown away by the buzz i felt competing in the gladiators arena again
8930409 the audience was explosive and phenomenal and clearly wanted more of the wolf man

8930421 eu digo isso todos os dias tony o amor da minha vida
8930422 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
8930423 the shibu soren government is the outcome of the india us nuclear deal the impact is visible as madhu koda was removed and shibu soren made the chief minister
8930424 soren struggled for creating the state but he has become the laughing stock in order to form the government
8930425 when i can create a separate jharkhand state then why cannot i develop the state
8930426 i will not say much rather i will act for the development of the state

8930433 luxury isnt getting a ton better but it is hanging in there people are going to remain concerned about what happens next given the state of the global economy and the global equity markets
8930434 the good news is that the sector is still outperforming others over the next two years
8930435 its just a matter of getting through the storm by focusing on the right markets the right suppliers and the right categories weve got to run a tighter smarter business
8930436 the biggest mistake luxury brands make is in not sticking with their core value system and core customer
8930437 i dont think you could say that by staying true a brand is guaranteed success however if they dont stay true success will be much more difficult to come by
8930438 hermes sells the absolutely classic birkin bags but also bring out new styles of merchandise from watches to branded cars that show they know how to continue to interpret and apply their core values
8930439 we were also extremely solid in developing countries like china asia as a whole south america and the middle east
8930440 we have to find interesting opportunities with a profitability that would be interesting for our investors which is not easy
8930441 we will adapt to opportunities but it will have to be a high quality high luxury brand
8930442 guys you know the place has defaulted every 10 years since the 1930s so what makes you think it will be different this time around make them prove it

8930451 joe bowles also indicates cutting many budget items including the arts
8930452 these are the same groups that bowles and mayor deke copenhaver often attend with their wives such as the augusta symphony and the opera
8930453 this may be something to re evaluate for those who may not be able to afford the 5 000 to 9 000 per year cost of richmond county private schools
8930454 my point is this speak only if you want to be heard and make sure to have relevance and factual research completed to support your opinion free speech for city employees doesnt mean spouting out how you can spend your money and wish others had more this also means putting the money you clearly are bragging about saving the city on gas into the organizations that need it and that you attend regularly such as the symphony or the opera

8930458 our members are against it because our customers are paying premium prices for drink
8930459 they feel that they deserve to get it in a glass which is a much better product to serve drinks in
8930460 its a low risk but its the individual who actually commits the offence who should be paying for it not the pubs or the majority of customers

8930463 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court

8930466 we came to see the initial appearance of the biggest butcher of the 20th century in the balkans

8930470 hopefully we can see something that will allow us to concentrate on one particular area
8930471 enset is the last food asset for most families in this region
8930472 seeing it in the market in such quantities means there is no other food to eat
8930473 i expect to harvest food that can last me at least six months
8930474 once the food gets finished i will sell firewood or work for someone to feed the children
8930475 when you get people living on the edge a shock like drought easily pushes them over
8930476 then it brings them into the cycle of not being able to pull themselves out of it
8930477 over the past two months the situation has worsened and living conditions have deteriorated people have exhausted all their resources and are unable to feed themselves
8930478 we have pockets of severe malnutrition in some districts in the south and an emergency situation in the somali region
8930479 its not small to those who are suffering but it is a manageable problem
8930480 famine has wreaked havoc in ethiopia for so long it would be stupid not to be sensitive to the risk of such things occurring but there has not been a famine on our watch emergencies but no famines
8930481 we are seeing phase one we are yet to see phase two
8930482 it is normal to have small areas of malnutrition during the hunger season when people wait for the harvest
8930483 this year it is more widespread mainly because of failed rains
8930484 comparison between the sources of food in a normal year and the past four weeks indicated a dramatic shift from own production to purchased food and other sources
8930485 the government delayed then under described the problem still it does not compare with 1984
8930486 the main problems are inadequate rains and too many people
8930487 the population has doubled in the last 22 years from 41 to almost 80 million peoples coping mechanisms have been eroded and many have got used to handouts over the years
8930488 as long as the people do not own the land they will not invest in it
8930489 the big question is whether we have enough in our own economy to be able to finance it
8930490 with only five infections since march 2008 all of whom died
8930491 the office of the un resident representative for vietnam with the world health organization who the food and agriculture organization fao and the un childrens fund unicef taking the lead has worked closely with the ministry of agriculture and rural development and other relevant ministries
8930492 in may 2007 we provided support for a mass radio and tv awareness campaign and also helped to train provincial and district level health staff on safeguards against ai and human avian influenza and in honing their communication skills
8930493 people are aware of the need to wash their hands but many dont i believe that things will change but it will take time
8930494 i think the campaign should now involve community health workers at the commune level not just the provincial and district levels
8930495 since 2007 with the help of unicef weve been training the womens union staff down to the commune level on avian influenza organising and raising awareness we do it through poems singing and plays
8930496 women are the ones who are directly involved in raising poultry so the womens union is the most effective means in reaching women with the key messages
8930497 i just dont think i will have an avian flu outbreak here tien told irin

8930510 es ist schwer im existenzkampf auf junge spieler zu setzen
8930511 eine frechheit findet zumal wir mit tremmel einen deutschen klassemann im tor haben
8930512 prasnikar eilte der ruf voraus dass er auf junge spieler setzt wirklich umgesetzt hat er das meiner meinung nach noch nicht
8930513 es sind nur wenige die schon so fr h das zeug haben sich mit weltklassespielern zu messen

8930528 the acquisition of gateway reflects vodacoms strategy to reposition itself as a leading pan african provider of communications services and to diversify from its current status as primarily a mobile centric network operator
8930529 we believe that gateways significant presence across africa will allow vodacom to tap into the huge potential for growth in business services and connectivity and will enhance our position with multinational corporations
8930530 this is an exciting milestone in gateways development as a unique pan african service provider
8930531 we will increase resources efficiency and product range and continue our relentless focus on meeting the requirements of all africas mobile networks and multinational corporations

8930534 we got kicked out of there the olympic athlete has nowhere to train
8930535 we have been happy to allow alan to use the facilities at the training centre during the run up to the olympics
8930536 unfortunately operational requirements now mean that we need to use this facility for the use of site personnel
8930537 this facility will reflect the best in class found throughout the industry
8930538 obviously the safety of our personnel on site and the need to provide the best facilities for them is one of our highest priorities
8930539 if i go for 2012 i will put everything into it and move away because if the facilities are not here to train i cant stand in my mums garage
8930540 it was kind of strange coming home after so long i am trying to get back into normal life

8930600 i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet twenty first century challenges with a twentieth century bureaucracy

8930615 we didnt turn up tonight and full credit to melbourne they came at us and they punished us
8930616 we lost a lot of players last season so were going to hurt from that but weve got to pick ourselves up and weve got to be competitive this year
8930617 it was a fantastic performance and if we had have had a penalty it could have been more
8930618 the amount of interpassing the chances at goal it was a very good game of football for us

8930622 recently fitzgerald attended a training session in alabama where he learned how best to deal with devices used by protesters that are designed to hinder their removal or arrest
8930623 last july a pair of protesters on putney road locked themselves into a device called a dragon a 55 gallon drum filled with rebar and concrete police resorted to the use of tasers to get the protesters to release themselves from the barrel
8930624 now the town is facing a lawsuit over the use of tasers to force compliance
8930625 but i never would have thought to grab a jackhammer
8930626 while the safety of the protesters needs to be taken into consideration forcing compliance might not be the best way to end a protest
8930627 worry about the device its a whole different mindset to defeat a problem
8930628 the department plans to send more officers to the training in the future he said the training is paid for by the federal government
8930629 i will not plead in line with my standpoint on this court
8930630 i have stopped using a false name i think all parties should do the same
8930631 its a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
8930632 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers
8930633 todays price rises are due to massive increases in wholesale costs which make current pricing levels unsustainable following a price decrease in 2007 and an increase at the start of 2008
8930634 until today npowers domestic gas prices were still the same level they were 18 months ago whereas during this time the cost of wholesale gas has doubled
8930635 soaring raw material prices which have risen by 122 for gas and coal and 79 for oil over the last 12 months
8930636 especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much at the moment
8930637 real support to consumers struggling to pay energy bills that have gone up by almost 40 this year alone
8930638 there is strong expectation that the government will shortly announce a raft of measures to protect the most vulnerable
8930639 han asegurado que no hay absolutamente ning n motivo para la preocupaci n
8930640 su santidad se unir al ayuno y a las plegarias por la paz y la libertad
8930641 tests revealed they corded phones use just a trace amount of electricity through the phone line as opposed to the cordless variety which consumes two to three watts just sitting in the dock
8930642 simpson needs to explain in exhausting detail what every single song is about and the endless banter kills any momentum shes still living in a reality show convinced everyone is so fascinated with her personal life theyd rather hear her talk than sing
8930643 i do pass gas a lot i guarantee it smells like roses
8930644 the difference between stupidity and genius is that genius has its limits
8930645 this is a fantastic deal for the council and im delighted the club will not only be moving to the city but also changing their name to the glasgow rocks
8930646 bringing a professional club like the rocks here will help put glasgow on the national and international stage as a city which is committed to sporting excellence particularly as they will eventually be based at the national indoor sports arena
8930647 the players from the club already deliver a range of significant activities for young people many of whom are vulnerable through the scottish sports futures programme
8930648 the council and its partners will now work with the club to do even more to enrich peoples lives in glasgow
8930649 all of us at the rocks are thrilled with this new partnership
8930650 glasgow has been such a strong supporter of our community efforts for several years now and this agreement is another step in the right direction for the rocks the local community and the sport of basketball
8930651 the new nisa facility will be one of the finest in the uk and we can already see the cooperation and commitment of from the city that will help us build the sport and the fan base that will fill that 5000 arena
8930652 meanwhile were also looking forward to our time at kelvin hall well be right in the heart of glasgows west end and the set up will provide and electric atmosphere
8930653 the players think the added noise level should help the team win a few extra games and hopefully bring home some silverware
8930654 this really is an exciting time for the rocks and we have this new glasgow partnership to thank for making it all possible
8930655 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers
8930656 although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
8930657 we have tried hard to keep electricity prices as low as possible and our increase of 9 is the lowest in the sector
8930658 the continuing volatility in the global market for gas is directly contributing to increasing uks domestic energy prices and scottish power is not immune to these rises
8930659 the order prevents me from screaming and shouting at such a level that im a nuisance
8930660 we have been told to close the windows and doors when we do it but it is hot at the moment so we have to leave the windows open
8930661 apparently im so loud people think im getting murdered the police said theyd called round because they feared for my safety
8930662 neighbours have complained to both sunderland city council and northumbria police of nuisance behaviour from the occupiers of the property
8930663 we have investigated the complaints and have attempted to solve the problem both formally and informally
8930664 due to ongoing concerns the council is now considering the most appropriate form of action to prevent further disturbance to local residents
8930665 we are delighted with the support we have had from futurebuilders england
8930666 it understood our needs and worked closely with us to develop our application initial work is now underway and we can look forward to developing a truly inspiring place for disabled people to live
8930667 investments like these are what futurebuilders is all about the investment will help the percy headley foundation create modern facilities for its service users and help the foundation win further public service contracts and we hope to invest in similar organisations in the near future
8930668 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
8930669 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
8930670 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
8930671 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
8930672 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
8930673 is poised to enhance its competitive position in the marketplace
8930674 we wanted to incorporate non corrosive waterproof zipper technology into the new design so the pockets that were once completely open behind the large bellows pockets in front are now about an inch and a half to the side of the large front pockets and completely waterproof when closed were using riri zippers which are far superior to the reverse coil coated zippers that you see on a lot of waterproof gear these days weve also moved to double rip stop nylon 6 fabric in part because of its abrasion resistance and because it doesnt wet out as fast as the stretch fabric but also because nylon 6 is completely recyclable and of course one of our goals is to have recyclable fabric in everything we make by 2010
8930675 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8930676 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
8930677 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
8930678 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
8930679 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
8930680 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
8930681 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8930682 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8930683 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
8930684 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
8930685 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
8930686 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
8930687 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
8930688 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
8930689 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
8930690 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
8930691 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
8930692 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
8930693 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
8930694 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
8930695 his agents and the english fa are trying to help him secure a special fifa clearance

8930701 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
8930702 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
8930703 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
8930704 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
8930705 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
8930706 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
8930707 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
8930708 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8930709 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
8930710 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
8930711 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
8930712 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
8930713 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
8930714 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
8930715 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
8930716 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
8930717 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
8930718 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
8930719 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
8930720 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
8930721 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
8930722 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
8930723 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
8930724 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
8930725 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
8930726 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
8930727 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
8930728 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
8930729 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8930730 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8930731 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
8930732 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
8930733 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
8930734 guns n roses representatives have been made aware of the arrest and are leaving the matter to the authorities
8930735 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
8930736 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
8930737 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
8930738 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
8930739 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
8930740 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u

8930748 he was ahead of his time and he did everything himself
8930749 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
8930750 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
8930751 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis

8930976 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8930977 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8930978 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8930979 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8930980 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8930981 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8930982 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8930983 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8930984 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8930985 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
8930986 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
8930987 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8930988 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons

8931011 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8931012 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8931013 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8931014 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8931015 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8931016 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8931017 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8931018 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8931019 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8931020 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8931021 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8931022 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8931023 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8931024 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8931025 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8931026 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8931027 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8931028 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8931029 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8931030 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8931031 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8931032 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8931033 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8931034 this was the first match of the year for both teams
8931035 it was good to get that first win under our belts especially in the morning before the rains came
8931036 that match for second doubles was real close and it could have gone either way
8931037 this whole match was played between two evenly matched teams
8931038 conditions were tough for both teams today with the sprinkling rain and winds
8931039 we have a solid core of seniors returning with a great deal of experience

8931041 this should be the best golf season mynderse has seen in a while i was thrilled with last seasons outcome and we are returning five starters from that team who can compete with the best and three players who are ready to support my seasoned starters
8931042 we lost a lot of talent and experience to graduation
8931043 however we return four players that have a lot of experience filling in the last two spots will be the key to any successes that we have
8931044 this year we will be playing both it will be interesting to see how we fare against them honestly we are looking to improve on last years record 5 9 overall
8931045 this year we will have a team that will be competitive in the league

8931050 i really dont know about what will happen in our division this year
8931051 maybe it will change the league maybe it wont but i know that if my top five or four can play up to their potential we can and will be tough

8931206 when i first spoke out i clearly stated that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina after a recent phone call from lindsay while she was traveling on one of samanthas dj gigs i became very concerned
8931207 everything was arranged and agreed i have dozens of texts and recordings with dina to prove it but when the time came on sunday dina chose to go into nyc and have dinner with sam sams mother and lindsay rather than address real issues and make things better for lindsay
8931208 a day later dina told me that sam was writing a book that sam was a negative influence on lindsay and that sam needs to be out of lindsays life then she asked me how to do it
8931209 matters became worse when dina said lindsay was in real danger and she needed to save her and get lindsay into a place these are all dinas words tell me what father wouldnt be concerned and even pissed at sam after hearing this
8931210 to even imagine that dina would then go on vacation is even more sickening
8931211 dina cares please lindsay was once stalked by a guy name deleted who dina trusted and i said from the get go that i didnt only for dina to look the other way when i had to get a task force to track him down
8931212 dina took a percentage of lindsays money when i never took a red cent all the while i only speak out when something is wrong or needs to be made right
8931213 dina is a money loving fame seeking self serving deceiver who comes from roots of the same
8931214 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes
8931215 whos out of control whose life is out of control give me a break
8931216 going from place to place being dragged around by samantha so she can make more money off of lindsay being there when she spins shes gone from making 7 million to less than a million a movie whos out of control

8931269 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8931270 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less more of you have lost your homes and more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition that is beyond your reach
8931271 failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed presidency of george w bush
8931272 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8931273 has worn the uniform of our country with bravery and distinction and for that we owe him our gratitude and respect
8931274 but the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 of the time sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 of the time
8931275 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 chance on change
8931276 a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8931277 mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8931278 have led our nation into one calamity after another because of their indifference to fact
8931279 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8931280 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8931281 we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8931282 borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8931283 represents a clean break from the politics of partisanship and bitter division
8931284 barack obama had the experience and wisdom to oppose a popular war based on faulty premises
8931285 his leadership experience has given him a unique capacity to inspire hope in the promise of the american dream of a boundless future
8931286 were never going to disrespect another hurricane again in our life
8931287 we feel we are more ready this year than we have ever been
8931288 in general were finding that state local and federal agencies are tremendously more capable than they were three years ago after katrina
8931289 five years ago we wouldnt even know there was a hurricane out there
8931290 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8931291 shes the one who put off buying a new car or a new dress for herself so that i could have a better life
8931292 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage
8931293 so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
8931294 stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8931295 the potential population of clients is too large so theres always a steady stream of new clients
8931296 there is great pride in this neighborhood and some of the older ladies just really let these guys have it
8931297 we are making a major down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8931298 will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
8931299 words and his example inspired an entire generation of the young and old the rich and poor people of all faiths races cultures and backgrounds to believe that we had the power we had the ability and we had the capacity to make that dream a reality
8931300 tonight we witness in part what has become of his dream
8931301 would be quick to remind us that realizing his dream is not barack obamas job alone america needs more than a great president to realize my fathers dream
8931302 weve come a long way but we must march again
8931303 on nov 4th we must march in every state in every city in every village we must march to the ballot box we must march like we have never marched before
8931304 democracy is not a state it is an act it is a series of actions we must take to build what martin luther king jr called the beloved community
8931305 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8931306 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
8931307 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators
8931308 when we reached the house where they were holding the girl they opened fire on our agents
8931309 he had no blueprint to look at he had no textbook to consult
8931310 he dealt with it and if youve noticed there hasnt been a terror attack in the united states of america since sept 11
8931311 when republicans are in charge and were spending like drunken sailors its an embarrassment
8931312 i feel like hes had extreme ups and extreme downs but in texas were still proud of him
8931313 his job was to keep us safe and he has done that he will go down in history for that
8931314 its worth every penny its worth every drop of blood we had to shed
8931315 is deterring those terrorists from being able to come and attack us theyre too busy hiding
8931316 if those things actually happen then its going to look like a brilliant foreign policy
8931317 instead of patrolling the streets of baghdad maybe we should have been patrolling the streets of detroit
8931318 thats going to be the nail in his coffin just like johnson with vietnam
8931319 bush went in with the idea to work in a bipartisan manner with both parties and for some reason nobody will let that happen
8931320 id like to have seen more of that rather than the intransigence
8931321 he comes to a conclusion and he sticks with that conclusion
8931322 if a person who does that turns out to be right they are labeled as dogged or determined
8931323 if a person who does that is wrong they are labeled as stubborn foolish or bullheaded
8931324 to shift the focus from me to the american people
8931325 to let them know that weve got a fundamental choice weve got to make and the decision we make in this election is going to set the course for this country
8931326 to nominate barack obama at the democratic national convention who may not even have been seated here 45 years ago this is big and i am very moved by it
8931327 its not only a bad economy but an unpopular party and an unpopular war but you go to the battleground states and there are a whole lot of people who are uncomfortable voting for an african american
8931328 white people who have a prejudice against black people but wont admit it
8931329 but that impression has been planted and its going to take a real hard pushback to neutralize it
8931330 hes just got to work day and night from now until election day take advantage of his youth and health
8931331 look at the judgments ive made and the judgments john mccain has made
8931332 are you better off now than you were eight years ago
8931333 hes up against a candidate who has got a very appealing personal history
8931334 the challenge will be to focus on the issues and what an obama administration will bring to average american families
8931335 the angst quite honestly some of its about race and we shouldnt lose sight of that
8931336 this election will be decided on the fundamentals not how many houses somebody has or whos elitist
8931337 im going to take them by the hand from the dormitory to the central polling place

8931347 john mccain has voted with george bush ninety percent of the time
8931348 we measure progress by how many people can find a job that pays the mortgage
8931349 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8931350 america we cannot turn back not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
8931351 we are hoping to tie up obinna from inter milan on loan for a season

8931361 the majority of opposition members of parliament voted for the boycott on august 3 the rest had no option but to bow to the majority
8931362 i did talk to international organisations before taking this important decision but i took it independently
8931363 from now public television will provide just three hours of airtime for the candidates
8931364 they have also introduced tougher requirements for filing lawsuits about the electoral process and getting complaints reviewed in courts
8931365 the authorities always falsify elections and do not create the conditions for fair competition
8931366 this time they have created a legislative basis for their games and inserted reactionary amendments into the electoral code
8931367 participating in this election would therefore merely serve to justify the victory for the authorities candidate for that reason we have decided to boycott the election
8931368 none of these prospective candidates is a serious rival for the current president
8931369 eldar namazov is the only person with the capacity to effect regime change and the entire opposition should be supporting him to realise that potential but it hasnt happened
8931370 these parties led by precisely the same leaders have lost eight elections in a row so their decision to boycott this one is just an admission of weakness
8931371 if the public thinks ilham aliyev has no serious rivals in the presidential election that is not our fault
8931372 it is ridiculous to think that if one party refuses to run for the presidency then its undemocratic for another one to take part
8931373 its like saying that if pupils who get poor marks or break the rules dont go to school then classes must be cancelled
8931374 i am forced to respect the decision of the majority time will show whether that decision was right or wrong
8931375 i think that refusing to run for the presidency means closing a window that opens only once in five years the musavat party should have shown it can participate in elections even under the worst of conditions
8931376 my statement about possibly running for the presidency was just an expression of protest at the decision taken by musavats council
8931377 i believe the musavat party must stand for the presidency and fight to the end but i had no serious intention to nominate my candidature for the presidency
8931378 i have left the party because i do not share its decision to boycott the election
8931379 i intend to nominate myself as a candidate for the presidency

8931411 the animating principle of my faith as taught to me by church and home was that the cardinal sin was abuse of power

8931423 armstrong says that positive thinking and doing a lot of sports can save you i dont agree

8931425 theres this idea that you can succeed and conquer anything even illness on the basis of your character
8931426 the main message from my point of view is that young women who have severe life events at a young age should be considered a risk group for breast cancer and treated accordingly
8931427 but general feelings of happiness and optimism in ones life can play a protective role
8931428 the problem with cancer is that its so complex by the time youre diagnosed it may have been building for decades
8931429 if a person is positive he or she is more likely to show up for all the treatments to have a better diet to exercise and if youre deeply depressed you sleep badly and thats bad for your health

8931483 better than it was before katrina but this is a work in progress
8931484 ladies and gentlemen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
8931485 the only thing that makes people feel best is to take action that gets them out of harms way
8931486 patients have been calling to find dialysis clinics in the areas they are going to evacuate to these calls have come primarily from louisiana since the governor has talked about evacuating
8931487 i believe we can change this land into something great
8931488 fight in zero gravity surrounded by the broken remains of billions of tons of rocky debris thrown into orbit by a huge explosion on the moon with simple and intuitive controls players will have complete freedom of movement making full use of the distinctive environment to control the battle
8931489 i guess if they can move into a new yankee stadium they can have instant replay the game is evolving much to my chagrin
8931490 i dont like it the game is the game let the game be pure in what it is
8931491 otherwise they are going to set themselves up for some embarrassing situations that could possibly occur and i dont think major league baseball at this particular time needs that
8931492 come on i shouldnt say its not going to work but this could turn into a little bit of a fiasco at first
8931493 its armageddon baseball is a game of human error it always has been and always will be why would you want to take that away i think its dumb
8931494 they should remove two rows of seats in the rightfield stands and raise the wall to the same height as it is in leftfield 12 feet that would eliminate line drive home runs that barely clear the 8 foot wall
8931495 they should put wind screens up in the gap in the stands between home plate and third base that causes a jet stream to right and right center
8931496 its the only sign weve missed all year and you only have to look for one thing
8931497 its going out there every game every win is crucial
8931498 all of a sudden you come into this scenario from where i was coming from
8931499 i dont know im not a bat maker and im not a termite so i cant tell you whats good wood and whats bad wood
8931500 im happy to see manny i respect him in my career barry bonds and ramirez have been the two best of my time
8931501 its just that they dont know what theyre doing out there what pitch to throw what to do in a given situation also pitchers are told to try to pitch to the hitters weakness instead of staying with their own strength do you think nolan ryan pitched to a hitters weakness or stayed with his strength
8931502 we have received instructions at the foreign ministry and we will cut diplomatic relations with the russian federation
8931503 georgias interests in russia will be represented by the embassy of a third party
8931504 since 1991 the energy lever has been used for putting political or economic pressure on estonia latvia lithuania ukraine belarus moldova georgia that subsequently affected most of europe the number of incidents i e cut offs take overs coercive price policy blackmail or threats is over fifty in total of which about forty are cut offs incidents appear to be equally divided on the yeltsin and putin eras but the number of cut offs have decreased by half during putin the immediate reasons for russias coercive policy appear to be to coerce political concession in ongoing negotiations commandeer infrastructure take over and execute economically favorable deals or to make political statements
8931505 it could have been georgia or something else but some kind of last straw was waiting to come along
8931506 moscows only condition was that nato did not station troops in east germany
8931507 we cannot base our actions on the opinion of a state whose budget falls within the statistical error of the u s budget
8931508 there is a feeling that the west treats russia merely as a loser in the cold war which has to play by the winners rules
8931509 the good performance of our army in ossetia has already impressed our partners
8931510 we should do everything to uphold this impression and end once and forever any temptation by our partners to resolve any problems by force
8931511 federal court statistics for 2007 suggest civil courts functioning as expected
8931512 over 80 000 women served in our armed forces during that war
8931513 although they may not have realised it at the time these early women volunteers did much to break down the barriers for all those service women who have come after them and who continue to serve their country today so proficiently and professionally
8931514 the patients in our study were very clear they told us they care about these relationships and want to be fully informed about them but at the same time the information didnt substantially affect their decision to enter a trial
8931515 ok that sounds more appropriate so theres no payment to him but through the university ok im good
8931516 we clearly live in a time of heightened sensitivity about these matters
8931517 policy makers may want to consider more restrictive policies for equity relationships than for other financial interests in research
8931518 our work showed that all nine antipsychotic drugs we examined uniformly and more potently block the beta arrestin pathway downstream of the d2 dopamine receptor
8931519 some activated it some blocked the g side totally some blocked it only 50 percent the drugs had different profiles for the g protein pathway
8931520 so with this new information drug manufacturers would want to make sure new compounds for antipsychotic use block the beta arrestin pathway
8931521 this work with antipsychotic drugs represents an entirely new approach for studying drug effects and developing new ones
8931522 using cells to monitor specific receptor signaling pathways could provide more selective medicines with fewer side effects
8931523 using these assays as a means to develop antipsychotics should be a useful way to target precise responses and improve patient symptoms
8931524 not all drugs used for schizophrenia have the same degree of movement related side effects
8931525 for some of the drugs these side effects may stem from interactions on the g protein part of the pathways
8931526 an abrupt switch from late nights to early mornings can set the stage for irregular sleep patterns that can sap the alertness and energy vital to school performance
8931527 its important to foster good sleep habits within the days leading up to the first day of school
8931528 from family bike rides to a friendly game of tag or a walk to the park after dinner the important thing is to make fitness fun
8931529 children are not always forthcoming with and many times not able to identify whats causing them to be unhappy or unproductive
8931530 communication is key to helping your child recognize stress and anxiety and work towards a solution
8931531 these assessments are integral in the detection of health conditions that could cause serious illness
8931532 since recommendations can change throughout the year be sure to stay up on recommendations and check in with your pediatrician if its been awhile since your childs last physical

8931541 allomap can help contribute to an appropriate treatment plan by identifying those patients not experiencing post operative heart transplant rejection
8931542 it is an example of how advancements in science and technology are leading to new medical care diagnostics
8931543 this is a promising new lead in the search for biological pathways that contribute to obesity
8931544 this finding may eventually lead to the development of new drugs to regulate appetite in people who have not had success with other treatments
8931545 sadly we frequently see patients admitted to a hospital with a devastating stroke who are known to have atrial fibrillation yet were either not taking warfarin or were taking a dose that is not therapeutic we consider these to be potentially preventable strokes
8931546 on one hand we have an extremely effective and cheap medication for stroke prevention warfarin yet on the other hand it remains under used in people who would benefit most from it
8931547 unfortunately the fear of bleeding side effects with warfarin results in many patients not taking effective therapy that could prevent disabling and fatal strokes
8931548 we must always weigh the pros and cons of any medication for individual patients but for most high risk atrial fibrillation patients the benefits of taking warfarin for stroke prevention greatly outweigh the potential side effects including serious bleeding complications
8931549 this is a public health priority because atrial fibrillation is one of the most common causes of stroke
8931550 many more strokes could be prevented if anti coagulation therapy were optimized in the population at large
8931551 too often and for too long we have overstated the inconvenience of warfarin and exaggerated its risks ignoring convincing evidence of its effectiveness in practice gladstone et al reminds us of the perils of discounting the benefits of warfarin
8931552 revealing a mechanism by which treadmill therapy improves a stroke survivors gait was the novel goal of the study
8931553 this study provides the first evidence of increased activation in cortical and subcortical circuitry produced by treadmill exercise training in stroke survivors
8931554 we saw what we call an equivalent of neuroplasticity a change in brain activation that reflects the brains adaptability
8931555 it is promising that treadmill exercise can stimulate new or underused brain circuits and improve walking in stroke survivors even after completion of conventional rehabilitation therapy
8931556 it becomes more clear that the aerobic treadmill therapy has to be included in the therapy programs that are offered to chronic stroke survivors
8931557 the toxic combination of bad policies economics and politics is in large measure responsible for the fact that a majority of people in the world do not enjoy the good health that is biologically possible
8931558 health inequity really is a matter of life and death
8931559 but health systems will not naturally gravitate towards equity unprecedented leadership is needed that compels all actors including those beyond the health sector to examine their impact on health primary health care which integrates health in all of governments policies is the best framework for doing so
8931560 central to the commissions recommendations is creating the conditions for people to be empowered to have freedom to lead flourishing lives nowhere is lack of empowerment more obvious than in the plight of women in many parts of the world health suffers as a result following our recommendations would dramatically improve the health and life chances of billions of people
8931561 water borne diseases are not caused by a lack of antibiotics but by dirty water and by the political social and economic forces that fail to make clean water available to all heart disease is caused not by a lack of coronary care units but by lives people lead which are shaped by the environments in which they live obesity is not caused by moral failure on the part of individuals but by the excess availability of high fat and high sugar foods
8931562 we rely too much on medical interventions as a way of increasing life expectancy
8931563 a more effective way of increasing life expectancy and improving health would be for every government policy and programme to be assessed for its impact on health and health equity to make health and health equity a marker for government performance
8931564 four months out is the perfect time to think about what you can afford

8931576 the decline is attributed to the lower than projected tax and non tax revenue total expenditure and net lending increased to d2 0 billion or 13 6 percent compared to the first half of 2007 the overall budget balance including grants on commitment basis was a deficit of d113 0 million or 1 3 percent of gdp excluding grants the deficit widened to d164 4 million or 1 8 percent of gdp

8931581 garbage typically hasnt been called an economic indicator but we firmly believe it is
8931582 solid waste production goes up and down with the economy
8931583 we see our own garbage and we think thats what fills up landfills
8931584 but a big chunk of landfills is construction debris its not so much that were buying fewer 2 liter soda bottles its less construction going on
8931585 dont represent that big of a piece to account for the kinds of fluctuations were seeing in the amounts going into the landfills
8931586 we have seen in the past that with downturns in the economy disposal tonnage reduces
8931587 has taken a substantial dip in the past two or three years
8931588 for the first six months of 2008 weve seen a 3 decline year over year
8931589 last year we took in 871 000 tons this year were on track to take in closer to 820 000 tons
8931590 we have seen a slowdown in what has been set out at the curb
8931591 when you see that from our perspective people arent buying as much or buying the large ticket items
8931592 most pronounced is a decline in construction and demolition waste as real estate construction slows along with the economy
8931593 we rely on people to throw things away to make money cash flow has been a problem for the past two years because of declining quantities

8931625 the best british political libertarian blog on the web consistently excellent but not for the squeamish
8931626 but for all that he is a brilliant writer incisive fisker extraordinaire and with an over developed sense of humour and he can back up his sometimes extraordinary views with some good old fashioned intellectual rigour im promoting him on my blogroll to a daily read
8931627 the glorious devils kitchen not for the squeamish or easily offended
8931628 a very smart article takes a pretty firm libertarian line on the matter
8931629 by the way dk seems to be on fucking good form at the moment
8931630 devils kitchen is the big name on the free market libertarian strand of the british blogosphere profane rants are the immediate stand out feature of dks blog but the ranting is backed up by some formidable argument on a wide range of issues particularly relating to british and european parliamentary politics economics and civil liberties
8931631 an excellent intelligent uk political blog which includes a great deal of swearing
8931632 i like the devils kitchen i think its one of the best written and funniest blogs in the business
8931633 for sheer intelligence erudition and fun iain dales diary cranmer and devils kitchen are so far ahead of the rest i dont see how they can figure in a top ten they are the beatles stones and who of the blog world the astair bogart and marlon brando of the blog world the gerswin porter and novello of the blog world the dot cotton pat butcher bette lynch of the blog world
8931634 its the blogging equivalent of someone eating ostrich vindaloo washed down by ten bottles of jamaican hot pepper sauce and then proceeding to breathe very close to your face while talking about how lovely our politicians are but theres much more to his writing than four letter words
8931635 the devils kitchen is a life affirming life enhancing blog this particular post will also lead you to some of the best soldiers in the army of swearbloggers of which he is field marshal
8931636 underneath all the ranting and swearing dk s a very intelligent and thoughtful writer whom many people take seriously despite disagreeing with much of what he says
8931637 the most foul mouthed of bloggers devils kitchen was always likely to provoke sometimes disgust but more often admiration
8931638 i dont mean it literally or even metaphorically i just find that his atheism aside i agree with everything the devil of kitchen fame says i particularly enjoy his well crafted and sharp swearing especially when addressed at self righteous lefties
8931639 spot on accurate and delightful in its simplicity devils kitchen is one of the reasons that were not ready to write off euroweenie land just yet at least not until we get done evacuating the ones with brains
8931640 this hugely entertaining articulate witty scottish commentator is also one of the most foul mouthed bloggers around gird up your loins and have a look essential reading
8931641 the devils kitchen is one of the foremost blogs in the uk the dk is bawdy foul mouthed tasteless vulgar offensive and frequently goes beyond all boundaries of taste and decency so why on earth does dr crippen read the dk because he reduces me to a state of quivering helpless laughter
8931642 dk is a take no prisoners sort of libertarian his blog is renowned for its propensity for foul mouthed invective which can be both amusing and tiresome by turns nevertheless he is usually lucid often scintillating and sometimes illuminating
8931643 if you enjoy a superior anti left rant albeit one with a heavy dash of cursing you could do worse than visit the devils kitchen the devil is an astute observer of the evils of nulabour thats for sure i for one stand converted to the devil and all his works
8931644 this fellow is sharp as a tack funny as hell and when something pisses him off meaner than a badger with a case of the bullhead clap
8931645 foul mouthed eloquence of the highest standard in bad taste offensive immoderate and slanderous f ing brilliant
8931646 i tend to enjoy devils kitchen not only because i disagree with him quite a lot of the time but because i actually have to use my brain to articulate why
8931647 this blog is currently slamming politics certainly aint all my own but style and prose is tight fierce provocative and funny ok i am a child swear words still crack a laugh
8931648 10 000 words per hour blogging output prolific or obsessive compulsive i have yet to decide
8931649 anyone can cuss but to curse in an imaginative fashion takes work
8931650 ive been laffing fit to burst at the unashamed sweariness of the devils kitchen certainly my favourite place recently
8931651 god bless the devils kitchen colourful as his invective is i cannot fault his accuracy
8931652 it made me laugh out loud and laugh so hard and i dont even get all the references i hope his politics dont offend you but he is very funny
8931653 dk himself is unashamedly right wing vitriolic and foul mouthed liberally scattering his posts with four letter words not to be read if youre easily offended but highly entertaining and very much tongue in cheek
8931654 this blog is absolutely wasted here and should be on the front page of one of the broadsheets

8931664 his foot was on my door my hands are in the air he said move and iim going to blow your expletive head off
8931665 immediately the other officer was shocked that he drew his gun with a routine stop
8931666 he said what the expletive are you doing so he put his gun to my head and at that point i was scared for my life
8931667 i repeatedly said i had all my information is in my glove compartment
8931668 if hes wrong ill take action but if hes not wrong then ill support him 100 percent

8931713 i do believe that mccain has to do something to reshuffle the cards shake up the establishment do something unexpected and governor palin has all the kinds of things that mccain might see as a way to shake things up
8931714 i think it would be something similar to dan quayle dan quayle proved to be sort of an embarrassment as a campaigner being thrust on a national stage like that could be very tough
8931715 im very happy here i hope i will win many titles and carry on improving
8931716 examples to follow the club is their home this is my 10th season here and i hope i will continue at least for the same period as them

8931718 i have stopped using a false name i think all parties should do the same
8931719 its a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
8931720 our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these employees during this very difficult time we hope yours and the community follow as well
8931721 this is a very sad day for the institute site family
8931722 i personally live about 10 miles from the plant and i felt it
8931723 our back was turned and it was like somebody shined a giant spotlight on us
8931724 i thought my house was falling down on top of me thats how hard the vibration was

8931727 i am so surprised to hear that question this honestly is the first time ive ever been asked that question im getting married and having children today
8931728 im happy to be here this is one of my favorite places in the world to be i like to watch the conventions on tv i think the stars of the convention should be the people who are being elected
8931729 im optimistic too its a vital time its a defining time im excited about where things are going
8931730 we had a picnic last night i wore jammies and the girls wore negligees and we kind of broke the ice
8931731 shes going to be a little more different and more from the industry standpoint
8931732 i am concerned about the audience and their acceptance time will tell
8931733 anybody with the right brain would say something like that
8931734 this is great for the show ive been waiting for this i really have and people will love her shes great
8931735 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8931736 but one day all of a sudden it just happened
8931737 i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing
8931738 i was just so proud to show off my big old jim mcconaughey and his gift
8931739 i was deciding do i want to have another baby
8931740 thats when matthew was conceived we had tried for 16 years and no baby so matthew was a big surprise
8931741 you better get back in bed get up on the other side of it and get back in this kitchen with a new attitude
8931742 the negotiation with them it was very terrible and very materialistic and was very greedy they were asking for more money and more money and more money i think they were very greedy and i think they were trading with the blood of their sons and daughters
8931743 so far as many relatives i know would say we would gladly repay any compensation money if we could just have our loved ones back
8931744 financial compensation must remain in its inverted commas money cannot buy our families back
8931745 the libyans have achieved what they want and western commerce has got what it wanted too
8931746 i just wish that the needs of the relatives namely a thirst for the truth and for justice would be attended to rather than an alleged hunger for money
8931747 you cant be compensated twice for the same event and whatever it was it was not compensation it was some political device to allow libya to get back into world trade i suppose i dont know
8931748 i cant comment on whether some relatives are greedy i can only say my own conscience is completely clear
8931749 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community where it is in fact a court of nato
8931750 i would rather hear you say that not guilty at the end of the trial than at the beginning
8931751 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
8931752 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court
8931753 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
8931754 we came to see the initial appearance of the biggest butcher of the 20th century in the balkans
8931755 i sincerely hope you are not serious about that date
8931756 i will not plead in line with my standpoint as regards to this court
8931757 this court is representing itself falsely as a court of the international community whereas it is in fact a court of nato whose aim is to liquidate me
8931758 may i hold you to your word that i am not guilty
8931759 we came to see the initial appearance of the biggest butcher of the 20th century in the balkans
8931760 i sincerely hope you are not serious about that date
8931761 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8931762 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8931763 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8931764 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8931765 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8931766 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time
8931767 georgia found it too hard to hold that line when they were seeing what russia was preparing to do
8931768 es k nnte sein dass sich in den n chsten tagen bis zum ende der transferperiode noch etwas tut
8931769 dadurch haben haben wir neuen spielraum den werden wir nutzen
8931770 i will not quit at this moment i will not declare emergency rule i will wait and see tomorrow
8931771 police will still adhere to my earlier order they merely went to post a court order not to clear protesters
8931772 there will be no coup because a coup will not be able to solve the problems
8931773 i am confident that police are able to oversee the situation
8931774 there are now up to three thousand police deployed outside government house
8931775 the duration of the closure will depend on how the situation develops
8931776 hes a fantastic player and under normal circumstances you would not want to lose a player like him
8931777 i want to stress it was 100 my decision to sell him though
8931778 it was difficult for him he almost signed for them once and got dragged back
8931779 i wish him all the best in the world hes a player ive really enjoyed working with and im sure martin oneill will enjoy working with him as well because you cant help but enjoy working with good professionals
8931780 i wouldnt have sold him if i didnt believe at the end of the day we would move this club forward and thats what were going to do
8931781 when you weigh it up its right for everybody the lads done nothing wrong the fans shouldnt think bad about him at the end of the day he wanted it and good luck to him
8931782 despite the fact that to our fans it wont look like a positive move im convinced what will happen in the next two or three days and in the future for this club will be positive
8931783 the owners absolutely committed to the club theres no doubt about that
8931784 its a case of us trying to get the quality we want to bring in its very easy to bring players in at this time of year
8931785 the secret is if youre going to let a good player go to replace him for another player who can maybe take you in another direction
8931786 ooo we take our shirts off so that makes us the best fans in the country
8931787 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8931788 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8931789 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8931790 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8931791 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8931792 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8931793 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8931794 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8931795 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8931796 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country

8931802 jen was glowing smiling and being very friendly as she ate tuna tartare rock shrimp and spinach salad with a glass of wine it was hard to believe this was a woman who just broke up with her boyfriend

8931813 until this hurricane hits the trend has to be higher toward the 120 level
8931814 if this turns out to be a non event the market could really come roaring back down
8931815 it seems there will be at the very least a slight hit to production
8931816 but everything is up in the air until monday or tuesday
8931817 u s oil demand is currently 1 6 million barrels a day lower than when katrina struck
8931818 there is today more u s refining capacity offline for economic reasons than can be destroyed by gustav
8931819 our misplaced trust that the newly emerging web technology would somehow deliver something that is essentially a people process because collaboration and knowledge management is about people not technology the other failure is in our management practices and a missunderstanding about how people work that information is somehow a product a word document for example that like an engine in a car factory is produced by the end of a hard days work theres no return on investment to be had in this paradigm
8931820 it reflects a very tayloristic view of the world where efficiency is to be had by motivating workers to behave in more efficient ways rather than to think smarter certainly you can offer better tools like large intranet repositories with a wealth of information inside but the synthesis of information into knowledge is a difficult task when the person who created a piece of information or a similarly empowered individual is not there to help you know where to look understand what you find and then assimilate it
8931821 the truth of most modern work is that we analyse data and information and reach out to our networks in order to gain access to knowledge we collaborate on ideas and then have a burst of work that reflects the sharing of ideas and of course once we have produced something we then tend to socialise it again within our networks in order to refine the ideas weve produced this is knowledge work in action and people are at the centre of it
8931822 the challenge is that we have been trained and conditioned by the industrial economy to strive for uniformity and to see uniqueness as undesirable variation instead of the essential quality it has become
8931823 how do we create the same thing all over again
8931824 one unintended consequence has been to make the execution of knowledge work essentially invisible making it harder to manage and improve such work attacking that invisibility opens an important path to making knowledge work manageable and improvable
8931825 right now with a storm a possible threat to louisiana we have called all of our soldiers in the army and air national guard to be prepared for a possible alert
8931826 they know they need to be ready at a moments notice
8931827 we are prepping our response vehicles and equipment so well be able to take immediate action
8931828 we are being prepared in case further development occurs right now were looking at h hours if the storm is to hit tuesday that could start tomorrow
8931829 its labor day weekend we know that and a lot of people have plans at this point nothing is set in stone a lot will be decided at that meeting
8931830 were coming up on the third anniversary of hurricanes katrina and rita
8931831 we pray that gustav wont hit us like that but if it does were going to be prepared for it
8931832 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8931833 fears are mounting that russia may restrict oil deliveries to western europe over coming days in response to the threat of eu sanctions and nato naval actions in the black sea

8931838 because of transportation there are people who can live independently who otherwise could not be doing this
8931839 i have to say katie holmes has become so much more sophisticated in so many ways but i think shes in a dip right now i cant explain it

8931884 there are a lot of things that are different between now and what we faced in 2005 when katrina came ashore
8931885 weve had three years to put together a plan that never existed before
8931886 this landfall forecast may be adjusted several more times before this weekend
8931887 while heavy rain and winds would pound the city it would dramatically cut down on the storm surge that was the major reason for the collapse of the levees during katrina
8931888 working toward a full evacuation of shell operated assets in the gulf
8931889 were never going to disrespect another hurricane again in our life
8931890 people who were around during katrina will see the difference in whats happening
8931891 things that happened after the storm made landfall are happening before the storm makes landfall
8931892 hundreds of thousands of mres meals ready to eat and liters of water right here in this state
8931893 we feel we are more ready this year than we have ever been
8931894 in general were finding that state local and federal agencies are tremendously more capable than they were three years ago after katrina
8931895 five years ago we wouldnt even know there was a hurricane out there
8931896 we know that prayer is a very powerful form of petitioning god to assist people in grave times
8931897 it is important that as we pray that we do not feel the effects of a major hurricane that we need to be mindful of others besides ourselves our prayers are not simply that the storm doesnt come our way but that all people will be spared from harm to life and property
8931898 everybody has to join in prayer to avoid these disasters
8931899 we consider with hurricane lili that meteorologically we know that the shallower waters of the gulf were stirred up by a tropical storm that occurred weeks prior to hurricane lili which brought cooler water to the surface thus causing hurricane lili to weaken as it approached the shores of louisiana
8931900 by faith we certainly also believe that gods hand was in that act of nature and his divine providence was at work
8931901 it was an act of nature that caused it scientifically but it was the power of prayer that was certainly also in effect
8931902 my response is that all we have to do is look at the tragedy that took place in hurricanes rita and katrina
8931903 what a fine example of how in the midst of such a terrible tragedy we saw gods hand in the way that he cared for those who were so gravely affected
8931904 if we have a direct hit on acadiana their plans are to have the paramedics here before the storm hits
8931905 our understanding is that they would bring everything they need
8931906 we have a gymnasium and several other places that are pretty large
8931907 well know how to reach them afterwards so we can get them back in immediately
8931908 we will be able to minister to the people after the fact
8931909 first of all we ask that all of our parish priests follow the advice of local civil authorities regarding evacuation and that each pastor take the responsibility of securing all of the buildings and also making sure that the blessed sacrament is brought to a secure place along with all pertinent files and information
8931910 as far as our involvement we will have priests deacons and religious who will be assigned to work at various shelters to provide pastoral care
8931911 burlesque refers to theatrical entertainment of broad and parodic humor

8931914 he was a legend and an institution in the republican party
8931915 no man in louisiana did more for the development of the party in this state than charlie
8931916 i consider him one of the founding fathers of the republican party in lafayette
8931917 hes been an example for the last 30 years of what a good christian conservative republican looks like
8931918 i take a lot of comfort knowing hes up in heaven right now probably hamming it up with ronald reagan
8931919 charlie was practicing family values before family values was the buzzword it is now
8931920 he loved my mother very much and he was a great dad
8931921 when i was young and id be walking home down our street and someone knew i was a degravelles
8931922 theyd say your dad helped me do this thank your dad for the time he did that
8931923 he was a genetic optimist he saw the good in everyone and he very much loved lafayette
8931924 were getting supplies in and watching the storm very closely
8931925 we encourage families to make the arrangements as soon as possible
8931926 as we all experienced in the past communication of any sort during and immediately following a storm is a challenge
8931927 nursing home evacuation and even sheltering in place is a massive undertaking that requires great planning and organization on the part of the nursing home
8931928 as such you should not wait until this weekend to make decisions about a family member in a facility
8931929 weve been working closely with our state agencies in preparation said heritage manor spokeswoman mary arabie
8931930 were looking at our evacuation plan and making sure everything is in order
8931931 weve been in contact with our host facilities transportation services and families of residents

8931935 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8931936 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8931937 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8931938 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8931939 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8931940 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8931941 i came by because i had this speech tonight i wanted to practice it out on you guys see if it worked on a friendly audience

8932108 people were getting into internet dating going to agencies and the like and i just felt there was no one in new zealand who was addressing the issues that constantly came up its not working i cant seem to find anyone
8932109 i promote the idea of saying im single and id like to be a in a relationship its ok to let your intentions be known
8932110 women are so good at analysing we love sitting around and talking with our girlfriends about what he did and what he said and what does that really mean but men are simpler creatures they dont do that
8932111 the best approach women can take is to ask them outright or take it just as it is do something else see other people if that persons interested in you they will pursue you
8932112 or making the opportunity for the man to initiate something
8932113 the thing with internet dating is initially its such a visual thing and im not just talking about how you look but also your screen name and the first few phrases you use if thats not bringing people in you might have to change it
8932114 and then the next time you see each other you might say hi its a nice day
8932115 if you want to get into a relationship or do anything new in your life theres always some risk involved
8932116 you do have to open up you do have to be vulnerable and even if 10 men or women have broken your heart you need to learn from that but you still need to open up and be vulnerable to the 11th there is no connection with someone if you are distant untrusting and aloof
8932117 guys often have this perception they have to be funny or know the lines or whatever to approach a woman they dont need to be like that they need to be themselves
8932118 to be attractive you need to value yourself and you need to see yourself as deserving no matter how you look what actually is attractive at the end of the day is how you come across you need to see yourself with the best eyes first

8932124 it was a massive error of judgement in driving while under the influence of alcohol

8932129 we have discussed the two offers at boardroom level and unanimously turned them down the key factor is that our manager dave jones wants to keep this squad together and believes we will challenge for promotion
8932130 the board decision was to back the manager 100 per cent our stance on offers for key players remains unchanged none of them will be sold at any price
8932131 we have had bids for our players but we dont have to sell we are in a position whereby we can turn down the bids we want to keep joe and he wants to stay he can play in the premiership and hopefully he can do this with cardiff city we have a good squad of players a lot of whom can play in the premiership the best way to keep these players is to try to get there the players are aware of the bids made but want to keep this squad together with joe and roger in it

8932141 aug 29 1842 the treaty of nanking was signed ending the opium wars and ceding the island of hong kong to britain
8932142 this was a speech crafted to rebut every argument the republicans have used against the democrats in past presidential elections and every argument they are preparing or already using against him he went through god and values he went through gun control he went through gay rights he essentially said to john mccain what george w bush is famous for saying bring it on you want to have a debate about judgment and my ability to be commander in chief i will do it now thats risky but you can either hide from your weaknesses or take them on and tonight he took them dead on
8932143 i dont think there is going to be one line that we remember nothing like you know a new frontier i think what we will remember is that this was political theater like weve never seen i mean gosh ive been covering politics 30 more years and i have never seen a politician able to attract 85 000 people the fireworks the speech itself he didnt create an emotion packed speech he didnt really play on the anniversary of the i have a dream speech he didnt really pluck the heartstrings of all these democrats that packed this stadium for this moment of history
8932144 one of the lingering worries among obama supporters and democrats at large about obama is that maybe he doesnt have the stomach for hitting his opponent hard maybe he doesnt think of american politics in a way that will draw the necessary contrast between democrats and republicans i think with that one shouted word tonight enough he put the worries the o bambi worries to rest
8932145 this speech was billed as a very historic speech and indeed it was a historic evening but the speech didnt come through that way across the board there were a lot of very negative parts to that speech for barack obama to suggest that john mccain doesnt have the commitment to track down osama bin laden that we have had him in our sights and decided that it wasnt important to bring osama bin laden to justice is absurd
8932146 it was a great speech but heres a question i have was it convincing that he has the experience to do all those wonderful things he spoke about that is what i wonder
8932147 he did a methodical job and he did something amazing he did it without losing the audience because he didnt just go to just rhetoric of hope and keep everyone mesmerized he went into thick policy thick budget and kept everybody interested and applauding that was a masterful job
8932148 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers
8932149 although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
8932150 we have tried hard to keep electricity prices as low as possible and our increase of 9 is the lowest in the sector
8932151 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office
8932152 i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring
8932153 what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8932154 i cannot help but feel how proud my father would be proud of barack obama proud of the party that nominated him
8932155 its not because john mccain doesnt care its because john mccain doesnt get it
8932156 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8932157 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8932158 on the granular level he stuck it to mccain and he also answered critics who have said he is too soaring and not specific
8932159 i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8932160 i believe this election is close today mainly because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8932161 dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy

8932164 why my child do you ask why well i will tell you why you see the child lives instead of the wind he hears the sound of angels singing before my throne instead of the beauty that passes he sees everlasting beauty he sees my face he was created and lived a short time so the image of his parents imprinted on his face may stand before me as their personal intercessor he knows secrets of heaven unknown to men on earth he laughs with a special joy that only the innocent possess my ways are not the ways of man i create for my kingdom and each creature fills a place in that kingdom that could not be filled by another he was created for my joy and his parents merits he has never seen pain or sin he has never felt hunger or pain i breathed a soul into a seed made it grow and called it forth

8932186 desgobierno que dej como herencia el psoe en la ciudad es el polo opuesto a la situaci n actual donde los servicios municipales han experimentado un cambio sustancial a mejor
8932187 actualmente para el psoe pasan por tercermundistas habr a que preguntarse qu definici n hacer de la situaci n que dejaron en 1995 con m s de 12 000 millones de pesetas de deuda a proveedores de la capital el primer teniente de alcalde en la c rcel y concejales socialistas que se sentaban en los plenos entre el p blico mientras el alcalde dimit a por la falta de confianza de los compa eros
8932188 la capacidad de mimetismo que tiene el psoe municipal cuando habla del modelo de ayuntamiento que ellos impulsar an y la memoria hist rica selectiva
8932189 son de izquierdas pero privatizaron jardines y el servicio de agua
8932190 apuesta por modelos mixtos capital privado y p blico en la gesti n de algunos servicios cuando antes no ten an empacho en privatizaciones puras y duras
8932191 a los pacenses que el servicio de parques y jardines estaba privatizado y en manos de una empresa de la que era titular un ex concejal socialista y que al llegar el gobierno del pp fue municipalizado y funciona a juicio del consistorio muy satisfactoriamente
8932192 de ah que se pudieran apropiar de anticipos previstos para los funcionarios un concejal que finalmente acab en la c rcel as como un interventor procesado a causa de este que finalmente fue exculpado
8932193 mientras en estos momentos est muy pr xima la inauguraci n del nuevo parque municipal de bomberos el psoe dej como herencia unas peque as e inmundas instalaciones y se adapt una central lechera para parque de bomberos
8932194 contaba entonces con escasos medios personal y materiales utiliz ndose transmisores obsoletos vestuario inapropiado armamento desfasado instalaciones precarias mientras ahora existe partida presupuestaria de 3 millones de euros para las nuevas instalaciones de la polic a local de badajoz
8932195 reconoce que hay situaciones que hay que mejorar como ocurren en cualquier otra administraci n
8932196 se est trabajando denodadamente y se espera que algunas reivindicaciones recientes de mejora de servicios tengan una pronta y satisfactoria respuesta para los pacenses
8932197 mientras en la poca del psoe la ciudad viv a una situaci n de aut ntico caos y desilusi n en estos momentos la mayor a de los pacenses se sienten muy a gusto con su ciudad y muy esperanzados con los proyectos y perspectivas de futuro
8932198 but it wasnt bad it was a more traditional liberal democratic speech than he normally gives and that certainly must have turned off republicans it turned off this one let me tell you and might have left some independents cold but being perceived as a generic democrat is not such a bad thing in this particular election year alas
8932199 second obamas speech represents a departure from the way he has constructed the argument for his candidacy
8932200 this will be since ive been here the most un routine a season can be

8932203 what you count on is film study and walk throughs to help them prepare
8932204 what you have to do is you have to understand you do have to adjust your schedule you have to give your guys a chance to physically recover and they have to trust the work youve done through the year that theyre going to understand how to go play a game
8932205 you cant let anyone use the schedule as an excuse as to why youre not going to play as well as you can

8932210 un tripartito del que militantes de los partidos que lo forman se dedican a insultar directamente a los extreme os incluso militantes cualificados como el vicepresidente de la generalitat carod rovira sin que montilla ponga coto a estos desprop sitos
8932211 sin fisuras y mirando el bien com n porque lo que est en juego es el futuro de extremadura y el eje de solidaridad en el que hasta ahora se ha basado
8932212 el pp est abordando con disposici n positiva la negociaci n pol tica para tener un sistema de financiaci n auton mica en espa a y es el psoe el que tiene encontronazos internos no resueltos que hacen que esa negociaci n hoy por hoy sea francamente dif cil
8932213 se ponga del lado de los nacionalistas y siga hablando de solidaridad un concepto que lleva impl cita la subsidiaci n de unas comunidades respecto de otras
8932214 he has tended to do this before he is very much an outsider and he has been in a minority of one literally every month since he has been on
8932215 i would expect that those involved in the financial world would not take what he says as any indication of what is likely to happen in future

8932219 not everybody sings off the same page everyday but we dont co opt people into thinking just one way
8932220 so much damage has been done and we have a lot of ground to make up we just have to have so much intensity to offer an alternative getting it right is important

8932239 its a solid start we needed to get points on the board quickly and weve done that
8932240 trust me my generation is totally behind barack obama but too many of us are still not registered
8932241 and heres the cool thing we wont just tip this one election well bring in thousands of folks wholl keep voting progressive for election after election after election
8932242 what were talking about here is changing politics for the long term
8932243 with the united states facing incredible challenges from abroad these democrats rightly said barack obama did not have the experience and judgment to be president
8932244 then i realized it is more important to be here and explain to the world what is happening what is happening here is in some ways more important than whats happening anywhere else
8932245 thats going to make the pressure for everything extremely high
8932246 its going to be an exhausting process its going to be hard physically to get through it
8932247 you want to capture that big idea and press it at every opportunity with dispatch and gusto
8932248 if youre right to go to barack obama and youre worried about him for whatever reasons then if you hear from your neighbor that personal kind of validation takes on greater importance for barack obama than is typically the case
8932249 is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8932250 we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past
8932251 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans have built
8932252 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8932253 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8932254 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8932255 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8932256 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8932257 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8932258 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8932259 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8932260 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8932261 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8932262 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush

8932268 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8932269 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8932270 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8932271 florida loves to be the center of the political universe and they have certainly reaffirmed that
8932272 i would be remiss if i did not say that i honestly believe that what weve done this year will give us more of an opportunity to really look at this process
8932273 looking at the early signs they have already surpassed my expectations
8932274 the nuances and political mosaic of florida which is complex
8932275 job 1 is to fight for and protect the people of florida especially when these storms come our way
8932276 im not torn at all theres plenty of reporters covering the republican convention
8932277 whether the storm hits new orleans or anywhere along the gulf coast weve been committed to telling the continuing story there since katrina its an important part of our continuing coverage
8932278 we know that conventions these days are mostly for show wallace said
8932279 if we have a major news event were not going to be able to turn away from a major storm hitting the gulf coast three years after katrina
8932280 if he mentions katrina and new orleans and louisiana and puts a big emphasis on it then i wouldnt be
8932281 do you stop life because of weather you have to work around these things
8932282 i know its a tough call but the alternatives are worse i dont know how you reschedule a convention
8932283 the work here is real important that we get it right
8932284 im very much hoping i wont have to cut them off today
8932285 people who go to our shows get really amped but they had nowhere to get plugged in
8932286 when they hear our music we want people to start thinking dialoging and talking about what is going on in our country
8932287 nobody in this band could do this if it werent for a bigger reason
8932288 ever since that moment ive had it in my head i dont ever want to abdicate responsibility in terms of changing the world
8932289 i think this is the biggest demonstration of the week
8932290 this is the most victorious ending i couldve ever imagined
8932291 i had been telling my story for years and believed it to be true
8932292 i see no reasonable basis for this action theyre far outside any time limits
8932293 i dont even play football i wont even be at the game how can i influence the outcome
8932294 sukhumi could easily host black sea fleet ships for instance a naval brigade of up to 30 vessels
8932295 if we cleared up the harbor at the cargo terminal we would be able to station the ships from the naval brigade there
8932296 as far as the six points of the medvedev sarkozy plan is concerned russia has complied with them all
8932297 called into question its commitment to peace and security in the caucasus
8932298 the opposite is true the timely and decisive actions of the russian leadership prevented a destabilization of the entire caucasus region
8932299 violates the territorial integrity and sovereignty of georgia and is contrary to un security council resolutions supported by russia
8932300 ignores the arguments behind russias position in favor of the difficult but only right decision given the circumstances to recognize the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
8932301 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree and i havent spent my career in the halls of washington but i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8932302 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
8932303 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
8932304 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction

8932307 the university of bath is proud that the youth sports trust has chosen our world class facilities at the sports training village as one of the key venues for the 2008 uk school games

8932309 lets hope the athletes at the uk school games can provide inspirational role models for their peers and use the experience as a springboard for continuing success in sport

8932340 holy crap we just nominated a black guy as president
8932341 helping the rich owners pay less while the rest of us pay more than our fair share
8932342 my opponent is one of the wealthiest people in congress
8932343 the shoe leather we have worn out is just incredible
8932344 half the people that came to this town will never see the inside of the pepsi center
8932345 i do believe some of the stuff that vern buchanan is being charged with or investigated for is playing a significant role
8932346 someone has to explain to me what a sanction against russia would consist of
8932347 even in this serious political situation its important to maintain our senses at the end of the day we are still going to have russia as a neighbour and it is in our own interest to return to a normal relationship
8932348 the georgian conflict shows that we must not increase our gas dependence
8932349 we must consider whether we should take similar precautions with gas that we do with oil
8932350 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8932351 it does not surprise me and i think it is a change
8932352 obviously people are very concerned about the price of gas and the consequences of us buying so much of our oil from foreign sources
8932353 now is the time to break from traditional party lines and help alleviate our countrys dependence on foreign oil by listening to your constituents
8932354 i definitely see the allies weve had go the way of charlie crist and others who have traditionally opposed drilling
8932355 i hope i have a reputation of wanting to protect this environment because i do but i also have to balance that as every citizen does with whats happening to florida families whats happening to this economy how dependent we are on foreign oil
8932356 people were telling us you know they dont allow signs
8932357 but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush i say to the american people to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
8932358 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8932359 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine
8932360 these are my heroes theirs are the stories that shaped me and it is on their behalf that i intend to win this election and keep our promise alive as president of the united states
8932361 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain
8932362 they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8932363 so ive got news for you john mccain we all put our country first
8932364 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8932365 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
8932366 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8932367 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
8932368 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
8932369 im always going to remember being a little part of this
8932370 i care about the speech but im probably not going to remember most of what he says standing up here waving the flag talking to everybody around us in the stands all of that makes you feel like a part of something
8932371 i never thought id see a night like this in my lifetime
8932372 we had to apply for credentials and when we got them we knew we would come i mean a part of me still cant believe were here at something as big as this
8932373 something is happening in america and people are prepared and ready to make that great leap
8932374 tonight more americans are out of work and more are working harder for less
8932375 more of you have lost your homes and even more are watching your home values plummet more of you have cars you cant afford to drive credit card bills you cant afford to pay and tuition thats beyond your reach
8932376 i dont believe that senator mccain doesnt care whats going on in the lives of americans
8932377 i just think he doesnt know john mccain doesnt get it
8932378 i stand before you tonight because all across america something is stirring what the nay sayers dont understand is that this election has never been about me its been about you
8932379 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8932380 once the jury has rendered a verdict the senate has a constitutional right to consider the qualifications of the member
8932381 i am not stepping down im going to run through and im going to win this election
8932382 the court case is going to go on whether its finished or not im still going to run for re election ok
8932383 theyve always waited until the legal process is complete and voters had their say
8932384 once theyre elected the only judge of qualifications to serve is the u s senate
8932385 what people want to talk about are issues of energy of health care and of taxes thats where im going to go
8932386 and as we walk we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead we cannot turn back
8932387 we specifically this semester are interested in bringing someone with a political background because of the proximity to the election
8932388 we had hoped to bring someone that had some knowledge and some excitement factor in the political arena and john edwards obviously fit that description at the time
8932389 the simultaneous development of altruistic behaviour and preference of your own group provides interesting new impulses to the conjecture that both of these processes are driven by the same evolutionary process
8932390 we are in the process of talking to the government theyve not indicated one way or the other how theyre dealing with us
8932391 we always worry a little bit but we think our arguments are pretty strong
8932392 yahoo has made it very very clear theyre going to take the best parts of their network and ours and combine them
8932393 all were asking is just to have a little share
8932394 it certainly is our hope that its not a long strike
8932395 but how long the strike will last really is up to the union weve been pretty clear the offer we put on the table is our best offer
8932396 the profits are just the highest that theyve ever been
8932397 miners are average working class folks who are coaches in the hockey rinks and who have kids in schools and who contribute in a significant way to their communities
8932398 its appropriate in times of prosperity to share with those people whose work and labour is delivering those profits to those corporations
8932399 weve lost a lot of members over the years i think we should be well paid for what we do
8932400 theres reason to believe the democrats have been catching up
8932401 i dont know if theyll achieve parity this year but theyll surely be better than they were in 2004
8932402 rednecks for obama workin for the man wholl do more for the working man
8932403 we have thousands of customers and we solicit business just like any other insurance agency
8932404 they do have a valid license to sell insurance policies
8932405 they are just selling the product not creating the product underwriting or setting rates
8932406 dropped by state farm we can help you secure alternate homeowners coverage with large discounts
8932407 the state has run those insurance companies since 2006 and the fact that there are assessments is the states issue and theyve not done a very good job for the taxpayers as it relates to those issues
8932408 we just had the worst set of circumstances you could possibly have
8932409 it would not be in the best interest of the state and it would be devastating to the university
8932410 if we go through a cut the magnitude of what we had last year there will be more layoffs
8932411 its time for some leadership in tallahassee to say if we want to have universities and if we want to have services we have to pay for them
8932412 restaurar nuestra posici n moral de forma que estados unidos sea una vez m s la mejor esperanza para todos que son llamados a la causa de la libertad que se esfuerzan por vivir en paz y que desean un mejor futuro
8932413 esta noche le dijo a la gente estadunidense a dem cratas y republicanos y a los independientes a trav s de este gran territorio
8932414 con profunda gratitud y gran humildad acepto la nominaci n a la presidencia de estados unidos
8932415 conforme a lo que dije anteriormente me niego a pronunciarme
8932416 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8932417 it demonstrates this is going to be a very very close election
8932418 im very confident in where this race is going to end up
8932419 theres never been a poll on this amendment that showed it winning this is pretty much its high water mark
8932420 the focus remains on the supreme court though for now
8932421 no estar all pienso estar en la feria estatal pueden sacar las conclusiones que deseen
8932422 first tom feeney for congress does not identify itself at the beginning of the prerecorded message as the entity responsible for initiating the call second the prerecorded message does not state a telephone number of the entity responsible for initiating the call
8932423 im a shift worker working variable shifts i depend on my sleep to be able to do my job safely and efficiently im a locomotive engineer imagine the disaster were i to fall asleep operating a freight train carrying hazardous materials in your neighborhood due to fatigue from being awoken in my middle of the night on a continuous basis during election season please stop
8932424 todays appointment is a crushing blow to the health and safety of florida women
8932425 an attempt to shore up his base and pander to the extreme right
8932426 when you have cause to disagree with someone across the aisle the loonier the advocate the better
8932427 what were finding with canady is you dont have to yell and scream and jump up and down to be extreme
8932428 it would be my intention and expectation that i would be there until i faced the mandatory retirement age
8932429 he is kind he is compassionate he is fair and hes brilliant
8932430 this is a great day for florida and we hope its a sign of more good things to come
8932431 its important for judges to have a sense of humility
8932432 with people out of work and housing prices falling its surprising that hes held on to that level of popularity
8932433 as floridas economy continues to be in recession as we continue to lose jobs and see record home foreclosures people are waking up to the fact that charlie crist is not providing the leadership florida needs
8932434 false illusion that the governor is not engaged in governing
8932435 the conversation would be that his approval rating in florida is very high
8932436 protects marriage as the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife and provides that no other legal union that is treated as marriage or the substantial equivalent thereof shall be valid or recognized
8932437 every vote every dollar spent and every volunteer hour donated is going to make an extraordinary difference
8932438 you tend to expect a tax reduction proposal to have overwhelming support at least at first blush then as details come in that support may drop off
8932439 the only way to really reform the system is if the legislature says that because of a constitutional amendment we have to look at this now were forced to look at this
8932440 the more people hear about it the less they like it
8932441 i said to myself wow this man could change the country and ive been hooked ever since
8932442 because she knew some of the things im going through
8932443 they cut my speech to a minute and a half originally yesterday they told me two minutes and i guess theyre cutting everybodys speeches i guess theres not enough time
8932444 the man if anybody sits back and listens to him the man is phenomenal hes a genius and hes got a lot of things to offer this country
8932445 ask yourself this question are you better off now than you were four years ago and if you cant answer yes then hes the man you need
8932446 i have no time to do that i wish i did but i work 70 hours at one job and part time at another
8932447 shes in talks to have a guest spot on one of their high profile shows says the insider
8932448 the top choice is 30 rock but if that doesnt work out theyll try to find another show for her to make an appearance on
8932449 a rep for nbc told ok they were unable to confirm the story at this time
8932450 these are the donors who we will need to raise money for senator obama
8932451 youve seen the numbers on the donor side which are nowhere near the potential that could be achieved from the clinton side
8932452 post convention florida should be the poster child for how clinton donors and obamas finance team get along
8932453 the first time we called the list it was tough the second time was tough but weve gotten some commitments
8932454 right now we have five or six helping after the convention we hope to have many more
8932455 there has been no reaching out no deep gestures of appreciation and respect
8932456 im miffed by this and shes working her heart out for him
8932457 people have sort of absorbed all the bad news there is so far and theyre anticipating a turnaround next year
8932458 everybody will be surprised if it ends up being a good holiday season
8932459 i have spoken to both representative harrell and hal valeche and i look forward to working with both of them in the weeks ahead to take back this seat
8932460 we are now focused on our mission to defeat democrat tim mahoney in november it is important we all work together to unite the party and continue building a strong grassroots campaign
8932461 the legal union of only one man and one woman as husband and wife
8932462 it shows this is going to be an extremely close race
8932463 our people are very motivated our supporters understand the importance of the issue
8932464 this is a dead heat race and we havent started talking to people about how bad this is
8932465 its fairly long its fairly confusing and people arent really sure what it does then theres the question of whether it ever makes the ballot
8932466 has taught him something that career politicians often overlook that inconvenient truths must be acknowledged if we are to have wise governance
8932467 because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change
8932468 hes said many times that the primary battle was historic and exciting and that in the end result it would be good for the democratic party that it would energize a lot of people and bring a lot of new people out
8932469 he expected all along that this would resolve itself elegantly and organically and it did
8932470 i think hes very happy with where we are we have a nominee a spectacular nominee and hes going to do everything he can to see him elected
8932471 we think gore can deliver a compelling message on both the economy and foreign policy as relates to energy
8932472 hes a messenger there are a lot of elected officials that voters dont readily accept information from and hes one that they do they think that hes got credibility he has some credibility because a lot of voters believe that if he were elected the last eight years would have been different
8932473 what he has said is that he is not interested in serving in a future administration but that he hasnt ruled out public office and that if he ran for office again it would probably be for president
8932474 he has found a very unique role and platform as a kind of public private citizen able to harness resources creatively to make a huge impact on the climate crisis
8932475 they are counting on the american labor movement for boots on the ground and mobilization and its nice to be thought of that way
8932476 he has a lot of plans but he has not always articulated them in a passionate enough way
8932477 ive seen that message delivered its in his gut he just needs to be doing it more often
8932478 people will vote against their own economic interests out of fear out of demagoguery out of racism
8932479 what the mccain campaign has deteriorated to is scaring away voters it has created an atmosphere where there is fear and hesitance about senator obama
8932480 this election is about whether voters are comfortable voting for obama
8932481 it was apparent at this meeting that the governor did not presume kilpatricks innocence
8932482 to the contrary at this meeting the governor and her staff had prepared a blackboard scenario in which his presumption of innocence was ignored and significantly undercut
8932483 the governor explained that no matter the evidence kilpatrick had to resign because it was making michigan look bad
8932484 there are massive changes taking place on the internet especially in tv for web and social networking which are creating new business opportunities the internet newbies workshop will give delegates the opportunity to hit the ground running with their new online businesses using the latest tools and technologies
8932485 we are planning for our convention to open on monday
8932486 like all americans we are monitoring the situation closely in the gulf
8932487 you would have to dramatically change the nature of what you do much less partisan much less political
8932488 these storms have a tendency to change and so i dont have a scheduling update for you now
8932489 if its a major hurricane i think that they certainly need to show they learned lessons from three years ago both from a policy and perception standpoint
8932490 the republicans cant seem to catch a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8932491 public messaging and attention to the public affairs part of the response is going to get added attention
8932492 the american people want to know the people they elected are paying attention care about them and are making decisions they need to make
8932493 the smart thing is not to poke their chests out and say what a great job theyre doing or going to do but just to do what needs to be done
8932494 id love to tell you that the opening ceremony was a show of money well spent
8932495 didnt the government promise that drainage would be a priority during these periods
8932496 the best parts of big arts festivals like this are the encounters that happen informally if not spontaneously on the edges random meetings casual conversations pleasing coincidences
8932497 its odd that a country with a tt 45 billion budget and a desire to become a developed nation by 2020 cant figure out how to fix its drains
8932498 served as my eyes for six years while i was working on my memoir
8932499 did not want his speech to sound like a reading of the platform
8932500 too partisan a tone he thought the appeal to the country should not be partisan
8932501 i hope that no american considering the really crucial issues facing this country will waste his franchise by voting either for me or against me solely on account of my religious affiliation it is not relevant
8932502 the world is changing the old era is ending the old ways will not do it is a time in short for a new generation of leadership new men to cope with new problems and new opportunities
8932503 a pledge to the status quo and today there can be no status quo
8932504 there are obvious parallels with kennedy facing a religious test and obama a racial test and both then and now we had a republican administration that for eight years had allowed problems to accumulate and people to lose heart
8932505 as for whether this momentum will continue past next week im somewhat skeptical
8932506 there is a bit of buying around these days but we still havent seen the turnover so we cant say theres a return of strong interest in the market
8932507 whatever was going to blow away has already blown away
8932508 prices are going to go up pretty soon youre going to see increases by 5 10 15 cents a gallon
8932509 if we have a katrina type event youre talking about gas prices going up another 30 percent
8932510 it is simply impossible to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall
8932511 the chances of hurricane force winds within the next five days are essentially the same at each individual location from the florida panhandle coast westward through the entire coastline of louisiana
8932512 im hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
8932513 my daughter got to vote for her mother for president
8932514 unterst tzung erhalten die mitarbeiter von der politik und den betroffenen st dten
8932515 was ich beklage ist dass wir einst ein stolzes unternehmen hatten das die vorst nde zu einer schmutzbude gemacht haben
8932516 barack obama got a special deal from a convicted felon
8932517 theyre going to have to extend the length of the vice presidential debate to two or three hours because i dont think hes going to be able to fit his part of the debate in just one hour
8932518 were almost like rowan amp martins laugh in when we get together i got my little digs in she got hers some of the people who have seen early copies of it have said oh my god did she say that but they dont understand our family
8932519 and was preaching about eating the right food doing chores and taking care of ourselves to the point where sometimes i felt like i might as well be living in a convent
8932520 it was sort of a nuts and bolts how to win an election for women young people
8932521 we started with a ghost writer but then he ran away for good
8932522 but in recalling events we realized that even though we grew up in the same family we perceived things a little differently so we decided to arrange it thematically
8932523 sometimes the three of us would be in the same room other times i would write something up and then richard would call and ask questions
8932524 he was great because he knew how to organize us
8932525 then again i was the one who was pushing her telling her that she couldnt fail
8932526 but the latinas in congress are still pulling their hair out
8932527 hes a great father but was he a great husband no but that wasnt my relationship with him it was something i had to come to understand
8932528 she would embellish the words of his sermon with the wisdom culled from her own experience grandma told me
8932529 i actually didnt tell them until school ended because i didnt have the heart
8932530 are a chunk of change out of the wallet each month
8932531 our families are not living from one paycheck to another in terms of paying their student tuitions and seem not be feeling the economic pinch yet
8932532 on the one hand the parents are having a hard time
8932533 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no
8932534 apparently we like to see romance not only on screen and stage but in real life politics too
8932535 theres a benefit to being seen as someone whos starstruck in love
8932536 people are generally cynical about politicians but we want to like our leaders and seeing them as members of a couple really does work to humanize people
8932537 its a piece of a larger image question and that is is this a person of character we want to believe that our presidents are good people and not just wise men we want the families to represent something that is good and wholesome about america even though many presidents disappoint us
8932538 its wonderful to have a husband that says his wife is a big part of his life
8932539 everyone likes the knight in shining armor that gets the girl
8932540 by showing respect to michelle hes showing female voters what kind of man he is
8932541 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
8932542 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
8932543 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
8932544 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
8932545 tonight i am in awe not so much by what he said but what he obama is doing accepting the nomination for president
8932546 it was very exciting to see the speech that my father gave 45 years ago be a part of this historic event

8932714 insufficiently supported in that he had not taken into sufficient account the torture suffered by binyam
8932715 todays judgment discloses the shocking fact that the foreign secretary failed to give any proper weight in secret submissions he made to the court to the abhorrence of torture when he purported to determine that it was in the public interest not to disclose the evidence of ill treatment to our client
8932716 the court has given the foreign secretary a further chance to reconsider his position before passing judgment we await his response with interest

8932768 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell
8932769 but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8932770 dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8932771 the bush mccain foreign policy has squandered the legacy that generations of americans democrats and republicans have built and we are here to restore that legacy
8932772 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8932773 thats not the judgment we need that wont keep america safe we need a president who can face the threats of the future not keep grasping at the ideas of the past

8932783 because defenders of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8932784 cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8932785 set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8932786 same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third

8932820 i think we had a pretty good car and weve learned some things over the year plus with it being right there at the chase this is a good time to get some momentum dale jr hasnt had much success at california its a tough track for us we often run good but just dont have the finishes
8932821 its been a good season for us and im glad that were in a position to still make the chase and have a really good shot at it

8932909 jonathan crutchley founded manhunt with his life partner larry basile
8932910 it means youre always looking for the better or the best
8932911 this is the negative effect of a culture where people spend lots of time looking at pornography and judging each other primarily based on naked pictures of each other you always think theres something better because youre seeing it its out there so why shouldnt you hold out for somebody whose looks are everything you dream of
8932912 the nightmare that gay people always have just underneath the surface the fear that im just my dick im just my body im just my age it reduces everybody to statistics youre presuming that nobody will love you for yourself if youre offering yourself as just a bunch of statistics

8932943 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8932944 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8932945 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them
8932946 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8932947 john mccain stands alone in his stubborn refusal to end a misguided war
8932948 i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons
8932949 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time

8932959 we will as a matter of urgency review these documents and within the constraints of national security follow up any matters arising especially as they may pertain to any allegations or evidence of irregularities or wrongdoing relating to the arms deal
8932960 clear up the matter of the south african governments co operation or lack thereof in the investigations into the arms deal
8932961 by accessing the mlas we would be able to hold government to account in terms of whether it assisted the german and british investigations
8932962 we believe that the german investigation was abandoned because of a lack of co operation from south africa and we suspect that the british investigation may likewise also be ended due to a singular lack of assistance from the government
8932963 a legacy of problems that will extend far beyond the 2009 elections
8932964 in the light of the further information which has now been disclosed by transnet there is no reason to believe that the sale of shares to lexshell was unlawful in any way or that the transaction in question saw assets being disposed of by transnet substantially below value or in otherwise irregular circumstances

8932969 in the view of busa preferential procurement enterprise development and the industrial policy action plan provide the best platform for the creation of sustainable smmes and broad based black economic empowerment

8932983 our building has been custom designed at many levels to foster collaboration and innovation both within the team and with cisco employees and customers around the globe through the use of ciscos telepresence technology and unified communications and collaboration tools

8932985 with the irish education system driving the development of a highly skilled workforce we have recently completed a graduate hiring cycle this involved meeting with students from irish and international universities and we have many graduates already joining us over the coming months
8932986 apple is cool can anyone even recall a microsoft ad no
8932987 in the weeks ahead well launch a campaign to address any lingering doubts our customers may have about windows vista
8932988 it is simply outrageous that this mountain of information was not better protected and it is equally outrageous that we are hearing about a possible six million additional individuals and businesses six months later
8932989 we fear a substantial number connecticut residents are among this latest group had the hundreds of thousands of connecticut residents affected been notified immediately that their data had been compromised they could have taken steps to protect themselves
8932990 nothing in the data we were given in may and june by bny mellon indicated in any way that these additional six million individuals and businesses were involved
8932991 this certainly raises serious additional questions about how secure personal identifying data is at the bank of new york mellon and widens the scope of our investigation
8932992 as long as the price is not creating a negative the bad guys can use dirty virtual money because sales of goods and services orchestrated by a spam campaign will clear their funds
8932993 we have plans to continue to expand and to open further sales offices in mainland europe over the coming years with multi lingual staff who understand the local business markets and culture

8932997 we have never neglected our core gamers we still have developers working on popular core gaming franchises but we need longer to complete these games approximately two to three years these games are not ready to launch in early 2009 but are being worked on by all development teams
8932998 technology represents one important way in which businesses can effectively reduce their carbon footprint overheads and exposure to rising fuel prices
8932999 tenho muita esperan a de que ele vai at o fim agora que hillary clinton se posicionou e declarou seu apoio a sua candidatura

8933002 shipments into ireland by our uk based distributors as savings from economies of scale grow it makes more sense for us to feed our volume business from stocks in the uk as opposed to having dedicated irish stock
8933003 looking at ways to improve the efficiency of local irish distribution via uk stockholdings
8933004 on track to achieve our targets for this half of our financial year april to september
8933005 in a tough market youve got to focus on profitability because thats what pays the wages and keeps the lights on
8933006 strange stuff going on vis a vis pricing its very very difficult for anybody to make money in that space now
8933007 we know what needs to be done to get 15 market share but were not prepared to spend money to get that market share as it would be at a loss
8933008 we had forecast the deficit at r3 8bn because the rand weakened quite a bit against most currencies so exports should have done better
8933009 the oil price was at a record high so obviously this contributed to the figure
8933010 produces a curtain of falling water with gaps at specified locations
8933011 a pattern of pixels created from air and water instead of illuminated points on a screen
8933012 throw a ball at the wall and then see an open circle drop down to meet it precisely where and when its trajectory intersected the water surface
8933013 now that the kids are older its much easier because they can help and they can pick out and its not me racking my brain thinking how can i serve them a nutritious lunch and what are they gonna eat
8933014 its kinda iffy you know when you add up the amount of groceries the fact of the matter is im probably gonna eat the watermelon for breakfast and for dinner as well and still have enough for five lunches
8933015 i have one child that absolutely refuses to buy lunch she prefers her own thing every day so weve accommodated her these years my younger one also i just see a lot of wasted food so i figure if i can just pack them a smaller amount of healthy foods its just better for them
8933016 we are negotiating with both and they are going at the same speed
8933017 the mahdi army suspension will be valid indefinitely and anyone who does not follow this order will not be considered a member of this group
8933018 we have set a cultural program for the madhi army and we have named it al mumahidun supporters of the mahdi and everybody should abide by it and whoever does not agree with it will be expelled from the army
8933019 if you look out the window and say the grass needs to be cut its too late
8933020 experience is what you get when you dont getwhat you wanted
8933021 prosecution may not be in the interest of all parties
8933022 we decided to request the united nations to invoke article 16 of the statute of the international criminal court to defer the indictment of the president
8933023 we had a great meeting the owner is absolutely totally committed to the club there is no doubt about that and it is a case of us trying to get the quality we want in
8933024 the secret is to pick the right ones its to make sure if you are going to let a good player go you replace him with another quality player who maybe can take you in a slightly different direction as a team
8933025 thats the challenge we have now and i look forward to that i would think there is a very good chance of getting three or four players in
8933026 mike can only give us the ammunition that is the finance we have got to go and find the players and they have got to be the right players
8933027 so far we havent seen a massive influx of players into the club
8933028 but i dont think any newcastle fan would argue that the ones we have fetched in they see as quality and see as the right sort of players for newcastle united players who care and players who are putting a shirt on and doing a good shift for the club
8933029 that will continue to be the way we look for players and if because we cant get those sort of players we dont fetch the volume in and a fair number so be it
8933030 you are so happy because you have a little bundle of joy in your life
8933031 i even find myself going to wal mart looking for little toys when im going grocery shopping looking for food im getting baby food instead of food for myself
8933032 i know for a fact that portman is in the running
8933033 we love this country too much to let the next four years look just like the last eight
8933034 on november 4th we must stand up and say eight is enough
8933035 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8933036 we meet at one of those defining moments a moment when our nation is at war our economy is in turmoil and the american promise has been threatened once more
8933037 these challenges are not all of governments making but the failure to respond is a direct result of a broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8933038 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush has been right more than ninety percent of the time
8933039 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 per cent chance on change
8933040 when john mccain said we could just muddle through in afghanistan i argued for more resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists that actually attacked us on 9 11
8933041 you know john mccain likes to say he will follow osama bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8933042 we are the party of roosevelt we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
8933043 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8933044 doesnt reward the lobbyists who wrote it but the american workers and small businesses who deserve it
8933045 today we face essentially the same choice we faced in 2000
8933046 john mccain a man who has earned our respect on many levels is now openly endorsing the policies of the bush cheney white house and promising to actually continue them the same policies all over again
8933047 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man
8933048 if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8933049 senator obama this is truly a good day for america
8933050 how perfect that your nomination would come on this historic day tomorrow well be back at it but tonight senator job well done
8933051 the question for the american people is whether they can make this odyssey that democratic delegates to the convention made seeing barack for who he is neither white nor black but a man who can be president
8933052 sees the fundamental cause of the worlds problems in the very expansion of homo sapiens
8933053 once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches this transition
8933054 the question simply put is will we seize the opportunity for a change
8933055 why is the election so close its close today because the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change that barack obama represents
8933056 and then let us leave here tonight and take that message of hope from denver
8933057 and do everything we can to serve our nation our world and our children and their future by electing barack obama president of the united states of america
8933058 the republicans cant seem to get a break when it comes to august and when it comes to the weather
8933059 involved engaged and getting briefings and working to make sure that the federal assistance is there
8933060 now is the time to prepare yourself your family and your friends
8933061 one of the most important lessons we learned after hurricane katrina was that there is no substitute for awareness and self help especially in the days before a hurricane is predicted to hit
8933062 orangina is a drink which is mainly aimed at children and young people
8933063 the almost sinister portrayal of animals in an animation style filled with sexual innuendo leads to very mixed and confused messages
8933064 the same policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8933065 were corrupting more and more people to care about this stuff
8933066 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8933067 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time
8933068 sen mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time
8933069 obama took sky high expectations and brought them down to ground level with a tremendous political speech that tried to connect with the concerns of average american voters
8933070 he managed to mix boiler plate policy proposals with american stories and values into a road map for the fall campaign it will take a few days before we know whether voters think obama hit a home run here in denver tonight but by any measure it was a big success
8933071 he made the argument that he is qualified to be commander in chief which is one of the criticisms that has been made against him because of his judgment not his experience and again he questioned john mccains judgment but if this speech is successful for him it will be because he got through to people who are worried about their kids education who are worried about whether theyre going to have health care and he talked a lot about that
8933072 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else
8933073 in washington they call this the ownership society but what it really means is youre on your own out of work tough luck no health care the market will fix it born into poverty pull yourself up by your own bootstraps even if you dont have boots youre on your own
8933074 i realize that i am not the likeliest candidate for this office i dont fit the typical pedigree
8933075 tonight we are gathered here in this magnificent stadium in denver because we still have a dream
8933076 i will cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8933077 as good a show as denver put on well out do them tenfold
8933078 republican or democrat this is a must see event and i cant wait for all the people and excitement to hit downtown st paul
8933079 but even if it doesnt increase sales at all its going to be fun to be here for a once in a lifetime event
8933080 a body immersed in a liquid is buoyed upward by a force equal to the weight of the water it displaces
8933081 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8933082 when he walks out onstage tonight in front of 75 000 to 80 000 people hes a very tangible symbol of whats at stake in a presidential election
8933083 anyone who looks at al gore and whats happened over the last eight years knows whats at stake
8933084 im leaning obama but im still mad its a childish mad but there it is
8933085 i wasnt going to let my disappointment stand in the way of being at what is an historic event
8933086 if an injustice is done and you sit by and dont do anything about it then youre just as guilty of that injustice
8933087 i saw the corruption of the film festival circuit and i said you know what ive had enough im starting a film festival of my own the artists whose voices arent being heard whose works have literally been hidden underground in their basements they have a place now
8933088 for me that was like the straw that broke the camels back
8933089 hey man great news you got into a film festival
8933090 john was like wow thats great what festival is it
8933091 there are some films in the festival that i dont particularly like
8933092 some of them display a certain immaturity for instance but at least those directors had the guts to make a movie and their films will be shown here thats the secret to our success we show the films
8933093 brazil was too hot and sunny the people were too skinny too beautiful
8933094 we were shooting je ne sais quoi here at the bad waitress and i burned a huge hole in one of the tables
8933095 it was a guerrilla production and i was using all these china balls one of which started a fire
8933096 this country needs someone with his intelligence honesty and values
8933097 i feel strongly that this country needs to change direction
8933098 we need a president who puts barney smith before smith barney
8933099 eight years ago some said there was not much difference between the nominees of the two major parties and it didnt really matter who became president
8933100 our nation was enjoying peace and prosperity some assumed we would continue both no matter the outcome
8933101 but here we all are in 2008 and i doubt anyone would argue now that election didnt matter
8933102 we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8933103 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families
8933104 we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8933105 the experience lincolns supporters valued most was his powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8933106 in 2008 once again we find ourselves at the end of an era with a mandate from history to launch another new beginning
8933107 and once again we have a candidate whose experience perfectly matches an extraordinary moment of transition
8933108 if you like the bush cheney approach john mccains your man if you want change then vote for barack obama and joe biden
8933109 no no jimmy stewart for governor ronald reagan for best friend
8933110 john mccain was able to weave in his experience in a vietnam prison camp no matter what the question was
8933111 its much better than talking about how hes changed his total character between being a senator a kind of a maverick and his acquiescence in the last few months with every kind of lobbyist pressure that the right wing republicans have presented
8933112 i would hope that the democrats could have enough senators elected in november so that we would not any longer need to include joe lieberman among the senators
8933113 sportsmen have been stereotyped as concerned with one issue guns but if you listen to sportsmen as i have over the years we hear a different story
8933114 democrats are all about conservation they are all about preservation i think thats a huge opportunity
8933115 with sen obama you have a lifetime record of supporting gun control voting for gun control speaking out against gun rights and voting against gun rights either as an elected official or a private citizen
8933116 it was definitely the longest speech ive seen him do and he did pull on a lot of heart strings
8933117 i would have liked to seen it more fact based but hes definitely leadership material
8933118 im a bit of an environmentalist so i really enjoy his movies and lectures he is a tad full of himself though
8933119 i really enjoyed governor schweitzer of montanas speech because he seems very down to earth
8933120 i really enjoyed hillarys speech as well talking about how her campaign and baracks campaign are about helping others it was really classy
8933121 he got over his personal conflicts with obama and stepped up and did what was right for the party and the country in typical bill clinton fashion
8933122 the carbon based interests oil and coal have a 50 year lease on the republican party and theyre drilling it for everything its worth
8933123 some of the best marketers have the worst products and this is certainly true of todays republican party
8933124 this election has never been about me its about you
8933125 its a moment in our history that well never forget
8933126 most times people are offering thousands of dollars to get out of politicians speeches
8933127 this election is actually not close at all among younger voters
8933128 it suggests cocoa products may have a positive impact on cardiovascular risks
8933129 children are very cruel and theres a lot of stigma attached to appearance
8933130 this was an unusual case but the parents had been through every other option available
8933131 i dont think bullying victims should be changing their appearance or anything about themselves to please the bullies
8933132 even if the ingredients arent harmful at often exorbitant prices they could remove more cash from your wallet than wrinkles from your skin
8933133 some of the most confusing questions in skin care concern the use of vitamins and antioxidants such as vitamins a c and e and ubiquinone coenzyme q10
8933134 in theory the use of these substances in moisturizers and other cosmetics makes sense
8933135 we hope that in the coming years we can reduce the number of children who suffer from malnutrition in this country
8933136 barack obama is ready to lead america and restore american leadership in the world ready to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the united states barack obama is ready to be president of the united states
8933137 the republicans said i was too young and too inexperienced to be commander in chief sound familiar
8933138 it didnt work in 1992 because we were on the right side of history and it wont work in 2008 because barack obama is on the right side of history
8933139 if like me you still believe america must always be a place called hope
8933140 i went on a trip to europe with my father and mother
8933141 and everywhere we went we were met by vast crowds of people hundreds of thousands of people who came out into the street because they wanted to be near to an american politician and it wasnt because his brother had been martyred three years before
8933142 our nation was the most loved nation on the face of the earth because we were regarded as an exemplary nation
8933143 it took 230 years of discipline restraint and visionary leadership by republican and democratic presidents to build up those vast reservoirs of love and adoration for the united states for the past seven years through monumental arrogance and incompetence we have drained those reservoirs dry anyone who thinks its good for our country when hezbollah is more popular in the middle east than the us has their head in an oil well
8933144 his life has been the 21st century incarnation of the american dream
8933145 the way to influence behavior like that is to first raise peoples level of consciousness
8933146 we know were not perfect but were always striving to do the best for the environment
8933147 there is currently no company policy about opening or closing doors but we acknowledge the need to minimize energy use and are investigating different strategies such as using air fans which would prevent the cold air from leaving the building even with the door open
8933148 i would say something about it we are the customers and so i think they would value hearing from us
8933149 i would probably go in and say were all trying to conserve energy pasadena is a very green city so it would be best if you didnt pour your air conditioning into the outside world and i might say that im not inclined to shop in a place that hasnt caught on to the green spirit of pasadena
8933150 hillary told us in no uncertain terms that shell do everything she can to elect barack obama
8933151 that makes two of us actually that makes 18 million of us because like hillary i want all of you who supported her to vote for barack obama in november
8933152 candidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8933153 there are not many papers that go right to the core of some of the assumptions of democratic theory the way this one does
8933154 c andidate dialogue does not seem to help anyone learn during a campaign
8933155 we must seize this opportunity to elect united states of america
8933156 if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis
8933157 the same policies those policies all over again hey i believe in recycling but thats ridiculous
8933158 we are facing a planetary emergency which if not solved would exceed anything weve ever experienced in the history of mankind
8933159 take it from me if it had ended differently we would not be bogged down in iraq we would have pursued bin laden until we captured him
8933160 we would not be facing a self inflicted economic crisis we would be fighting for middle income families and we would not be denying the climate crisis wed be solving it
8933161 the forces of the status quo are desperately afraid of the change barack obama represents
8933162 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the future of human civilization
8933163 sea levels are rising fires are raging storms are stronger
8933164 after they wrecked our economy its time for a change
8933165 after they abandoned the search for the terrorists who attacked us and redeployed the troops to invade a nation that did not attack us its time for a change
8933166 powerful ability to inspire hope in the future at a time of impasse
8933167 barack obamas vision and his voice represent the best of america
8933168 it is that common american identity which barack obama exemplifies heart and soul that enables us as americans to speak with moral authority to all of the people of the world
8933169 gov crist now has an opportunity to make a lasting impact on the florida supreme court much like president bush has been able to do on the u s supreme court
8933170 hell be able to pick people who reflect his judgment and his conservative principles
8933171 theres no better way to accentuate your beliefs than with appointments to the court
8933172 this has not been a partisan court if i thought we were getting ideologues on the court id be concerned
8933173 sectarian and discrimination became very hot topic in the blogs and we are afraid to become another iraq or lebanon so we toke the challenge to put something for limiting this hate speech
8933174 why we should put limits while we dont have any right now
8933175 the code was written in a general words which can be explained or understand in different way and it will be like trap for the online activism
8933176 a political party that believes that it is my right as an american to varnish in an unventilated room comedy centrals stephen colbert explains in this interview
8933177 the campaign is going good about 6 percent across the country says barr a former republican congressman from georgia who left his party he says his party has gotten a spot on the ballots of 48 states
8933178 disgruntled hillary supporters who say they will vote for republican john mccain
8933179 i dont think the disgruntled hillary supporters would be big on bob barr
8933180 the next six months are going to tell the story
8933181 basically a true story but it just hasnt happened yet
8933182 a thrilling spectacle but ultimately distances the public from the problem
8933183 we were interested in blurring the lines between fact and fiction
8933184 its very important that the program is clearly labelled a drama and not a documentary
8933185 even though the chances of climate change are significant there are processes in place to manage the consequences
8933186 the bottom line is our cities are not going to run out of water
8933187 this movie is to climate science as frankenstein is to heart transplant surgery
8933188 the power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man that premature death must in some shape or other visit the human race
8933189 a terrifying glimpse of the none too distant future when climate change will force the worlds powers into a desperate struggle for advantage and even survival
8933190 there is a probability of wars including even nuclear wars if temperatures rise 2 to 3 degrees celsius
8933191 my background is 30 years in the strategic field and i look at this stuff and the potential for huge disruption to internal relationships and international relationships to me looks enormous
8933192 there is a range of possibilities here thats why these scenarios are not mutually independent each one is a free floating possibility and they depend on the amount of change that you have got but that basically is a question of dates
8933193 i dont imagine people reading this book will be empowered or disempowered to the extent that it will make a whole lot of difference to the balance of outcomes
8933194 im not a pessimist i dont think these are foregone conclusions we are on a large highway and there are any number of exits off this highway that we could take and avoid the bridge thats out down the road
8933195 but there are no guarantees that any of them will be taken and further down the highway very bad things will happen if the exits arent taken
8933196 it is presumptuous in my view to suggest that we know where we need to be in 2050
8933197 this wont solve our energy problem by itself so there is no point in doing this
8933198 weve got plenty of oil to get us through the short term while we move to electricity
8933199 some chapters begin with a quotation please dont assume that my quoting someone means that i agree with them think of these quotes as provocations as hypotheses to be critically assessed
8933200 i have a major problem sending so much money overseas in order to purchase oil from folks who dont like us
8933201 rather than speeding up the use of our own oil why not put our emphasis on lowering our overall use
8933202 were going to have to get off petroleum sooner or later
8933203 just take an objective look at the continuous string of incidents at existing nuclear facilities and you will have to admit that what works great on paper falls a bit short in the real world leaks fires spills sleeping security squads
8933204 solar and wind along with possible tidal and geothermal will do the job
8933205 this crisis would not have happened if the beattie bligh government had listened to frontline clinical staff
8933206 seriously sick and injured people do not need their hardworking doctors and nurses to be distracted by a tirade from an incompetent minister
8933207 they have every right to make public comment however i think theres a responsibility on everybody that they provide accurate advice
8933208 thats silly but the word crisis must certainly be one of the most overused words in the political vocabulary
8933209 what i believe is a crisis is when the system is going backwards when you have beds closing medical staff resigning when you fail to keep pace with the numbers coming through the door youre in free fall
8933210 what we have in queensland health is in fact the opposite
8933211 there is pressure when the system is working to capacity
8933212 when it has gone beyond capacity in my opinion that is a significant issue it is dysfunctional it is a crisis
8933213 the investigation of a babys death in october 2007 remains open because there are still questions surrounding the circumstances of that babys death
8933214 we all felt it was the crib that caused the passing
8933215 other studies have suggested that there are differences between men and women in response to different antidepressants but the evidence has been conflicting
8933216 this study is large enough and we were able to control for enough complicating factors that we feel confident there is a true difference these results have clear implications for the clinical treatment of depression
8933217 the divestiture is necessary to preserve competition for advertisers who buy broadcast television advertising time in the richmond market
8933218 without this divestiture advertisers on local richmond stations would have paid higher prices

8933229 the 17 point lead never existed everybody gets a bounce out of the convention
8933230 you know that youre going to be watched by more people than have seen you before that time
8933231 we tried to celebrate the notion that it would be a more open inclusive caring government
8933232 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
8933233 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
8933234 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
8933235 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
8933236 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
8933237 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
8933238 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
8933239 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
8933240 we should be working with law enforcement right now to make sure that we protect people against people who are not capable of knowing what to do with a gun because theyre either mentally imbalanced and or because they have a criminal record
8933241 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
8933242 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
8933243 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
8933244 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
8933245 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
8933246 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
8933247 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
8933248 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable
8933249 there are the hard core more conservative ones who will vote for him but hold their nose
8933250 s di certo tra le cinque squadre che potevamo incontrare il benfica la pi difficile per qualit storia tradizione organico e palmares ha giocatori importanti ed anche un blasone di rilievo internazionale e un club certamente abituato a questi match di grossa levatura europea ma anche noi possiamo essere allaltezza del compito

8933261 convention 3 starring president bush and vice president cheney begins monday in st paul
8933262 mccain at first seemed happy enough to do the interview but his mood quickly soured the mccain on display in the 24 minute interview was prickly at times abrasive and determined not to stray off message an excerpt
8933263 i have voluntarily entered a facility for the treatment of sex addiction i ask for respect and privacy for my wife and children as we deal with this situation as a family
8933264 earwax is not intrinsically evil stuff and consequently does not have to be removed merely because its present
8933265 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
8933266 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
8933267 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
8933268 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
8933269 why does it always snow when im going to talk about global warming

8933271 the water problem is so severe for adelaide that it may run out of water by early 2009
8933272 mother nature in the form of planet earth is about 4 5 billion years old way older than even madonna
8933273 when people rightly complain about higher gasoline prices we propose to give more money to the oil companies and pretend that theyre going to bring prices down
8933274 i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
8933275 the greatest transfer of wealth in the history of mankind
8933276 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
8933277 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
8933278 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
8933279 but it appears that the democratic party at the top is hopelessly in the grip of corporate interests that favor war free market nostrums and corporate welfare
8933280 if id wanted to vote for a republican id vote for the real one every time
8933281 the same fate she would have suffered had she won the nomination
8933282 lets vote for ralph and fuck up another 4 years with mccain
8933283 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
8933284 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
8933285 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
8933286 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
8933287 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
8933288 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
8933289 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
8933290 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
8933291 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
8933292 an issue that deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts always loved that adjective noun pairing what is an untrue fact from all sides and not just propaganda from one
8933293 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
8933294 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual
8933295 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
8933296 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
8933297 education is a companion which no future can depress no crime can destroy no enemy can alienate it and no nepotism can enslave
8933298 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
8933299 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
8933300 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
8933301 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
8933302 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
8933303 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
8933304 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
8933305 we came late so we wouldnt have a line and we havent had a line yet
8933306 lige nu st r de to konkurrenter til mellem 46 og 44 procent i flere meningsm linger langt fra situationen i slutningen af maj hvor obama solidt var foran med syv procentpoint
8933307 the most powerful country in the world to the weakest
8933308 why do they dislike intelligence in this country in leaders
8933309 senator i knew abe lincoln abe lincoln was friend of mine senator youre no abe lincoln
8933310 its a very ugly syndrome in democratic politics because its a scapegoat syndrome
8933311 i dont think this country deserves a least worse choice
8933312 its decaying its lost its soul they never talk about the poor they talk about the middle class
8933313 service us in all kinds of ways while they are underpaid while they are overcharged
8933314 its our job to sweep the rascals out of the political forums who have corrupted our country
8933315 almost everything we like about our country started with minority dissenters
8933316 we will let the people of connecticut know that even though obama is likely to take it they at least have a choice to send the democrats a message that their votes are not going to be taken for granted
8933317 i saw squirming politicians and i saw free speech in action
8933318 that was a far greater civic education than anything i learned in my formal education
8933319 if only you knew the power you have at this young age
8933320 re comcast to limit customers broadband usage we just got comcast we had insight which was much better it makes me want to switch
8933321 comcast said it was setting a monthly data usage threshold of 250 gigabytes per account for all residential high speed internet customers or the equivalent of 50 million e mails or 124 standard definition movies
8933322 re comcast to limit customers broadband usage that company is so arrogant my step father got switched over to them from insight and
8933323 comcast said it was setting a monthly data usage threshold of 250
8933324 why dont these bloody people just knock their nonsense off
8933325 as perplexed as people whod togged up for a fancy dress party and gone to the wrong address
8933326 at their age i was disdaining the opportunity of a free university education in favour of loafing and trying to scratch a living as a rock journalist theyd voyaged halfway around the world to fix a busted country
8933327 the soldiers swept their rifles back and forth up and down then gathered in a corner
8933328 this is ridiculous observed rana correctly we stopped so did the soldiers i told the one who seemed to be in charge that he was spoiling our walk youre spoiling our patrol he grinned
8933329 who arent doing smart things that they should or are doing daft things they shouldnt
8933330 point 4 the palestinians get properly organized and stop being so silly and the israelis cease acting like jerks
8933331 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8933332 john mccain will pay hundreds of dollars for his own shoes but were the ones who have to pay for his flip flops
8933333 and for the sake of our economy our security and the future of our planet i will set a clear goal as president in ten years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8933334 and democrats we must also admit that fulfilling americas promise will require more than just money
8933335 what does it say about your judgement when you think george bush has been right more than 90 percent of the time
8933336 the idea that were responsible for ourselves but we also rise and fall as a nation
8933337 ive been criticized for saying he inspires me to hell with my critics
8933338 he took the last 8 years of the bush administration and said enough
8933339 i thought it was riveting i thought it was stunning he really did a fine job
8933340 he did everything he was supposed to do it was really inspiring
8933341 full of meaning and full of opportunity and if you as i believe and i know a lot of you do we did not lose the last election nor did al gore lose his last election we won it
8933342 ill screw around on my sick wife and make her lie in front of the cameras about it
8933343 if hes the answer then the question must be ridiculous
8933344 barry goldwater ran for president and he lost mo udall ran for president and he lost bruce babbit ran for president and he lost for this next election thats one arizona political tradition id like to see continue
8933345 john mccain calls himself a maverick but he votes with george bush more than 90 of the time thats not a maverick thats a sidekick
8933346 i will always call him governor bush because thats the last political office he was legitimately elected to
8933347 and it is now under investion they were fixed computors
8933348 there are too many republican robber barons in this nation and they exist and survive vy the use of the worst deceptive practices and tactics paying out to those whod sell their souls to put their republican puppet in the white house to enrich themselves and destroy america and its middle class and its working population these robber barons need to be crushed to a pulp to save america and its leadership in the world
8933349 fewer believe that those provided the margin of victory or that kerry was robbed of victory the way democrats think gore was robbed
8933350 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
8933351 i think whats going to raise the comfort level of coal miners is that barack obama is from a coal producing state
8933352 he has worked with the illinois legislature on coal issues we feel comfortable with that and the fact that john mccain is proposing 13 new nuclear plants doesnt do us any good at all i think barack obama will appropriate money for clean coal research and technology and carbon capture and sequestration which is what were going to have to do we have to face the reality of the climate change issue and we are becoming a greener society but we need to be a part of that i dont think coal is going to go away for a long long way
8933353 they take it for granted they think maybe electricity is just something that comes out of the wall
8933354 were making sure they see the shoddy record that sen mccain has when it comes to veterans when it comes to labor unions and when it comes to working class folks
8933355 we dont tell our members how to vote well tell them it starts from the ground up who we think would be the best candidate for the membership its our job to put the information in their hands i think theyll make the right decision
8933356 we would really like to see some blue at the end of the tunnel this year
8933357 i think its normal that a player says that he wants to leave and in the case of robinho i accept that as being totally normal it seems to me that its a mistake but its his problem
8933358 over time wall street firms began to trade against their clients for their own account such that now the direct investment activities of a firm like goldman sachs dwarf their activities on behalf of outside customers
8933359 a thirst for oil comes back to haunt a nation of gas guzzlers
8933360 think of it this way the people having the most kids today are uneducated and poor so within a few years we will have a pretty dumb country
8933361 i agree with so many of you but particularly with
8933362 tell this headline to every uneducated person from a third world or
8933363 let this limited children initiative start with the third world countries and the islamic families that are currently trying to out produce the rest of us in order to take over
8933364 i wish i had know this before we had three
8933365 as usual another bible thumper that cannot offer proof to back up his beliefs
8933366 to muttonhead31 since you asked i will respond by repeating myself look around you
8933367 that mountain is not really there everyone is just imagining it
8933368 mixdown it is not a personal attack it is math
8933369 to mixdown you believe there is a god and thats what this country is all about but show me the proof that u speak of
8933370 about the argument over being frugal with resources in having more than two kids
8933371 to the jackal if you cant find proof that god exists then you are blind
8933372 wowsers this from scientists that are generally left of center politically and all in favor of the usa becoming north mexico in a few years
8933373 i recently saw a item on this on pbs and was shocked at how soon this is goign to become a global problem
8933374 i cant believe that people get so up in arms about the suggestion that they not have huge families i have chosen not to have kids and am regularly attacked for the decision by people who do choose to have them
8933375 charlie hustle you should run for president on that platform
8933376 in america we have generations of welfare recipients who beleive the more kids you have the more the government will reward you so why would they ever stop having children besides how else would the women be able to buy those new 24
8933377 i myself have only two children but i resent the premise of these arguments
8933378 it is about time someone took this thought process public in a more aggressive manner
8933379 theres nothing out there man you go take a picture of nothing
8933380 james wont be ready for the bench on saturday he is still a little way off and with the international week ahead i dont have to force it through
8933381 i want james to be fit firing and raring to go so that when he does get back in the side he keeps his place however he is also well aware he needs to earn the right to get back into the team

8933419 such a string of mishaps and missteps might throw another electronics company into crisis but of course apple inc isnt just another electronics company
8933420 there was no going back at that point but after i sold it i quickly started to regret it
8933421 apple which declined to comment for this story said little as complaints rolled in then released a software fix it said would improve the devices ability to connect to 3g networks since then users on various sites have reported no improvement
8933422 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
8933423 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
8933424 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection
8933425 our study shows that preterm infants make incomplete and or delayed recovery from interruptions in breathing
8933426 inability or delayed recovery from repeated low oxygen episodes can also be detrimental to brain development
8933427 there is increasing evidence that infants exposed to prenatal cigarette smoke are at high risk for developmental and behavioral disorders

8933433 and in the race to stop global warming hes a friend of our planet too
8933434 john kerrys been fighting for thirty five years to protect our environment
8933435 there is a little bit of desperation perhaps but we are on top of the situation and still talking
8933436 hes a very good player and as juande ramos has said many times were delighted hes with us
8933437 in some voters it will continue to be an issue
8933438 and it has been ever since barry goldwater ran against lyndon johnson in 1964 and thats the reason that the republican party has been so successful in the south
8933439 if barack loses by that amount theyll say its racism
8933440 if they asked me id say spend your time in ohio or some of these other states where its going to be very close
8933441 if we could win arizona this year it would set such a milestone for the democratic party we would bury the republicans for 25 years
8933442 but ive been here before folks if anyone can screw this up its the democratic party
8933443 there were two words no convention speaker in 2004 could say george bush
8933444 if you cant defend yourself then you sure cant defend the american people
8933445 are going to make the swift boat ads look like public service announcements
8933446 we cannot afford four more years of failing economics and a falling economy for the change we need to lift working families across our nation for the change we need to ensure the american dream is within reach of all of us we must send barack obama to the white house
8933447 space based solar power as an opportunity for strategic security

8933451 everything that was broken in last years game is largely if not entirely fixed slowdown good as gone in over ten games in multiple stadiums we barely noticed it
8933452 the weathers dynamic too so showers mutate into downpours as play progresses with weather dependent on the country and stadium
8933453 to date no lawsuits have been filed against united artists or mr cruise nor have any allegations been made of any involvement of mr cruise in this incident
8933454 all press reports and comments to the press stating otherwise and designed to generate sensational headlines are false
8933455 mr cruise ms wagner and united artists entertainment did not exercise reasonable care to select a reasonably competent experienced careful and properly equipped contractor
8933456 oh yes you are remember how you did that one thing once that was creative

8933458 im absolutely delighted with our growth this year which is in complete contrast to the general property market trend which is in serious trouble right now our customers are choosing to improve their homes to achieve a higher property value for when the market stabilises and starts to recover and adding a conservatory is a great way to do this
8933459 protect yourself from real estate and mortgage fraud preserving the american dream of homeownership
8933460 i audit hundreds of real estate files every year and this file takes the cake
8933461 if anyone is looking for a trademark signature of mortgage fraud i think theyll find it in what has already been reported by crains detroit business and the detroit free press from fabrication of bruce mcclellans assets and making outrageous claims about mcclellans guaranteed return on his investment to making no real attempt to sell the investment property and taking cash back at closing here as reported by crains detroit business and the detroit free press we have what appears to be a very questionable situation
8933462 what lindsey hunters company is under investigation for having done has the potential to ruin lives destroy neighborhoods and is quite possibly significantly calculable in our current mortgage meltdown and housing crisis
8933463 our partnership with penner law firm will give our clients access to on call attorneys in other words if our clients have any questions or concerns these attorneys will be able to offer consultation and advice at virtually any time and place for the actual real estate closing our clients will no longer have to travel to the attorneys office to sign the necessary documentation
8933464 scheduling a closing is sometimes problematic many attorneys do not open their offices on the weekends which can be the most convenient time for many borrowers other attorneys simply lack the resources or staff presence to engage in mobile closings attorneys are needed in the office and have little time to travel this usually places the burden on the client with mobile closings this burden will be eliminated attorneys will be available to meet our clients at their convenience in order to complete the signing of loan documents
8933465 were not just in town for the next year to develop a piece of property finish it and leave this is a long term commitment for us
8933466 we want our residents to feel like theyre in a mountain home tucked away amongst nature in the east tennessee mountains
8933467 one of the things that weve done since we started and will continue to do is work with local contractors and businesses that are based in the community
8933468 with the decrease in home prices over the past year the valley now has a wide range of homes that are a terrific bargain
8933469 we are working with a variety of clients first time home buyers local residents moving up investors and second home buyers to make the most of these great values while they last theres too much promise and growth here for home prices to stay low
8933470 at farrell fine homes we have the philosophy that one size certainly does not fit all each client has a different background different needs and a different perspective
8933471 our agents are trained to go the extra mile and we continue to provide a high level of customer service long after the close of escrow
8933472 from fountain hills to litchfield park we know just about every nook and neighborhood in central arizona
8933473 i honed my marketing skills selling our city as a top destination
8933474 i now apply those skills to successfully selling homes no matter what the market condition
8933475 yo he dejado de usar una identidad falsa y creo que todas las partes deber an hacer lo mismo
8933476 i think it is impossible for him to play for england
8933477 this will be his first start and he certainly wont be on for more than an hour after that he will need a recovery period so i think it is very very unlikely that fabio would risk him
8933478 pipeline and barge providers of crude oil do not serve eastern kentucky or tennessee in this geographic area there is a significant underserved marketplace for the buyers

8933483 newcastle want to keep michael owen but they are only prepared to offer him another year after his contract runs out at the end of this season
8933484 i would think weve got a very good chance of getting three or four players in
8933485 the money from milners transfer will be available to me
8933486 but the money was there to buy players even if we did not sell james milner
8933487 were looking for three or four to bring in and i think well get them
8933488 we have four or five irons in the fire with two of them quite far down the line
8933489 but mike ashley can only give us the finance we have to get the right players in
8933490 its now a case of getting that quality in before monday
8933491 you got lets of offers of players at this time of year but the secret is to pick the right ones
8933492 if youre going to let players go you have to make sure you replace them with quality
8933493 no one will argue that the ones weve got in so far are quality
8933494 they are players who care and put the shirt on and do a real good shift for the club
8933495 but we are in a great position at this club because we have not got any deadwood
8933496 some clubs are looking to move five or six on but were now just looking to add to our squad
8933497 kevin revealed there are two players almost through the door right now with 4 5 others in the fire
8933498 but we are in a great position at this club because we have not got any deadwood
8933499 listen pal i dont see you as good enough in the long term but can you put in a shift for me
8933500 no not really because when i got the part i was playing henry v which has a similar sort of iconography within the theatre canon
8933501 i thought this was just a natural progression in a sense because he has had some wonderful actors playing him in the past but i wasnt too worried about that and i just figured providing i stuck to the script and did what i could to the best of my ability things would be fine
8933502 i was most excited on my mothers behalf as well because she had always been a big fan of colin firths rendition of the character and i was more pleased to be able to tell her i wont die in this and also im playing a guy that you kind of dig quite a lot
8933503 obviously being my mother that had a different spin on this time but that was one of the pleasures of taking the role
8933504 historically with a few exceptions presidential timber is what we call it has been from either the senate or governorships
8933505 i mean we havent had a great deal of respect in getting anyone elected president except dwight d eisenhower and he made his fame outside the state
8933506 some of his views are just a little too far to the right

8933514 because the economy of the east of england is more diverse now than it was in the past it is also more resilient and better able to deal with difficult times when as they inevitably do come along
8933515 over the past few years the east of england whose 110 billion 450 000 business strong regional economy is the united kingdoms fourth largest has overtaken other areas to become the countrys top location for private sector research and development
8933516 the east of england also plays a vitally important part in the economy of the uk as a whole our ports which are the countrys gateway to europe currently account for 53 per cent of its container capacity and more than 20 per cent of its port employment

8933652 american dream feels like its slowly slipping away ive never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up
8933653 we are seeing a growing trend within our broadcast customer community to use more and more open standards based it infrastructure where possible this provides economies to them not just in infrastructure costs but more so on the training and ongoing maintenance as well as enabling multipurposing of infrastructure
8933654 quantum stornext is not just open but also best of breed when we combine it with an innovative tool like david systems hac it enables a broadcaster to retain their specialised media workflow requirements whilst at the same time take advantage of standardised infrastructure and the benefits this brings
8933655 the hac from david systems allows stornext to recognise the time code requests from broadcast specific software and provides partial file restore from the archive
8933656 on a larger scale across the whole organisation this will certainly help alleviate unnecessary loads being placed upon both network and storage infrastructures

8933663 stoll field has had a very interesting history once it was truly a field and later it was used for military barracks
8933664 despite its past stoll fields strongest connection may be with uk athletics history and the countless football games that were played on the grounds
8933665 stoll field in 1880 the first college football game ever played in the south was held here at what was eventually named stoll field it was dedicated in 1916 at the kentucky vs vanderbilt game and was named in honor of alumnus and long term board of trustees member judge richard c stoll the field was the setting of early football games and an integral part of student life class of 2007
8933666 mclean stadium this field which once pastured president pattersons cows was used for military training during wwi and in 1924 it held mclean stadium it was named for price mclean an engineering student who was fatally injured in a football game in 1923 mclean stadium was the site of kentucky football games until they were moved to commonwealth stadium in 1973 class of 2007
8933667 there are many places on campus where i can feel uks history but few that inspire as many images in my mind
8933668 current students may only see stoll field as a place for marching band practice and i hope that the placement of this marker will reveal the historical significance of a portion of our campus landscape
8933669 i vividly remember in 1970 looking inside our defensive huddle on a key third down play against a nationally ranked kansas state football team and hearing our defensive captain saying in the huddle this is why you came to uk to play in front of 40 000 fans at stoll field lets show the people that we can defend our house
8933670 during my era stoll field became our house and even though we lost more games than we won we always defended our house and the other teams didnt leave stoll field without a fight
8933671 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them

8933691 the best way to prepare your child for school is to introduce books at an early age
8933692 it took me a while to get my timing back and i had to iron out a few things right after christmas it seemed like things turned 180 degrees i got my game back on track and had a real good run towards the end of the season unfortunately we lost to the spokane chiefs in the first round
8933693 its kind of opposite styles but he was my guy growing up i was a canucks fan growing up when i first got into hockey they made their run to the cup final and they were the only canadian team to go real far
8933694 going into the draft i kind of had a feeling there was a chance i might end up here
8933695 luckily enough i did its nice and close to home unfortunately for a lot of my friends and family who are from up north a lot of them have to convert to flames fans its been great and its obviously a great organization im really liking it here
8933696 theres all sorts of pressures whenever youre coming into an nhl camp no matter where youre drafted
8933697 being taken in the first round adds a little bit more but its not something you can let get the best of you ive just got to keep things as simple as i can and try not to do too much sometimes when i do that things get a little scrambly in my game and im not positionally sound
8933698 my goal my game plan for next year is to win a national championship
8933699 whatever that takes obviously ill do it i just want to become a more consistent well rounded player thats definitely something i have tried to work on
8933700 i feel like maybe im in the best shape i have ever been in
8933701 i took a full schedule last year so these two classes will put me ahead of the curve a little bit which will be nice
8933702 hopefully maybe it will lighten the load a little bit next year instead of taking five classes taking four second semester when we will be traveling more and hopefully away for long periods of time with tournaments and stuff
8933703 its nice to type papers too it just sort of goes along in the background
8933704 its not my favorite genre but its not as bad as i had first thought going into it
8933705 knowing how it goes and having done it last year helps knowing what it takes to really not play hockey for a few months and hopping in with the best players in the world its definitely a shock that first year
8933706 i think everyone knows whats expected and what we have to do
8933707 obviously some of the guys that are coming to camp this year were there last year they didnt make the team but they have experience being at that the camp obviously we were not happy with fourth place so we will definitely be pushing the envelope for sure
8933708 fourth place was not what we were thinking of so we have to do better
8933709 hes a big kid hes got good hands and he likes to go to the net
8933710 were looking forward to seeing him develop and hopefully sooner than later see him playing for us
8933711 i like to go to the scoring areas but i dont score very many pretty goals
8933712 hes a good kid and a really clever hockey player
8933713 obviously he has a little bit of a feather in his hat being on the memorial cup champion anytime you win a big team award like that it certainly is something you can draw on and reach back on just to experience the adversity you go through itll be something he can draw back on for a long long time
8933714 hell come into the main camp and try to make the big club hes good with the puck and a really smart player hes a good skater hes pretty much the whole package hell make some noise in camp
8933715 for the life of me i cant figure out why he was not invited to the initial tryouts with the world junior team with team canada hes trying to change their mindset and hopefully hell get another look come christmas time
8933716 he went through his junior career with a lot of injuries
8933717 he got through last season healthy this will probably be his most productive summer in quite some time hes not nhl ready yet but we see definite signs of progress

8933794 y por eso toda comunidad cristiana debe tomar estos valores y aplicarlos en sus programas pastorales
8933795 la iglesia existiendo en el mundo y por el mundo si bien no es del mundo no puede olvidar su misi n de testimoniar la vida cristiana en el mundo

8933801 the workers and the executives were afraid and worried and our foremost priority was to ensure their safety hence the management decided to evacuate its manpower from the plant late last evening
8933802 since the employees and contract labourers had left the plant late last night it was a conscious decision of the company that there would be no attendance at the project site at any of the three shifts today
8933803 were pleased to have formalized this relationship to create trilink systems with mr kershner and mr paris as we look at the global demand for power and energy paired with grass roots movements towards alternative and renewable energy sources we believe that this is a strategic decision that positions bridgeborn and trilink for both near and long term success
8933804 this relationship with trilink will also allow bridgeborn to grow our international business and increase the user base of bridgeworks powered solutions through existing customers such as johnson and johnson usaid and the emirates simulation academy bridgeborn solutions have already been deployed to over 35 countries
8933805 the projected growth in the international power and energy marketplace speaks to the tremendous opportunity and need to infuse new solutions to contemporary problems by creating this relationship with bridgeborn trilink can call upon bridgeborn for high end it services and solutions in support of our growing customer base
8933806 additionally bridgeborns unique data visualization capabilities and proven solutions such as their training delivery platform address the education needs in this marketplace as the aging workforce begins to retire both hal and i are pleased to be part of the bridgeborn family and are confident that this relationship will be very successful for years to come

8933815 if roman will agree a contract then we are ready to let go him go if roman begins to play in england this will be good both for him and for the team
8933816 i could not decide if i wanted to go to england at first first yes then no
8933817 the only thing that stopped me from leaving was my family but now all doubts are behind me and i decided to sign a contract with tottenham and the formalities are practically settled

8933826 we have decided to protest today outside central zoo authority because people generally believe that animals are very happy staying in a zoo which is not true wild animals should be set free in their natural surroundings and all these incidents of killing of animals in zoo and the recent incident of deaths of two bears in nagaland has forced us to stage a protest today
8933827 people here read local newspapers because they get the information of the local happenings besides getting information of the neighboring places all the small and big news what is happening is that every nook and corner of the district is also covered by the local papers so the people go for it
8933828 most of the problems of the area were not being highlighted this is one of the most important causes many newspapers have come up
8933829 guns wont solve our problems they will only destroy the society we should restore peace in the society through the pen

8933837 arshavins transfer story is taking too long it has already lasted six weeks and i wont deny it has had a negative impact on our team and our results as well
8933838 this is really good news for me and my team i hope we will all be able to play in good style against manchester and achieve positive result
8933839 the verdict has disappointed me and my family members we reject the verdict
8933840 we had also rejected the verdict of the trial court we expected justice from the high court but the high court also disappointed us
8933841 the verdict has disappointed us we wanted justice from the high court but we did not get it killing inside jail is a very sad matter
8933842 the acquittal of the convicts who had killed the four national leaders so brutally will encourage criminal activities in the country
8933843 this verdict does not seem appropriate to us it did not seem logical to me to ignore what has taken place with the knowledge of all
8933844 i think if justice could not be ensured in such killings the politics of killing would continue in the country
8933845 it need not be said that the verdict did not do justice to the case the killers definitely were involved with their local and foreign patrons otherwise it would not be possible for them to enter an well protected area like jail and continue the killing spree for a long time
8933846 this would boost our tourism in himachal there are various varieties of apples and apple products we are also making an effort to tell people about our cuisine
8933847 its a great fun and cool experience yeah its cool because you come to know that this place sells so many apples so they make it a big festival when they give apples to tourists and all others it shows a kind of good gesture i like it

8933912 se plantea un cuestionamiento sereno ya que desde la tica y la espiritualidad surgen una serie de elementos que llevados a la pr ctica nos platean en qu sociedad estamos viviendo como por ejemplo qu modelo econ mico nos rige y qu efecto tiene en las actitudes y vida de cada uno de nosotros y tambi n plantea una pol tica de estado sobre la relaci n social y el ambiente en que vivimos
8933913 frente a la amenaza ecol gica que estamos viviendo hoy d a un modelo neoliberal tan extremo y tan desencarnado como el que se est llevando adelante en chile creemos que es altamente perjudicial por la destrucci n de la naturaleza y sus recursos especialmente del agua dejada en manos de empresa particulares que ciertamente lo que buscan es el bien propio y no tanto el bien com n

8933930 the scale of this criminal enterprise is unprecedented in this country
8933931 the roll call of deaths and injuries is horrific some 30 to 40 of these weapons are still unaccounted for and regrettably but doubtlessly the roll call of death and serious injury will continue to rise

8933934 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
8933935 me asombra la facilidad con la cual a partir de estos hechos se estigmatiza al pueblo mapuche como un todo cuando quienes vivimos en la regi n de la araucan a y conocemos al campesino de esta etnia sabemos que se trata de personas emprendedoras cuya principal preocupaci n radica en sacar adelante a sus familias y en poder trabajar para conseguirlo tal como cualquier chileno
8933936 conozco al pueblo mapuche he visto como se desconocen sus derechos ancestrales he compartido con l desde mi primera infancia he alojado en sus comunidades y s que son los chilenos a los cuales la sociedad otorga menos oportunidades y de los cuales m s se abusa esto llega al punto de que cuando el estado les asigna recursos como ocurre con el programa or genes hay una corte de intermediarios y consultoras de partidos pol ticos que tienen como conducta permanente aprovechar en propio beneficio los dineros que se destinan al pueblo mapuche
8933937 mientras hay subsidio para plantar rboles en los campos de la araucan a y as desplazar a las ciudades al mapuche no hay subsidio para que estos campesinos puedan siquiera mantener una agricultura de subsistencia ello es inducido por las pol ticas de gobierno para expulsar al mapuche de sus tierras y fr amente desruralizar la araucan a
8933938 la injusta estigmatizaci n que cierta prensa hace del pueblo mapuche el aprovechamiento de ciertos pol ticos de los recursos que la ley destina al pueblo mapuche y la desruralizaci n impulsada desde el estado forman parte del clima contrario a la generaci n de paz social que nuestra araucan a necesita para dejar de ser la m s pobre del pa s y ser la regi n perdedora de la cual hablan los organismos internacionales
8933939 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
8933940 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
8933941 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas

8934100 the latest gvmt website is a social network discussion board poorly thought out and ill defined pseudo web2 0 project that lets people have their say about id cards surprisingly enough the board contains little other than people pointing out what a deplorable idea see here for example so this post is just to say thanks hmg for spending my taxes on this i assume you looekd into the matter carefully and established that previously there was no facility anywhere on the web for people to comment on id cards

8934102 in fact server logs reveal that this is one of the most common reasons searches fail users often provide only a vague description of what they want worse still in testing we found that users had difficulty recognizing when their searches weren t well phrased and they tended to blame the poor results on the system not themselves

8934110 ive had a good day and ive never had such a good rhythm on these roads before obviously being first on the road wont be so easy on saturday but im sure its going to be ok
8934111 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8934112 they were pretty much hustled off they came right down the ramp jumped in some vans here and off they went
8934113 john mccain is going to make the choice from his heart hes going to choose someone who can be a partner in governing hes going to choose someone who brings character and principle to the table and who shares his priorities and im confident that hes going to make a great pick
8934114 why wouldnt you when you live in a country where you can back whichever candidate you want and no ones going to kill your family for it
8934115 change happens because the american people demand it because they rise up and insist on new ideas and new leadership a new politics for a new time
8934116 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8934117 what the people heard people of every creed and color from every walk of life is that in america our destiny is inextricably linked that together our dreams can be one
8934118 im crying because i was around when martin luther king died and when john f kennedy died and its a long time since then and a long time to get back the dream
8934119 this is history i will tell my grandchildren about this
8934120 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief thats a debate im ready to have
8934121 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even go to the cave where he lives
8934122 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8934123 i worked on the hillary clinton campaign for a year and ive come to the realization that hes the one to change this country
8934124 but lets hope that americans are going to address the problems that are bedeviling the country
8934125 noi siamo qui ha detto obama perch amiamo troppo questo paese per lasciare che i prossimi 4 anni assomiglino agli ultimi otto anni
8934126 he is very happy to be here and wants to thank the irc
8934127 now he can sign his name and knows some of the alphabet so he can try to get a job
8934128 owing to a well founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race religion nationality membership in a particular social group or political opinion is outside the country of his nationality and is unable to or owing to such fear is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country
8934129 theres a natural cap in the town with the three agencies handling resettling here theres only so many apartments doctors offices the infrastructure can only handle so much flow
8934130 its like putting water through a pipe you can only get so much through
8934131 each agency has its very own unique personality and philosophy about how refugees are resettled but in the end we all receive the same federal funding and we all have to adhere to the same standards and requirements for resettlement
8934132 because of the smallness of ior it gives us the ability to be a little more progressive and creative in providing services
8934133 frequently idaho is on the cutting edge of refugee services in the whole country
8934134 we are im sure one of the mainstays of their income because the three agencies are placing 400 to 500 apartments a year jones said
8934135 the refugees walk in the door tired and confused and theres sheets on the bed there might even be flowers on the table theres food in the refrigerator their education starts the moment they get off the plane
8934136 irc likes the volunteers to go over to the house and look around and see if there are any problems
8934137 check the refrigerator make sure that theyre properly preserving their food that they dont have any food sitting in cupboards because theyre refugees they dont waste any food so theyre never going to throw it away
8934138 a real challenge is comparison shopping because the refugee camp always handed them stuff
8934139 they have no more concept that two similar things could sit side by side on the shelf and that for some reason youd be paying twice as much for one as the other so trying to explain that and to see if they understand it is very difficult
8934140 once i taught them the bus schedule they were on the bus all the time when i would come over for my weekly visits they werent saying ok can you drive us to the grocery store can you drive us here they had already done it
8934141 i was over at their apartment and somebody came by to sell them a cable plan it was funny because they opened the door and they welcomed him in they thought that he was just a friend or neighbor
8934142 television is a really great way to learn english except and ive heard this about other refugees too they like the spanish language channel
8934143 i speculated it had something to do with the over the top soap operas
8934144 most people when they think of a language class think grammar and vocabulary for us language is being able to navigate your environment whether its riding the bus whether its finding out about a concert all of that really is language
8934145 a person cant become culturally integrated or culturally adept without language and they cant get the language without the culture
8934146 our classes are very informal in that as much as possible wed like for them to reflect a social gathering and not a formal classroom the type of language we use every day isnt academic its more like composing music than it is doing mathematics
8934147 if youre just looking at language acquisition nothing else because of the trauma refugees have been through and because they didnt choose to come here it creates a different set of needs than any other language learner has
8934148 a lot of times people will seem disinterested not motivated to learn the language and thats a very common symptom of post traumatic stress disorder
8934149 theres a technique called emdr eye movement desensitization reprocessing its a simple technique that activates both sides of the brain
8934150 were combining it with art therapy to help them release traumas without actually having to talk about the trauma were working with a counseling group to also do the same technique with the parents because you cant work with the kids and open them up like that and go home to a chaotic unstable environment
8934151 were right at 200 students already we found last year that we were at about 66 percent refugees so its probably close or might have crept up even higher to 70 percent this year
8934152 the kids become what we call cultural brokers and they become the helpers of their families in so many ways helping them navigate how things work and of course theyre acquiring the english language typically at such a rapid pace
8934153 some of the parents theyre taking english classes too and certainly trying but the children really are the information sharers
8934154 at some point in the last few years we had had refugee groups that were so far removed from american culture that we realized we just needed to spend that much more time with them so the classes have become 12 weeks
8934155 eighty percent of refugees are women and children a lot of the women that are coming are single moms these women have to work theres no choice and theres no support network for them so the faster we can get them employed the less vulnerable they are the less vulnerable their children are
8934156 we have a lot of iraqis coming some of them are very highly educated speak english very well and have very high expectations of employment
8934157 everybody agrees that the more times the information is given in different ways at different junctures of someones experience when they first come in the better it is going to be for them theyre going to be better prepared
8934158 we wanted to set it up so we could focus on here are the rights that you have living in the united states and then here are the responsibilities that go along with those rights
8934159 when the new americans get here i teach them about the laws of this country and focus on the ones that are really different from where theyre from the big ones are probably domestic battery child abuse statutory rape depending on the countries that they come from those are completely different laws that dont even exist
8934160 maybe they didnt have running water or maybe they didnt have electricity which may not be a police problem but when they think that their landlord has turned off their power not realizing that maybe a light bulb has burned out then they call me i had one little boy call 911 because his mom wouldnt make him pizza to him that actually was an emergency
8934161 our desire is to get health advisers from every cultural group so they can give us input on how we can improve services within their culture were working with different community agencies to solidify and make sure that we are doing what we can and not reinventing the wheel
8934162 theyll go through law enforcement training so that they have an idea whats expected of them using those individuals as our interpreters then maybe well get to have some insight into the way their culture works and how in those high stress situations how we can handle it better
8934163 many times former refugees become interpreters maybe theyve gone through the resettlement process or they might have spoken good english to begin with each of the agencies really engages bilingual people and provides training opportunities for them to become effective interpreters
8934164 will probably have to increase its offer to the iam given whats at stake for boeing
8934165 boeing is in a position where it can increase its labor cost base revenue remains strong with large backorders
8934166 those facts plus the fact that boeing can not afford any more delays in the 787 program means the iam has the upper hand in these contract negotiations im sure the machinists dont want a strike either so my call would be for boeing to up its pay raise offer to 6 5 and 5 for a 16 pay increase

8934207 we are trying to make as many passengers as possible aware of their options in terms of alternative flights and the possibility of securing refunds for the flights they booked with zoom
8934208 we have been in contact with other airlines including ba british airways virgin and flyglobespan in particular and they have made clear the availability of alternative flights
8934209 we would like to reassure people that yesterday every possible effort was made to save the airline and safeguard flights and it was only very late in the day when the actions of suppliers and creditors made it impossible to continue

8934232 one who experiences a past of boy scouting never quite gets over the thrill and excitement of those days gone by in preparation for adult life
8934233 it has been one of the most enjoyable work of my life i sure know what it means to work with the boys and i am sure they enjoyed every minute of it also
8934234 i think they said it was because it would be easier for an adult to complete the rank and do the work but thats not so
8934235 my dad he did everything we did he had to follow us boys over every mountain and through every creek we could find in those days he showed us by example
8934236 i liked swimming and being in the river we always enjoyed hiking and camping and all the things scouts do
8934237 really i think i learned a lot of the things i learned in the bible too treat each other with respect do unto others as you would have them do unto you
8934238 he said he had never had an eagle scout stand before his bench
8934239 that tells you something about the quality of people that become eagle scouts
8934240 i firmly believe that our boy scouting experiences and training had much to do with where our family is today our father took the much appreciated time to spend with his boys each sumer as well as throughout the year both parents kept us in church where they were our youth leaders and taught us everything by example they showed us the way
8934241 weve all had a good christian life all the girls we dated were without question good christian girls and its just been a good life
8934242 they invite the best from each camp and then its up to the girls and their families whether they will attend or not
8934243 it is really exciting for our girls to get invited this is a first for us its a great opportunity for them
8934244 we get to spend a whole day in disney world
8934245 we get to spend new years eve at universal orlando and we get to have a pool party with all of the invitees that attend and then we will perform at halftime of the bowl game on new years day
8934246 we have sent out letters to local businesses requesting donations and weve had a yard sale a bake sale and were doing doughnut sales
8934247 as long as we raise the money we are going to go on this trip
8934248 i am very proud of their presentation at the camp
8934249 i think they were so successful because of their experience they have been doing this since middle school
8934250 they know they were capable and they got to see what the real thing is all about watching the camp instructors they saw the degree of difficulty that professionalism takes they watched the intensity and saw how much dedication and hard work it really takes
8934251 cortney fields is the newbie on the team and she worked extremely hard for her invitation

8934253 when they got invited they looked at me and said were going
8934254 theyre really working hard and if they can keep on pace and get the community spirit involved i think they will do it

8934257 sesungguhnya allah mencintai orang yang bertakwa orang yang kaya dan orang yang tidak pamer

8934259 bukanlah orang yang kaya itu dengan banyaknya harta namun orang kaya itu adalah kaya jiwa hati

8934269 i respect the right of anyone not to publish the orbital elements for their satellites

8934283 it is fantastic to see these families having fun and staying connected over the summer in a relaxed setting
8934284 ensure that children in our community receive a quality early childhood experience
8934285 it is important to keep programming through the summer for continuity
8934286 if a little one has been coming to groups or to a program all year and then we take a two to three month break it is hard to get into the routine again even if we see a family or child one or two times in the summer it helps us avoid the stranger anxiety common with this developmental stage

8934299 but thanks be to god who made us his captives and leads us along in christs triumphal procession now wherever we go he uses us to tell others about the lord and to spread the good news like a sweet perfume our lives are a fragrance presented by christ to god but this fragrance is perceived differently by those being saved and by those perishing to those who are perishing we are a fearful smell of death and doom but to those who are being saved we are a life giving perfume
8934300 as the deer pants for streams of water so i long for you o god
8934301 just as the rich rule the poor so the borrower is servant to the lender
8934302 we are supposed to take drastic action against whosoever indulges in violence
8934303 it is not just that the american side could not restrain the georgian leadership from this criminal act the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
8934304 why spend years holding difficult negotiations and looking for complicated compromises in ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one of the parties and push it to kill the other party and the job is done the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
8934305 lets hope we do not see any direct confrontation in that
8934306 the economic structure has been optimised the governments working efficiency had been raised and peoples living standards have improved

8934320 in the realm of hungry ghosts close encounters with addiction
8934321 because of the fuel prices they are doing everything with their horses
8934322 i have been around them all my life ever since i was big enough to walk they were all my dad farmed with they were all he had
8934323 the expenses of running a farm are quite high with the fertilizer and the feed and everything else we just couldnt afford the diesel prices we have to try to cut back as much as possible
8934324 we have been on rides with them weve done weddings weve been in parades with them we just enjoy them
8934325 even if diesel prices go back down in the future hell keep working the horses its his passion hes one with the horses
8934326 it is paradise to us before this we had just one acre on brickyard road so this has been a dream for both of us
8934327 its a healthy way of life youre outside i love the outdoors and youre in tune with nature
8934328 with all of the high tech things today the world is changing so fast we still think this is where its at i wouldnt have it any other way
8934329 they prove that there are still people willing to go back to the hard work of it
8934330 its such a contrast with todays time when everyone is so busy and wrapped up that we dont know what would i do if it got to the point where i couldnt afford to drive the carpers know what to do theyve gone back to the earth
8934331 i dont know how much we save doing it this way but its a lot as high as diesel is and the horses give us our own natural fertilizer too
8934332 if something were to happen to this world a lot of people would have trouble surviving
8934333 i believe that the people who do work like we do and the amish they would survive
8934334 with the diesel and fertilizer prices i think theyre trying to drive small farms out of business but we keep plugging along it might get us one of these days but right now no

8934378 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama
8934379 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain sen
8934380 the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
8934381 from the temple grounds barack obama will outline an agenda for america that includes raising taxes increasing spending putting government bureaucrats in charge of health care and isolating america from the benefits of the global economy
8934382 while barack obama will talk about his plans to tax the rich and cut taxes on the middle class he will not say that his record includes voting for higher taxes 94 times and voting for a tax increase on those making just 42 000 per year
8934383 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
8934384 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
8934385 now many of these plans will cost money which is why ive laid out how ill pay for every dime by closing corporate loopholes and tax havens that dont help america grow but i will also go through the federal budget line by line eliminating programs that no longer work and making the ones we do need work better and cost less because we cannot meet 21st century challenges with a 20th century bureaucracy
8934386 i do not make a promise that we can reduce it by 2013 because i think it is important for us to make some critical investments right now in americas families
8934387 ill help our auto companies re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america ill make it easier for the american people to afford these new cars
8934388 and ill invest 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and 5 million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
8934389 we are very pleased with the courts ruling on this first to file patent challenge which once again continues to underscore our ability to effectively pursue and monetize paragraph iv opportunities

8934402 what gets people out of bed in the morning is a question i need to answer on a daily basis it varies from every individual
8934403 i knew i was going to carry more players this year and therefore the hardest part of the job is motivating those who are not 1 11 but 12 25 but thats my life
8934404 where dean windass is concerned he just wants to play football
8934405 he said to me he just wants to score goals and he has done that so he is ticking all the boxes

8934407 i think you can ask the question when the sun stops shining and the weather changes and the clever beautiful game tends to become more of a hard tackling hard working mentality
8934408 with the sun on his back he is a very good player when it is blowing a gale a little bit more blustery or a little bit more wet then ill answer the question
8934409 its nice going into the game with four points under our belts so that anxiety of getting a first win or of getting points away and at home is not there
8934410 the only anxiety we have is the strength of wigan as a unit i think they are a powerful team
8934411 i think they will be knocking at the door of the top end this season they are a top half premier league team if not with a good season maybe getting into the european places
8934412 they have built their squad and added to that and the strength in depth they have now is where we want to be in two or three years time

8934428 while it may be possible for an mlm to operate within the law when the rewards for participating individuals are based primarily on recruiting additional participants and not on selling the underlying product it is appropriate for governments at both the federal and state level to investigate and act where deception and abuse are occurring
8934429 asta is aware of a recent trade article in which a former asta official 16 years ago was quoted in support of a multi level travel marketing firm that has been sued by the state of california among others
8934430 card mills are a different type of operation in which the idea is to sell what purport to be travel agent credentials to consumers who are not planning to seriously engage in the sale of travel as a business but who are trying to secure professional courtesy discounts that are not intended for them asta has actively opposed card mills for decades we filed suit in california and the case was settled by our collecting and destroying the cards that had been issued we also complained to the federal trade commission but our request for a trade regulation rule was denied in large part due to lack of support from the supplier community

8934453 nashoba valley medical center is pleased to sponsor dr pincuss workshop in cooperation with the ayer education foundation
8934454 her experience in working with children who have anxiety disorders should prove a positive resource for parents in the nashoba valley region
8934455 this is another positive example of all segments of the community working together to help students develop the skills necessary to become healthy productive adults
8934456 this program will help give parents skills and strategies to better deal with anxiety in our children and this will help our students to gain more from the educational experience
8934457 i encourage parents to attend dr pincuss lecture particularly if they suspect their child may have anxiety recent research indicates that family involvement can be very important for children with some types of anxiety disorders
8934458 i would also encourage teachers to attend the lecture as it is likely that they will encounter children with anxiety in their classes
8934459 pumping water long distances is also incredibly energy intensive youve got to look at the options available for each city and assess them on a range of parameters
8934460 its kind of hard to be out there and try to be someone there for people to talk to when theres a lot of homophobia around
8934461 the holmes county school district shall provide a safe nurturing environment and a comprehensive curriculum that will allow students to achieve their highest potential and become responsible productive citizens
8934462 i was upset by what the kids at school were going through and i felt wronged that the school board said i couldnt wear a shirt supporting the glbt students
8934463 probably had an opportunity as the courts have pointed out in the learning environment of schools where not just comfortable issues are to be learned or debated that this would have been an opportunity for leadership it would have been an opportunity for understanding and an opportunity for civil discourse and a learning opportunity about tolerance and diversity

8934469 at the present time there is insufficient evidence to institute proceedings against dr haneef for any criminal offence
8934470 even though its 8 million of taxpayers money and 14 months late
8934471 ive spoken to dr haneef and hes very happy and thankful that this has finally emerged
8934472 the continued claims by mick keelty that dr haneef was a person of interest has worsened the damage to dr haneefs reputation that the actions of july 2007 had already caused
8934473 mr keelty has spent millions of taxpayers dollars in further damaging dr haneefs name
8934474 must surely call into question mr keeltys tenure in his present position

8934502 it is unconscionable to think that a considered review of childrens television standards would not include protecting children from the influence of junk food advertising
8934503 i think many people will be shocked to find out that acma intends to continue to allow junk food companies to focus their advertising efforts on vulnerable children and young people
8934504 it is absurd for acma to allege that advertising junk food to children does not influence their desire for and consumption of these foods

8934512 in order to respond appropriately to the rapidly rising food prices and the threats posed by climate changes and for us to boost agriculture it is important that african countries commit themselves to fast tracking the au nepad comprehensive africa agriculture development programme
8934513 the purpose of our engagements with the parliamentarians from various countries including those at the pan african parliament the african parliamentarians union and the east african legislative assembly eala is to brief them about the nepad caadp process in agriculture
8934514 more pertinently the aim is to appeal to them to monitor and align their national agricultural policies towards the fast tracking and implementation of caadp which includes raising budgetary allocations for agriculture to 10 percent and to raise agricultural productivity by 6 percent per annum
8934515 that can help us to deal with the overriding environmental threats towards african livelihoods and welfare
8934516 discussion will focus on a draft framework for parliamentary action on caadp which was initiated during an agricultural expert working group in cape town south africa in march 2007
8934517 4 5 million customer account details including names addresses dates of birth and social security numbers had been compromised after two sets of tape backups went missing from a third party courier

8934519 it is simply outrageous that this mountain of information was not better protected and it is equally outrageous that we are hearing about a possible six million additional individuals and businesses six months after the fact we fear a substantial number connecticut residents are among this latest group
8934520 nothing in the data we were given in may and june by bny mellon indicated in any way that these additional six million individuals and businesses were involved this certainly raises serious additional questions about how secure personal identifying data is at the bank of new york mellon and widens the scope of our investigation

8934615 broken politics in washington and the failed policies of george w bush
8934616 john mccain has voted with president bush 90 percent of the time

8934618 obama took sky high expectations and brought them down to ground level with a tremendous political speech that tried to connect with the concerns of average american voters
8934619 he managed to mix boiler plate policy proposals with american stories and values into a road map for the fall campaign it will take a few days before we know whether voters think obama hit a home run here in denver tonight but by any measure it was a big success
8934620 he made the argument that he is qualified to be commander in chief which is one of the criticisms that has been made against him because of his judgment not his experience and again he questioned john mccains judgment but if this speech is successful for him it will be because he got through to people who are worried about their kids education who are worried about whether theyre going to have health care and he talked a lot about that
8934621 for over two decades hes subscribed to that old discredited republican philosophy give more and more to those with the most and hope that prosperity trickles down to everyone else

8934630 there were tremendous fear from conservative and liberal supporters of the march that there might be violence
8934631 he was he brought his a game and god put his a spirit in him that day and he spoke to the world
8934632 barack obama is a certain part of the dream when he announced for president i had already signed on for hillarys campaign
8934633 i knew hillary from the white house and i kept saying to myself and to other people that my head is with hillary but my heart is with obama
8934634 forty five years ago we had a candidate it was freedom now they have a real live breathing candidate its barack obama forty five years ago we were them and 45 years later they are us

8934923 i think one of the biggest things we need to address is our leadership
8934924 we are coming off a highly successful season last year with a tremendous leadership group we have lost over half of our starting lineup we are looking for our seniors to be strong leaders but we are a relatively young team so we are looking for everyone to step up and be a leader in some shape or form
8934925 i think we have more depth higher level of skill and more athleticism on the forward line
8934926 i think we have one of the strongest midfield lines with all three starters returning
8934927 they have a great understanding of how they play and integrate within the midfield it is also a very flexible in that we can have a rotating midfield
8934928 the biggest challenge is going to be finding the right combination in the backfield
8934929 the outletting piece is one of the most important pieces and at the moment i know we have two players that will be in the fold bourazeris and tait but after that we have about five players that an opportunity to earn those other two spots

8934965 it will also benefit the physical education department the schools ive talked with have said switching to turf has had a positive impact on athletics but more importantly physical education
8934966 we wanted to make that field a place where kids could learn in physical education and play on from our athletic and community teams from three in the afternoon right through to the weekend
8934967 we wanted to do it in a way that was safe and cost effective we also felt doing the turf was the way to maximize safety
8934968 when weather gets bad on the field when it was grass it gets really sloppy
8934969 in the old days we played in mud and slop but not anymore the kids too are really enthused about this whole situation

8935179 we plan to sit in a bar and watch the whole thing
8935180 when you say wind solar and tide most every expert that i know says that
8935181 when someone writes a book its like where did you get the inspiration from but when someone writes a song people think that it actually happened
8935182 there are truths that i know about my motivations that i guess no one else knows and will ever know
8935183 ive definitely been aware of what i wanted people to think i was and i was always able to step outside of that and know who i was really
8935184 i think people are finally starting to say why do i want to hear about this
8935185 weve probably had too much realism and were going to swing back for a few years
8935186 there was a big danger that it got too surreal
8935187 i had a story that i was trying to put across but it would be a story about a donkey or an alien i definitely learned to peg it back a bit
8935188 i feel like we quite possibly mean nothing but weve got this ability to appreciate ourselves and each other were only here for a nano second well probably be extinct and well never know why but dont you feel great to be alive
8935189 the reason its son is literally because nephew is two syllables and son is one
8935190 you dont really listen to songs as much as the words of a novel or dialogue in a film so if you complicate anything more than the basics you dont get the story ive tried to write songs in the third person and all sorts of perspectives but all my songs end up being about me
8935191 when i say paparazzi top of the pops heat magazine celebrity culture you have totally different associations than if i go beer and fruit machines but theyre just words i came up with to put the story across and often the stories are the same
8935192 you can look at a film made in montreal about fishermen in the great lakes and thats you in that boat trying to catch those fish the only thing that were ever doing is telling ourselves a story the ability to think into the future consider the past handle the present is everything were doing all the time
8935193 i realised shortly afterwards that people dont want to know that shit
8935194 subconsciously were all fully aware of how evil we can be which is why we dont need songs on the radio reminding us of that i was seeking some kind of truth with that album and i got to the point where i realised that we dont want the truth we want to be redirected for 10 000 years of civilisation weve been trying to get away from the fact that were fucking monkeys
8935195 um no i think i was just being a monkey thinking that were sophisticated and we can talk about these things doesnt mean we dont do all the stupid stuff
8935196 yeah i do but i cant really and its not because it upsets me its because im not far enough from it to know really but the further away i get from it the more thats a big part of it i think the insecurities i felt were intensified by everything that was happening
8935197 i guess i have the ability to do something really bad and i cant stop myself doing it but then i can look back and understand why i did it a lot of my songs are about i did it i couldnt stop doing it but i know exactly why and i guess thats different for a lot of people
8935198 well thats what this albums about its a parable its about starting where you are and walking to where you think you want to be
8935199 all ive been thinking about for the last two years is water beaches and trees im just fucking sick of it you know
8935200 from that word the streets and all that i feel that the streets should be
8935201 uphold the full social and political equality of all its citizens without distinction of religion race or sex to guarantee freedom of religion conscience education and culture will safeguard the holy places of all religions and will loyally uphold the principles of the united nations charter

8935203 fled through a forest bullets winging overhead and reached lebanon where they stayed for more than a year living on meagre united nations hand outs
8935204 was that the refugee had exchanged his old address for a new one i had been a refugee in lebanon and now i was a refugee in my own country
8935205 i stood before a microphone for the first time in my life and read a poem which was an outcry from an arab boy to a jewish one
8935206 you can play in the sun as you please but i cant you have a house and i have none you have celebrations but i have none why cant we play together
8935207 if you go on writing such poetry ill stop your father working in the quarry

8935214 give birth to me again that i may know in which land i will die in which land i will come to life again
8935215 the old will die off and the young will forget
8935216 israel will create in the course of the next ten or twenty years conditions which would attract natural and voluntary migration of the refugees from the gaza
8935217 the palestinians are beasts walking on two legs eretz israel will be restored to the people of israel all of it and for ever
8935218 would be crushed like grasshoppers heads smashed against the boulders and walls
8935219 palestinians are like crocodiles the more you give them meat they want more
8935220 everybody has to move run and grab as many palestinian hilltops as they can to enlarge the jewish settlements because everything we take now will stay everything we dont grab will go to them
8935221 when we have settled the land all the arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle
8935222 enjoys a unique relationship with the united nations despite its failure to comply with a host of un resolutions no action is ever taken
8935223 deplores the decision by the government of israel to resume the deportation of palestinian civilians
8935224 in contravention of its obligations under the fourth geneva convention deported on 17th december hundreds of palestinians
8935225 strongly condemns the action reaffirms the applicability of the fourth geneva convention to all the territories occupied by israel reaffirms also the independent sovereignty and territorial integrity of lebanon demands that israel as the occupying power ensure the safe and immediate return to the occupied territories of all those deported
8935226 israel hears the un resolution and then does what it does anyway
8935227 a shipment of food aid for the people of the gaza strip was denied entry by israeli military forces on monday the world health organization has estimated malnutrition rates among children in gaza may be as high as 45 due to the israeli imposed siege israeli politicians have openly declared that they plan to choke and starve gaza into giving up resistance to the israeli military occupation of their land
8935228 the united states britain france and other members walked out of a closed meeting of the un security council late wednesday after libya compared the situation in gaza to nazi concentration camps in world war ii
8935229 the suffering of the 1 4 million people in gaza two thirds of whom are refugees and thus classified as persons due special protection is beyond description and counting
8935230 you do not die because you are created or because you have a body you die because you are the face of the future
8935231 forget about any intimacy i just want to actually sit down and eat dinner with my wife at least once a week she is so involved in our sons activities sports and school events that i never see her we do go to his games together but were not really together because she is so focused on him im the invisible man she is out of the house every evening ferrying him and his friends to different activities and i never get to see her i want our son to be active and involved but i think he is taking advantage of his mother we are never alone together i miss having a relationship with my wife
8935232 he spends at least two hours every evening on the phone with his daughter if hes not on the phone then hes at some extracurricular thing she does i dont get to talk with him until its time for bed and then im too tired to do more than mumble good night to him its worse when she comes to visit then i never see him to be honest shes a sweet girl and i would like to spend more time with her i know she would like it too but when shes here he becomes super dad trying to do everything he can to make up for leaving her mother
8935233 we paid for all her college and post grad expenses now she says she wants to take a new direction in life and go back for her doctorate and she expects us to pay for it that would mean dipping into our retirement fund and that is something we absolutely cannot do nor will either one of us pay for it from our salaries were making good money yes but we would like to enjoy our lives too we told her shed have to take out a loan and she was so startled at that statement that she hasnt spoken to us in over a month im sorry but we have to think about ourselves

8935293 you used to be fun you now act like a fascist
8935294 i think someone oughta take ericas comments from all the blogs she visits and mash em together into a new blog
8935295 erica you possess formidable talent i am impressed yet slightly repulsed
8935296 i find myself wandering the blogosphere to read ericas comments almost as much as to read everyones posts really
8935297 oh my gawd what a cutie she is bright eyed and full of wonder i could just listen to that accent all day
8935298 oh erica it is always good to know that brooklyn is in the house
8935299 i like you just the way you are a dooshbag
8935300 girl you are slicker than cow patties on wet dew in the morning and you can play half rubber better than anyone
8935301 one of the sweetest most intelligent and perceptive ladies i have never met
8935302 erica has cornered the market on crap blogging in a highly disgusting but yet entertaining way
8935303 i can have a mason jar of grade a pure d buck goat pee especially delivered to the troll of your choice at any given time
8935304 erica has a heart two sizes too big for her may god bless her and keep her
8935305 omg i so totally rate right now erica has left anti nj words in the comments here on my blog
8935306 beating erica sherman at pool was a rare treat and i think perhaps people should know even at the expense of possibly coming off as a braggart for going on and on about beating this aforementioned individual at her own game
8935307 china julia child and yiddish how do these things go together why in a post by erica of course need you ask lol
8935308 i dont do memes and i dont do links i do do gratuitous sex you know my email
8935309 as you gaze into the mullet remember that the mullet also gazes into you
8935310 in formula 1 you have to give someone half a year of time before you start to judge him
8935311 the half year is over and he is now in a situation where he has to prove his talents
8935312 i would not say that i already have a clear opinion on him but i also have to say that sebastian vettel started a couple of races before and he performed very well in the first half year
8935313 so we will have to see how the second half goes for sebastien bourdais
8935314 and honestly i dont want to be drawn into an expression of opinion at this very moment
8935315 the first direction that we look in is obviously to the red bull young driver programme and then well see
8935316 but we are not quite ready yet we dont really have a list in our heads at this stage
8935317 we are far from saying its this one or that one because we are also waiting to see if something happens elsewhere and probably then well get a new chance
8935318 sebastian has helped us a lot to get the right atmosphere back
8935319 we had been really struggling with scott speed and tonio liuzzi last year but he has proved what the team is able to do and has done it in a very nice way with us with the engineers with everybody
8935320 that has pushed us such an immense step forward it is really a pity to lose him
8935321 from a human and physical perspective these two races are pivotal to our title challenge
8935322 its vital that every member of the team pulls together to make sure these races pass without undue incident and set us up nicely for the final flyaway races
8935323 the reality is that we have tremendous faith in our colleagues at mercedes benz and feel comfortable with both our engines performance and reliability
8935324 the recent engine failures suffered by ferrari in hungary and valencia clearly demonstrate that even a homologated engine can break so we take nothing for granted
8935325 theres always an element of risk whenever you come to two fast and demanding circuits but we have the additional security of knowing both our drivers can each still suffer an engine failure without receiving a 10 place grid penalty
8935326 weve got a number of smaller aero developments in the pipeline theres nothing on the car that will be visually very startling but theres plenty of detail work
8935327 were also focusing on further mistake proofing our systems the championship is going to be a hard fought slog until the end of the year and we need to leave no stone unturned in our quest for additional performance and improved reliability
8935328 i prefer the more historic circuits like monza silverstone and monaco
8935329 you really feel the history of those places whenever you race there they have real character
8935330 each time they are refurbished they lose a little more of their individuality but they are made safer so we can continue to race on them so thats a good compromise
8935331 even before i first came here which was back in 2002 for a formula renault race i played it on my computer it was always one of the best tracks
8935332 it has probably the most exciting corner in formula 1 eau rouge and its one of the few circuits where you really feel like youre actually going somewhere you blast off into the forest and get to the top of the hill and can feel the whole circuit beneath you
8935333 the significant volume of activity in both the development and investment portfolios experienced last year has continued into the first four months of 2008 a substantial emphasis has been placed on asset management and growing the value of the investment portfolio along with preparing development properties for their optimum use by maximizing development potential
8935334 the directors are satisfied that against an increasingly harsh economic environment in both ireland and the uk performance across the portfolio has been positive

8935349 weve listened to feedback from our customers who asked that we provide a specific threshold for data usage and this would help them understand the amount of usage that would qualify as excessive
8935350 we know from experience the vast majority of customers we ask to curb usage do so voluntarily
8935351 yeah sure echo youre really going out to seattle to get her back you dont have the cojones
8935352 we have a 70 pound dog and he didnt look like more than half of him so we did have some suspicions
8935353 we took him to the vet this friday and he was 22 8 pounds
8935354 we could have kept the cat here and profited from all those endeavors

8935356 c j s decision has absolutely no impact on xaviers decision he is still going to visit kansas during their ring ceremony and during late night that hasnt changed at all xavier is also going to visit memphis as far as a decision goes he hasnt made one xavier is going to do what is best for him
8935357 we arent getting caught up in the semantics of it being an official or unofficial visit
8935358 obviously north carolina state is ten minutes away and john has already spent significant time on kentuckys and oklahoma states campuses
8935359 baylors situation in hiring dwon gives john a comfort level that doesnt exist anywhere else
8935360 but there are some schools that john is interested in because of style of play or the incoming recruiting class those factors and others might have as much to do with where john goes to school as anything
8935361 john doesnt owe anyone anything if he wants to go to baylor or if he wants to go to memphis he is going to do what he thinks is best for himself dwon did what was best for himself and that does have some impact on john because his comfort level is the most important factor but it doesnt obligate john to go to baylor

8935365 nothing is going to stop us from forming a new government
8935366 we need to move forward we need to make sure that zimbabwe regains its status we need to work on the economy
8935367 although we dont want to comment on the talks we dont know where they are getting it that mugabe can appoint cabinet from
8935368 mugabe will have a difficult time running governing without a majority but that is not his real problem his main problem really is the crumbling economy the day to day running of government does not need the control of parliament so he can manoeuvre
8935369 however there is no room for manoeuvre in dealing with the economic crisis
8935370 a passer by might have mistaken it for a lost father son reunion
8935371 initially there was tension between us but as we chatted about this and that and became more relaxed i discovered that he was a human being after all
8935372 we chatted about family about my mother as well as about politics and the talks mugabe ate a lot and knew exactly what he wanted he is very alert mentally but physically the age is telling
8935373 i got the impression that he has a deep commitment to his legacy i realised that he actually believes a lot of what he is saying its not all said just for propaganda purposes he is paranoid about the british i think overall he wants to prove to them that he is right
8935374 i said why dont you talk to them and he said well you know blair was bad enough but this brown he is even worse
8935375 at one point mugabe told me you know some people say im a murderer but im not let the two of us carry on eating together and showing that we can go forward in peace
8935376 it felt like a remarkably normal conversation most of the time apart from his denial of the violence in zimbabwe
8935377 he seemed to be unaware or he feigned ignorance of the atrocities committed by his own people
8935378 i wondered if he was suppressing knowledge of something he was not comfortable with right up to the end of the dinner i kept coming back to the issue of violence and he kept denying any knowledge of it
8935379 i left the hotel wondering why mugabe is so violent why does he resort to violence whenever he is cornered being in his company i couldnt imagine where the violent streak was i think he suppresses it even to himself or is it the people around him he doesnt seem as bad when youre with him but i know he was trying to manipulate me that night
8935380 the young adult traveled to yellowstone national park bridger teton national forest and other sites within teton county
8935381 he was involved in a combination of activities during his visit that included working on a service project camping sightseeing and participating in sports
8935382 at this time the exact location where the exposure to the disease occurred is not known and it is likely we will never determine that level of detail
8935383 the principal of an islamic boarding school on buffalos east side has been forced to resign after allegations that he was sexually involved with one of his students and that he claimed to have taken her as a second wife
8935384 i want families to know these people are not following islamic laws they are not following american laws they claim they are serving islam but they are just serving themselves
8935385 in our culture we dont even let girls sit with their male cousins and this guy is a teacher why is this man who has said we are not even allowed to chat with a boy doing this
8935386 at the same time im thinking he is a teacher he is very famous maybe he knows something i dont know

8935389 when i talked to the former student we realized it was almost the same story for both of us
8935390 as far as marriage and divorce that has never been there not even islamically not even from the religious point of view
8935391 the vast majority of passengers affected by the suspension of the airlines services should be able to secure alternative flights and will be entitled to refunds
8935392 in accordance with advice issued today by the civil aviation authority customers who paid by debit or charge card are advised to contact their card companies to ascertain whether they are entitled to a full or partial refund
8935393 we are trying to make as many passengers as possible aware of their options in terms of alternative flights and the possibility of securing refunds for the flights they booked with zoom
8935394 we have been in contact with other airlines including ba british airways virgin and flyglobespan in particular and they have made clear the availability of alternative flights
8935395 we would like to reassure people that yesterday every possible effort was made to save the airline and safeguard flights and it was only very late in the day when the actions of suppliers and creditors made it impossible to continue

8935397 an incomplete story referencing apple inc was inadvertently published by bloomberg news at 4 27 p m new york time today
8935398 the item was never meant for publication and has been retracted

8935403 the mv concept for this was set as park jung ah missing kim dong wan hurt ga in remembrance tae yeon sadness sun ye promise etc with different feelings for each scene setting they all did a marvellous job for the crying scenes and the four girls were so emotional that they couldnt stop crying even after the cameras had stopped rolling
8935404 so where does this leave midnight sun my first feeling was that there was no way to continue writing isnt like math in math two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like with writing the way you feel changes everything if i tried to write midnight sun now in my current frame of mind james would probably win and all the cullens would die which wouldnt dovetail too well with the original story in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely
8935405 im just never going to finish it because i want to kill all the cullens now blah blah blah

8935407 for example it would allow people entering the house to type in a four digit pin code on a pad by the door
8935408 if there was an adult in the house the children would be able to use the oven or microwave but they couldnt if they were home alone similarly it is a way to control or block content on the tv
8935409 we dont believe that we have set the ultimate standard here
8935410 but we believe we have moved the debate ahead by demonstrating that network control systems dont have to be too complicated it is simple for anyone who can use tv text to set up a device and an administrator after connecting a device can decide that it should only be visible or controllable by certain people
8935411 we demonstrated that devices could be automatically recognised by the network to move forward requires the manufacturers of home network enabled devices to agree on a number of standards
8935412 this shows we are on the right track with our ever stronger international presence and above all our product program
8935413 we will systematically push ahead with our growth course even in the present difficult market environment
8935414 i think his proposals to improve the country are more positive and im not a big war believer

8935422 by any yardstick it was another rough quarter for bank earnings
8935423 as the industry coped with financial market disruptions the housing slump worsening economic conditions and the overall downturn in the credit cycle
8935424 were not just going to see mid sized banks go under in the next few months were going to see a whopper were going to see a big one one of the big investment banks or big banks
8935425 were just finishing the merger of the aef center with afpc and i think thats going to pay dividends for all of our deployed airmen
8935426 what we had before the merger was two different organizations taking actions in stovepipes the aef center may have been working a deployment and afpc may have been working an assignment and the individual got hit with both of them now by having the two together we can incorporate the aef cycle into day to day personnel actions
8935427 for instance the nco retraining program release will be vetted through the aef cycle in the future to ensure airmen arent in retraining during their assigned aef rotation
8935428 we had an individual who because of a series of reclama actions received one weeks notice to go to three months of training before a deployment
8935429 our old metrics showed 90 days notice because he didnt have to be in the u s central command area of responsibility until 90 days later when in fact he had one weeks notice to get to training
8935430 if we have one short notice tasking thats one too many were passionate about meeting our goal of reducing short notice taskings to zero
8935431 but we want to make sure our processes in working these taskings isnt responsible for the delay in notification
8935432 anytime that you put something on the web it obviously helps deployed airmen because they can then get access to their records at any time
8935433 were trying to give individuals control of their personnel business just like many banking companies are giving us control over our finances you can go online and check out your bank account you can access it any day and at any hour of the day thats what were doing with the personnel services one of our goals is to give airmen more control of their personnel actions
8935434 the afcc is open 24 7 so you can call and ask questions
8935435 if they cant answer it they will get you to the subject matter experts who can
8935436 with the web based system airmen dont have to wonder if the commander will come around
8935437 everyone knows at the same time whether theyve been selected for promotion and commanders still congratulate their people
8935438 you put the programs out there and you think youve got them worked and that they make sense and then your customers start using them and say that it doesnt work or it doesnt make sense
8935439 so were always soliciting feedback and thats one of the reasons im on this trip
8935440 weve got a great a1 staff in the aor led by lt col paul valenzuela and a great afcent a1 staff at shaw afb s c led by col ron barnes
8935441 we are all joined together as a team to work the issues our goal is always to let the home team work it and if they cant they know to push it up to afpc were all committed to making all personnel processes better
8935442 a lot of people are saying complimentary things so now lets move it to the next level no one out there is saying that the systems egregiously broken i think there are some out there who feel it can be better but i think on the whole our customers are saying its working now lets make some refinements ive been pleased about that and im learning about opportunities to refine how we get the right people in the right place with the right skills at the right time
8935443 kaukonde was seen as behind the mujuru faction and mugabe was bitter
8935444 he decided to replace him with chigwedere whose loyalty to mugabe is unquestionable
8935445 there are more people who will be dumped from the current cabinet and from party structures
8935446 the plan now is to have a restructuring exercise that will ensure that people who are deemed failures will not be elected as leaders ahead of the partys conference in bindura in december
8935447 gdp growth is projected to slow down to the range of 7 7 5 per cent in the next three quarters moodys said in a statement after growing at over 9 per cent for over two years economic growth has declined mainly due to hardening of interest rates and spurt in oil and commodity prices
8935448 mr peters has offered to step aside obviously ive accepted that offer and i in the meantime assume the portfolios he holds clark told reporters in auckland
8935449 it is to be hoped that the sfo will address there matters expeditiously
8935450 i want to assure you it will never happen again in this country you have my commitment and my promise
8935451 we also have to be concerned about future generations of americans

8935456 well they ought to do this they ought to do that
8935457 due to the dramatic increase in huntsmans net debt and decrease in its earnings since last july their proposal does not come close to making the combined company solvent
8935458 huntsmans shareholders lack this information because huntsman has despite our repeated requests for more than two months refused to permit its shareholders to review our delaware complaint and the duff amp phelps solvency analysis if this information were made public huntsman shareholders would understand that this proposal is inadequate we are not seeking to renegotiate this transaction
8935459 set of cognitive abilities that control and regulate other abilities and behaviors
8935460 include the ability to initiate and stop actions to monitor and change behavior as needed and to plan future behavior when faced with novel tasks and situations
8935461 executive functions allow us to anticipate outcomes and adapt to changing situations
8935462 why the ability to resist distraction may be more important to academic success than traditional measures of intelligence
8935463 most people can recall a kid from grade school who couldnt stay seated who talked out of turn and fidgeted constantly whose backpack overflowed with crumpled handouts and who always had to ask other kids what the homework assignment was
8935464 not surprisingly they were almost always lousy students as well this kind of student has been tagged with a variety of labels over the years antisocial personality conduct disorder stupid
8935465 that a childs ability to inhibit distracting thoughts and stay focused may be a fundamental cognitive skill one that plays a big part in academic success from preschool on indeed this and closely related skills may be more important than traditional iq in predicting a childs school performance
8935466 we can pump up these ef skills with regular exercise just as we do with muscles
8935467 dramatic role playing is a cornerstone of the ef philosophy the writer provides the following summary of a group of students working on the development of their executive function skills
8935468 the preschoolers all four and five years old actually design the plays action by themselves
8935469 lets pretend youre the mommy and im the baby ill get sick and youll need to take me to the doctor
8935470 the idea is that play of this kind promotes the internalization of rules and expectations and demands mental discipline to stay in character all cognitive challenges importantly these exercises are not tacked on as a separate teaching but rather are integrated into every activity of the childs day from reading to math
8935471 executive skills are disproportionately worse in children from deprived economic circumstances and these skills may account for up to half of the gap in school readiness between white kids and african american kids
8935472 the official chinese position if it were pushed would be that this is unacceptable
8935473 china doesnt want to give the green light to somebody coming to the side of separatist forces within their troubled regions
8935474 china will not abstain china is not going to go for something overturning a sovereign government and a sovereign rule
8935475 its just not going to happen as chinas position on taiwan would go down the drain
8935476 if the resolution is focused on the question of sovereignty china may very well side with the west
8935477 but china will do its upmost to avoid such a resolution being presented to the because it doesnt want to damage its relationship with russia
8935478 it is always possible that the western countries will force a vote and if it happens i think china will abstain
8935479 thats not in chinas interest as it has in the past managed to get some influence in central asia and china and russia both cooperate and compete in the region for influence
8935480 it is naturally very frustrating for her to miss tournaments

8935483 takla is scheduled to arrive this weekend and will work with sania for a period of six weeks
8935484 the goal is to ensure her wrist recovers to its original strength but at the same time the focus will also be towards optimising her overall physical fitness
8935485 it is difficult to fix a timeframe for being back in competition even before work towards her rehabilitation has begun
8935486 but we are looking at sania playing a few tournaments later in the year to prepare for next years
8935487 when one is forced to skip grand slams and other compulsory tournaments one has to expect that the ranking will come down because these are based on performances in these tournaments

8935498 fear of legal problems is one of the main reasons why smes are slow to launch internet based services from e commerce to online marketing
8935499 it is vital for smes to know what regulations apply to which country to respect them and then to adjust their cash flow to reflect their obligations
8935500 web 2 0 refers to the sharing collaboration and interactivity typical in many of the most successful online services that have launched in recent years
8935501 we didnt use the wikipedia software which is also open source because any users can post information
8935502 we check contributors manually using our panel of experts around europe to establish that the contributor has a sufficient level of expertise to write an article on internet law
8935503 most of the contributors come from universities or law firms who want to raise their profile
8935504 the choice of contributors was deliberate because were hoping to keep the service as low cost as possible so it will remain sustainable
8935505 we are building a critical mass of users and contributors around the world and we hope the service will continue to track the rapid change in online law
8935506 like police in other countries we never use any kind of tools to beat unarmed people
8935507 i was there and i saw them using stun guns to give electrical shocks to our church members

8935513 he has always been the one thats coming the next great football player at reynolds high school and he was
8935514 they live in this beautiful house and he had this piece of paper taped on his door with his football goals and
8935515 he had a sign over his door that said football is my life
8935516 there is no denying that overall the cross strait ties have been warming as seen in the launching of the first
8935517 indicates that the two sides indeed have a huge gap on the issue we should step up communication over it
8935518 as everyone knows the un and its specialised agencies are organisations made up of the governments of sovereign nations
8935519 there is only one china in the world and taiwan is part of china
8935520 thirteen hundred kids across the nation are either killed or have serious injuries by being shaken every year
8935521 but anecdotally weve seen an increase in shaken baby cases
8935522 shaken baby syndrome is probably the one thing that is 100 percent preventable
8935523 we have been working really hard for the last many years the last 10 years stop shaking your baby
8935524 some people interpret that it is the baby being bad babies cant be bad they are trying to communicate something to us sparks said
8935525 so people who are perpetrators of shaken baby syndrome are not necessarily mean people they are not bad people they are not monsters they are people who have a limited ability to control their impulses they dont deal with frustration well and they dont know much about babies
8935526 the reason these solutions are having to come from the bottom up is because we have a failure in washington
8935527 our solutions arent going to all come from washington we as a community have to start addressing them as your congressman i can help drive that dialogue
8935528 its not what happens on september 9th and november 4th its what we do with it in january other candidates want to be a congressman im running to be your representative

8935548 this is just a fraction of all employees there are about 100 people in administration and over 300 people of flying staff the majority of the employees will stay within lot group
8935549 this is an exciting project for us we aim to tag in excess of 5 000 crabs in the first year alone and it will be very interesting to see where they turn up
8935550 we are learning a lot from the fishermen involved with the sisp project and their contributions are extremely valued the success of the project is dependent on getting good tag return information and as many tag returns as possible
8935551 the fishing industry will play the major role here and it is very important that they are aware of our project

8935556 the food and drink industry is a vital part of the economy and life of the highlands and islands the area is a major player in this industry and is home to a very significant proportion of scotlands iconic and quality produce
8935557 it is untenable that the next stages of the national food and drink policy can be properly formulated without the experience and expertise from this vital part of the countrys industry
8935558 it is particularly offensive that the scottish government does not seem to have recognised that the leaders of the highlands and islands food industry have the experience and expertise which would benefit of the whole of scotland

8935564 career journal recruiters fail to check past of some hires
8935565 i was 17 and in summer school because i needed to take an english class in order to enroll
8935566 it happened to be in the fine arts building and they made the mistake of leaving me alone in the recital hall i fell in love with the sound of the instrument and that thrill has never left me
8935567 wynton kept mentioning this cat thelonious monk and we thought thats a hell of a name
8935568 from that day on i was in those practice rooms every day
8935569 i never did practice scales i was trying to play what i heard and finding new things along the way inevitably if you come at music from that process you eventually start to settle into forms
8935570 i began to think of the instrument as 88 timbred drums and then i understood
8935571 you can have your sound and be off on an island somewhere
8935572 ive always tried to be aware of the standard theres no excuse not to learn everything there is to learn about composition
8935573 weve seen call growth from 30 000 to 60 000 in the last year
8935574 forty percent of those calls have been about food thats the first sign of a problem
8935575 we felt we needed to take a hard look at our web site
8935576 technology is changing and we felt this is one way we can take advantage of that
8935577 we care what our citizens think and how they feel about their community so we need to hear from them and this is just one vehicle to make sure that happens
8935578 were a fairly fast growing community in the area here and we felt that our web site should match that growth
8935579 and we feel were a fairly sophisticated community here and weve got a lot of things going on and we felt that we needed to be able to communicate one to our citizens and two to people visiting or wanting to do business here or maybe even considering relocating here
8935580 azeem o shaan shahenshah just like that jodhaa akbar song promo
8935581 the workers and the executives were afraid and worried and our foremost priority was to ensure their safety hence the management decided to evacuate its manpower from the plant late last evening
8935582 since the employees and contract labourers had left the plant late last night it was a conscious decision of the company that there would be no attendance at the project site at any of the three shifts today
8935583 when it comes to the future there are three kinds of people those who let it happen those who make it happen and those who wonder what happened
8935584 well your honor there are days when i see a cute guy walk past but im just not that hungry
8935585 i dunno clara it was the darndest thing first ole bob was runnin at me with that axe like he was all set to murder me and feed the pieces to the dogs whacked me right here but then he kinda pulled back and looked all tuckered out like tells me he just aint in the mood no more dont know what came over him he must be one of them borderliners we been hearin so much about in the news of late
8935586 it was my stamping ground while i was at school i made visits to the villa alongside geology field trips to whitecliff bay and redcliff it was the first roman villa i ever saw it was very inspiring
8935587 it is a privilege to return and be able to work on a major site like this i was curious to know what it looked like underneath the plan of the site didnt really make sense to me so now i can find out
8935588 victorian archaeologists did a good job on it by the standards of the day but they didnt really understand its structure and how it was used this is an important building and this type was not known then
8935589 they were interested in excavating its floors rather than getting a more complete site history
8935590 what we really want to do is to try to work out how the estate developed but there will be things i wont expect which is the beauty of archaeology you just never know what is going to jump out of the ground at you
8935591 brading roman villa is fairly typical of the best but with exceptional characteristics brading has remarkably well preserved mosaics which make it stand out at the moment its the most written about villa in roman britain its meaning is good material for debate
8935592 what wed expect but dont have evidence of is how the estate worked where the farmyards were where the workers lived and where the storage was among many other things
8935593 what we want to be able to do is feed our archaeology back to people by telling a good story of more than 600 years of occupation this is what people are really interested in to see visitors go around and enjoy what they are seeing is a thrill for archaeologists
8935594 often we work in fields by ourselves miles from anywhere and no ones seen what weve done but in brading you can feel youre doing something really useful for people rather than just pleasing your own academic interests
8935595 what id like to do whenever a phase of the project ends is publish a major academic volume when we think weve understood it properly we would re photograph the mosaics re plan the whole area with a totally new description and put in new archaeology to update it from the 1880s
8935596 funding is crucial weve had enormous support from the island community and huge support in kind so far but it costs to do a job like this we can get some money from archaeological trusts but many of them will only fund one or two years
8935597 woe is us if thou doest not refrain from burning dried horse dung to warm your homes polar bears will soon be spotted in the old kent road
8935598 you used to get a clip round the ear if you dared press the button now you end up in the middle of nowhere if you dont

8935605 the reality show that i am doing with my famiily is a great way to show that we are actually a normal family and not some freaks the tabloids make us out to be
8935606 no one in public service does it for the money
8935607 let me tell you what this is about we have to hold ourselves accountable this is the future of america if we dont solve this we will be a second rate nation by 2020
8935608 he made people comfortable and he recognized them which is the first time ive seen a superintendent do that
8935609 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
8935610 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
8935611 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
8935612 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
8935613 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
8935614 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
8935615 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume

8935621 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth
8935622 the cft shows that you have to train a whole lot more than just preparing for a three mile run and 20 pull ups
8935623 accordingly our high standards of professional and personal performance to include our physical fitness and military appearance must be maintained and adhered to by every marine
8935624 these are the things all marines should expect to do in combat
8935625 we are all going to be out there just like the grunts doing things they typically do
8935626 we wanted the events to directly reflect the input of our combat vets
8935627 for those who tested it from the 18 year old to the 60 yearold marine all of them think this is a great thing to do
8935628 its challenging but im confident that every marine will pass
8935629 tendencies toward increased weight have become a dangerous trend over the last decade in our american society
8935630 throughout our 232 year history the marine corps has fulfilled commitments to make marines and win our nations battles
8935631 our fellow americans recognize that long tradition and expect it to continue as a fighting force our ability to fulfill this commitment and accomplish the mission is dependent in part upon the fitness of our marines

8935641 the view that good ideas are rarer and more valuable that good people is rooted in a misconception of creativity
8935642 we as executives have to resist our natural tendency to avoid or minimize risks which of course is much easier said than done this instinct leads executives to choose to copy successes rather than try to create something brand new if you want to be original you have to accept the uncertainty even when it is uncomfortable and have the the capability to recover when your organization takes a big risk and fails whats the key to being able to recover talented people

8935649 when you think about the amount of information published to the web its a physical impossibility for the vast majority of that stuff to spread virally
8935650 its much more difficult to reach people today and much more expensive

8935674 we have to be open to these negotiations for the exchange of knowledge and experience between our professionals and the those from other countries

8935676 in the case of both biden and obamas family whats interesting is that the gentlemen in the family left in 1849 and then their families followed in 1850
8935677 what is even more peculiar is that both of the progenitors were shoemakers
8935678 why are people so flawed we all are in different degrees

8935680 its a japanese film that is also an american thriller
8935681 as an arab american woman i am of course aware that the title of my book is an ethnic slur
8935682 she also went on to say that when he book was released three years ago no one had a problem with the title well alicia because that would require actual umm
8935683 as a gay man i know how it feels to be called hateful names simply because of who i am therefore i felt it was important to retain the title of alicia erians novel in which she so effectively dramatizes the pain inflicted by such language something many people of non minority descent never have to face
8935684 if you have something to say to me say it to my face thats what i have believed my whole life dont be a coward and say it to others first let alone all the media in the world i think we know where the rest of this blog is going if you guessed it had to do with my father then you guessed right
8935685 it really hurts because i have tried after all that my mother and siblings have gone through i really tried to make things work for the hope of having a father again
8935686 he has no idea what is going on in my life because i have chosen not to involve him in it his recent attack on my life and my loved ones is simply for an addiction that he has fame why he feels the need to comment on anything in my life that i may want to keep private is beyond comprehension
8935687 if he really cared about me and my life then he would learn to respect my wishes by staying out of it samantha has and would never sell me out nor has my mother who is wonderful im not going to engage any further though i probably could go on i have said enough i have a therapist and it is not the cameraman at x17
8935688 i really dont want to say anything because i feel like he wins he being the man who is so desperate for attention that he goes to the media whenever possible i was angry when i first read his attack on me but i believe that actions speak louder than words so now i just pity him
8935689 i feel no need to publicly defend my role in lindsays life im just sorry that she likes me more than him p s im not the one that is so lost that i need to use my relationship with lindsay to earn a living
8935690 the response by samantha and lindsay regarding what i said is absolutely ridiculous when i first spoke to x17 i clearly started that everything i said and my concerns were generated by my ex wife dina i have taped recordings texts and the corroboration from lawyers and authorities to prove it
8935691 all i want is for lindsay to be healthy and in a good relationship i want her to use the gifts she has in the best ways and to help others i said it from the very beginning show me who you walk with and i will tell you who you are people may deceive us but our eyes and facts dont open your eyes

8935722 metal isnt all i listen to of course but there was a period of time where it was
8935723 i guess it started in school i started listening to stuff with screaming in it and then i started exploring more metal myspace helped me a lot and friends will tell me about certain bands and some of the bands i like arent necessarily

8935730 i wish i could just secretly do vocals and nobody would know its me
8935731 one time they were actually listening to metal and i was like what are you guys doing listening to metal
8935732 they took a lot of their stage ideas from metal bands from like europe and they use a lot of pyro and stuff like that but they like metal they dont listen to death metal but theyre definitely not opposed to it which i think is really cool it shows that theyre not just some pop band

8935761 in particolare spiega lesponente del pdl siamo contenti per il ritorno del voto in condotta nella valutazione complessiva degli studenti una battaglia che il centrodestra aveva gi vinto nella xiv legislatura con linserimento di questa misura nella riforma moratti su proposta di alleanza nazionale

8935777 they put their hands down my top in my shock and fear it felt like a hundred hands the guy in front of me the one with his hands in my clothes was the one i focused on and i kicked and yelled and hit him until they let go and then i ran home crying and screaming because i was walking home by myself i was carrying my house keys in my hand so the guy was repeatedly hit with my keys until he let go
8935778 i think if i were a woman i would prefer to be a pearl in the shell rather than a piece of cheap candy
8935779 let me tell you something i have been veiled for 2 years wearing very conservative clothes with the hijab and i was still constantly verbally harassed in the streets of cairo the veil doesnt protect its only a religious practice but it doesnt protect you if someone is sexually frustrated he will sexually harass you whether verbally or physically with or without the veil
8935780 our campaign is directed to a passive society and to each man who thinks that nobody would stop him if he harassed a woman on the street we want to tell the harasser to respect himself and that he will find a man to stand up to him on the street
8935781 they used to arrest the harasser and punish him by shaving his head but things are different now
8935782 i went to the police station a couple of days later with two egyptian friends both lawyers the police kept asking me to change my story they wanted me to remove any reference to actual breast groping because i was a foreigner and they were worried about an international incident they also repeatedly tried to make excuses for the men saying they must have been drunk or its just young guys having some fun they even asked me not to contact my embassy i did it anyway

8935787 cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
8935788 set a clear goal as president in 10 years we will finally end our dependence on oil from the middle east
8935789 same party that brought you two terms of george bush and dick cheney will ask this country for a third
8935790 if john mccain wants to have a debate about who has the temperament and judgment to serve as the next commander in chief
8935791 with the nomination of sen barack obama tonight the man who will lead the democratic party in its march toward the white house we are making a down payment on the fulfillment of that dream
8935792 not with so much work to be done not with so many children to educate and so many veterans to care for not with an economy to fix and cities to rebuild and farms to save not with so many families to protect and so many lives to mend america we cannot turn back we cannot walk alone at this moment in this election we must pledge once more to march into the future let us keep that promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess

8935805 we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country
8935806 down in the shadow of the penitentiary out by the gas fires of the refinery nowhere to run aint got nowhere to go
8935807 during my time in congress i have met many wonderful people who work for the federal government out of a sense of service to their country
8935808 unfortunately there is also a sizeable and growing number of federal employees who undermine the agencies they serve by failing to show up to work i believe the american taxpayer deserves better
8935809 this isnt about the federal workforce this is about the management of the federal workforce
8935810 promise of a land where all men are free and equal
8935811 there are those who say to you we are rushing this issue of civil rights i say we are 172 years late
8935812 the time has arrived for the democratic party to get out of the shadow of states rights and walk forthrightly into the bright sunshine of human rights
8935813 while its a dramatic and interesting choice it would make the argument hes making difficult to make
8935814 we wont go out there and rush to get someone in
8935815 if hes the right player for the club then well get him in

8935820 this fundraiser was a great example of how it is possible for the various organizations within the green industry to successfully pull together for a common cause this wasnt about personal or partisan politics it was about the need for the green industry to be on the radar screen of a centrist u s senator who will hold sway on many important votes for us in the years to come
8935821 at first we were looking at a 40 metric ton articulating dump truck as we looked over the site it became obvious we needed something smaller and more maneuverable like the hydrema 922c
8935822 mesco was right there during this process and helped us choose the best piece of equipment for the job
8935823 we are working on the side of a mountain with steep cliffs adding 8 feet of snow to the already challenging terrain creates an even more dangerous work environment
8935824 we had a few snow drifts that were 12 feet high which was a little scary we pushed the snow over the side of the mountain to get it out of our way quickly
8935825 we had mud up to the axles on the 922c but it always pulled through and never got stuck even when fully loaded it has very good traction in all kinds of conditions and is very powerful
8935826 the roads were 10 feet wide when we started the project and are now about 15 feet wide
8935827 we had to build turn around areas every 500 feet in order to haul the material safely off the mountain the hydrema 922c has excellent visibility and is small enough to maneuver in these confined work areas
8935828 weve loaded it with pipe and used it for hauling and unloading the sand and fill for backfilling the pipe trenches
8935829 we used the dirt from the excavation work on the water tank access road to create the new road this portion of the project required a lot of fill dirt to fill in the 20 foot deep slopes and gaps
8935830 we were able to knock this project out without compromising our water tank deadline due to the 922cs quick cycle time and maneuverability
8935831 ive been running the 922c for 50 hours a week and its held up very well with minimal downtime it is very easy to perform basic maintenance and extremely fuel efficient
8935832 abbiamo scelto il termine mercato piuttosto che negozio perch crediamo che gli sviluppatori debbano disporre di un ambiente aperto e libero per rendere i loro contenuti disponibili
8935833 im sorry weve had to increase our prices and weve made this decision extremely reluctantly especially as household budgets are being squeezed so much at the moment
8935834 there is help available for people who cant afford to pay their bills and we want our customers to get in touch if theyre worried
8935835 these are difficult times and we understand the financial impact this announcement will have on our customers
8935836 although were one of the last companies to announce increases were sorry we couldnt hold on any longer however we have worked very hard to protect people for as long as possible from these considerable increases in the wholesale market
8935837 we have tried hard to keep electricity prices as low as possible and our increase of 9 is the lowest in the sector

8935846 looking forwards guidance is for margins to continue falling and for arrears to continue rising earnings outlook is therefore very weak the margin issue is both the lack of ability to write new business currently available at higher margins at least in part due to funding constraints in our view
8935847 difficult to know just how long this bank can limp onwards and downwards given that the large uk banks have been nice enough to sub underwrite some of the 400m rights issue
8935848 none has shown an interest in wanting to buy the bank outright as far as we know despite the 82 per cent share price fall in the year to date
8935849 we have examined the risks to avevas organic growth stemming from asian shipyard exposure in light of recent commentary and conclude that the incremental investment levels remain robust planning assumptions continue to anticipate further capacity expansion and that avevas structural growth drivers retain strong upward momentum we upgrade our estimates and recommendation due to our confidence in end market momentum and in view of the powerful intrinsic operating leverage in the business
8935850 we expect this to be the first time that the tenanted pub company model is tested under a protracted downturn scenario lessees who are operationally highly leveraged are likely to seek more rent support from the tenanted pubcos pub companies for this reason we have removed the rpi retail price index linked rental growth from our 2009 and h1 first half 2010 estimates scenarios of 1 big declines in beer sales 7 10 per cent p a over 2009 10 and 2 significant numbers of tenants 20 per cent of pubco estates seeking rental support 20m 30m p a in excess of our estimates could see punch and enterprise breaching their debt covenants
8935851 this is an abject failure of the indian state to protect the right to life of the citizens since all entry roads have been blocked with logs and the law enforcement personnel have access to remote areas of the district the hindu fundamentalists are being allowed to carry out mass killings of the christians

8935856 americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meagre record of barack obama
8935857 when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 us dollars 22 900 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way
8935858 specific bold solutions and optimistic vision for our nation and our childrens future
8935859 his speech crystallized the clear choice between he and senator mccain
8935860 you see everyone wants everything thats the way the world is but i just might actually get it
8935861 i was crying the whole time i didnt know what to do
8935862 we didnt know what was happening because everyone started running some people thought it was a bomb but then we figured out it was immigration
8935863 basically they create a major humanitarian crisis for families and spouses and children
8935864 the question is what they are doing with people when they are arrested
8935865 its an immoral very anti human anti family act they split families and create terror in the latino community they go in shake down the plant put people in shackles and chains carry them to jail have them arraigned and often they are put in jails with real criminals
8935866 we are deeply concerned by reports that workers at the factory where the raid occurred were segregated by race or ethnicity and interrogated the factory was locked down for several hours workers were denied access to counsel and ice failed to inform family members and lawyers following the raid where the workers were being jailed

8935880 when the cake arrived at clarence house moyra was told she could have a slice from the top tier to keep for herself
8935881 this piece is special because it was from the cake sent to the queen mother at clarence house moyra must have been very well thought of by the royal family to have been given this slice from the top of the cake
8935882 she worked there for five years in all from 1981 to 1986 and we had some happy times

8935895 what draws me to them aside from the fact that theyre a huge lot of fun i dont know
8935896 but i know that when i used to see action movies there was this charge that i would get and it would be like recharging my batteries
8935897 i would come out the theatre either doing whatever fight moves were in there or fantasising about whatever cool scene so i do them i guess for the fan of action movies that i am
8935898 i was talking to my father and i said dad after babylon should i do another action movie or go back the other direction and a drama
8935899 i do not want to talk about what you understand about this world i want to know what you will do about it i do not want to know what you hope i want to know what you will work for i do not want your sympathy for the needs of humanity i want your muscle
8935900 i think that made a difference in getting the account
8935901 it separated us from everybody else and it illustrates my philosophy a lot of people dont have the courage to make change before they need to theyll say dont rock the boat everything is going around fine
8935902 making consistent deposits and building up good will and your companys reputation over time is a great way to fix things before they break and that approach resonated with me
8935903 somebody from a radio station told me he had met kroc the day before and he had a concept that was very interesting
8935904 id never heard of mcdonalds at that point in fact nobody had heard of it
8935905 ray had a small office in downtown chicago and he told me come over
8935906 too many people are so intent on trying to impress somebody with what they want to say they dont listen
8935907 i thought it would be an entr e in to the movie business
8935908 in those days there wasnt that great an awareness of what public relations was and what it could do for a company
8935909 so we had to do an educational job with our prospective clients first we had to tell them what it was and why they needed it and then why they should hire us it was a difficult sale at that point

8936000 it is not improbable that belarusian popular front party will adopt decision to withdraw its candidates
8936001 minsk would in the next day or two recognize the independence of sukhumi and tskhinvali ambassador
8936002 belarus would in the next day or two recognize the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia

8936007 it is not improbable that belarusian popular front party will adopt decision to withdraw its candidates
8936008 i think that from my earlier statements the regime understood that i will criticize the electoral farce which is intended for western viewers
8936009 i was denied registration and i am charged with libeling officials it means that the first stage of the electoral campaign has been carried out by me excellently thats the opinion of my team my friends and mine and i am convinced that it is a hidden thought of those who persecute me and deny registration to me every election campaign now the second stage called boycott starts
8936010 the first deputy chairman of hrodna city executive committee vasil stsyapura is nominated in masty now we are going to file a complaint to the central electoins committee

8936012 alyaksandr apanasyuk was asked about a motorbike he had in the 1970ies there is no this bike now certainly and he does not have much property in general but they have found a formal ground
8936013 i view all the events related to the elections rather coolly i even havent visited the session of the electoral commission where i was registered i am convinced that more than a half of our nominees could fight for a deputy seat under just conditions
8936014 having collected more than 500 signatures in minsk and in other parts of the country i can surely say that only about 2 3 of voters support the idea of the boycott
8936015 mikulin had problems with signatures allegedly kamarouski submitted 1002 signatures for a check they told its not enough for registration but in pukhavichy saldatsenka was registered with 1004 signatures iryna veshtart is a person well known in smarhon she was a deputy of the city council several times i think her chances could be very high
8936016 it would be good when 20 persons would be registered out of 51
8936017 im not supporter of boycott we must show we havent died

8936050 you can imagine my surprise when i was shown how i was to make my first entrance to the stage i had to climb up a very high ladder in the back of the castle maybe 15 feet high and then crawl through one of those cannon holes usually in pouring rain barely big enough to fit through and then once in this small rough room i had to climb another very steep and high ladder to another room and then make my way down a cave like passageway to the stage

8936096 they want another female in case paula misses a taping

8936100 doctors are the stars of our society people like my grandfather who was responsible for the health care in canada as well as teachers firefighters and police officers

8936102 miley cyrus is just a little too tarty forgive me i dont want her to look like shes going into a convent school but its just a little too much for a 15 year old if i didnt know better id swear she was 25
8936103 they walk around telling each other how great they are and i keep saying to them someone is gonna go home

8936115 believe it or not there are many evangelicals who are not hung up on abortion and gay issues these are the ones obama has failed to impress tonight i guess he conceded them to mccain
8936116 i dont know anything about her politics but shes photogenic as hell
8936117 im not going to be there i plan to be at the state fair you can draw your conclusion from that
8936118 a 2002 literature review of elective abortion rates found that 9193 of pregnancies with a diagnosis of down syndrome were terminated
8936119 that would seem to leave bobby jindal kay bailey hutchison or rob portman
8936120 if its palin the issue that she knew she was going to have a down syndrome baby and did not abort like 91 93 of those in the same circumstance will be huge
8936121 climate models that predict continued loss of sea ice the main habitat of polar bears during summers are unreliable
8936122 if its palin the issue that she knew she was going to have a down syndrome baby and did not abort like 91 93 of those in the same circumstance will be huge
8936123 if its palin the issue that she knew she was going to have a down syndrome baby and did not abort like 91 93 of those in the same circumstance will be huge
8936124 if mccain can peel away about 15 of hillarys votes suddenly its a very very tight race
8936125 why would it be so hard to believe that someone who is holding an irrational grudge would vote for mccain
8936126 but well see if obamas elected therell be a lot of people doing acid
8936127 gotta say mccains choice is a lot more sensible and gutsy than obamas was the more time biden spends on tv the more his polls go down im betting its not true with her
8936128 among people who identified themselves as hillary clinton supporters 28 percent said they would vote for mccain if obama is his opponent the march 7 22 gallup poll daily election tracking survey found
8936129 my husband has an interesting theory i thought i drop in here he thinks mcbush intends to drop out of the race before the election
8936130 watching him think on his feet in a painful experience
8936131 polls a few months ago ill admit i wonder if all those people have changed their minds
8936132 were you in this just for me or for the principles and values we believe in
8936133 the chicago tribune and nbc reports that john mccain has chosen alaska gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate
8936134 and will no doubt make up for any obama bounce
8936135 which is why he did so well in the primary right
8936136 yet perhaps the biggest factor keeping the presidential race close has been obamas inability to close the deal with some of hillary clintons supporters according to the poll 52 percent of them say they will vote for obama but 21 percent are backing mccain with an additional 27 percent who are undecided or want to vote for someone else
8936137 no hes only served his country honorable in military service became a war hero and has served more than two decades in the senate
8936138 as a former runner up for miss alaska i personally believe that u s americans are unable to do so because uh some people out there in our nation dont have maps and uh i believe that our uh education like such as uh south africa and uh the iraq everywhere like such as and i believe that they should our education over here in the u s should help the u s uh or uh should help south africa and should help the iraq and the asian countries so we will be able to build up our future for our children

8936151 yesterday i visited the visa and registration office of maskouski district in order to find out whether i can go abroad i was said that i cannot the reason for that they told was a criminal case opened against me on july 29 2008 i was given a document about that i do not understand what is this all about if minsk blast case is meant in connection with which i was kept in the kgb remand prison on july 16 18 it was brought up much earlier

8936153 it is the right of belarus whether it will recognise the sovereignty or wont but frankly speaking we count on this because it is the closest partner of the russian federation
8936154 there are no such things as collective recognition in the world
8936155 it is difficult to say whether a question of recognition was discussed the situation was different at that time
8936156 we dont exclude development in this direction though it is rather difficult

8936200 america we are better than these last eight years we are a better country than this
8936201 its not fair getting backdoored for something i didnt even do
8936202 youre about to experience a weeks worth of big brother in a single night
8936203 its a special double eviction tonight two of you will be leaving the house and at the end of the hour only five will remain
8936204 i just want to say how grateful and thankful i am to have been here
8936205 when you vote vote for yourself not for the person next to you if its benefiting them its not benefiting you if it benefits you for me to stay here then please vote for me to stay
8936206 i think i was the target the whole time i think he was playing a little game
8936207 i think he may be a plant in the house personally i think theres something more to dan than meets the eye one plus one does not equal two to dan something just isnt right about him and everything is more than just a game he basically wants to make a fool of everybody in the house thats what i personally think by what he did made himself look better in everybodys eyes and made everybody hate each other
8936208 well he might be the ultimate player in this game because im here to tell you hes not a plant and you are sitting here evicted purely by game play by your fellow housemates
8936209 here we are double eviction and you have the opportunity to play another game you like to play games lets play another game of roulette and hopefully ill get lucky
8936210 it hasnt had a lot of time to set in yet but thats the name of the game expect the unexpected
8936211 you really cant be blindsided by anything that happens in this game and it was my turn i guess
8936212 im a little upset because i didnt compete as well as i wanted to im a competitor
8936213 but at the same time things dont always go your way and i am really thankful for the opportunity that i did have in the house
8936214 its not about me being upset with dan its about me being a little confused of why he did it
8936215 obviously you do things in this game to help your game and advance your game to the following weeks but at the same time i dont know if that was the best decision for him obviously it worked in his favor for now but in terms of the rest of the houseguests i dont know how they feel about him doing something like that
8936216 i think thats what it boiled down to it boiled down to an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth we were at a level where i got him and he supposedly got me back
8936217 its all within the game but the thing i didnt like is he got everyone involved and sort of mocked everyone and thats what i got upset about
8936218 hopefully a bright future ive never met anybody like her and shes the first person ive told that to
8936219 hopefully nobody like that disappears fast out of my life i plan to keep her around as long as i can

8936240 then he had a cardiogram test done and that test shows that he has the bones of an eight year old boy but they have not told me where that came from
8936241 the baby will have tests done to see if hes obese or were dealing with hyperthyroidism
8936242 there was no unanimous support to respond positively to these requests now
8936243 the council will continue to discuss the participation of south ossetia and abkhazia and will intensify these discussions at a more opportune moment

8936245 i hear over and over from residents that they want guelph to return to being a top performer in waste management and diversion
8936246 this is a plan to help us get there built upon a vision of zero waste

8936249 i established sunpark seven years ago to build a solar park in the guelph area
8936250 since then the initiative much like solar energy itself has grown and evolved we quickly recognized that sunpark could be about more than a solar park we now focus on both the park and developing ways to bring solar energy into everyones life we strive to make solar technology accessible effective and visible and have begun developing customized solar projects for our sponsors that not only increase environmental awareness but capture public interest
8936251 as a city known for its ambitious conservation initiatives guelph is proud to be the home of sunpark energy
8936252 a built in guelph business with an eye on sustainability sunpark energy presents an exciting opportunity for guelph and the rest of canada and its an outstanding example of how the people of guelph make important differences locally and globally

8936263 was part of the weather underground in the 1970s they bombed the pentagon the capitol and other buildings hes never apologized for that
8936264 the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago when i was eight years old somehow reflects on me and my values doesnt make much sense george
8936265 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
8936266 we meant to kill that judge and his family not just damage the porch
8936267 i think he might be a plant in the house
8936268 personally i think theres something more to dan than meets the eye one plus one does not equal two to dan something just isnt right about him and everythings more than just a game
8936269 well he might be the ultimate player of this game because im here to tell you he was not a plant and you are sitting here evicted purely by game play by your fellow housemates who are all just like you total strangers who went in
8936270 one of the biggest challenges in regenerative medicine is to have a graded continuous interface because anatomically thats how the majority of tissues appear and there are studies that strongly suggest that the graded interface provides better integration and load transfer
8936271 every organ in our body is made up of complex heterogeneous structures so the ability to engineer tissues that more closely mimic these natural architectures is a critical challenge for the next wave of tissue engineering
8936272 it is apparent that the stage of disease incubation in infected donors played a large role in the likelihood of transmission the longer that bse or scrapie had been carried by donors the greater the likelihood of the disease being transmitted with transfusions of infected blood
8936273 the study shows that for sheep infected with bse or scrapie transmission rates via blood transfusion can be high particularly when donors are in the later stages of infection
8936274 while it may not correlate directly to what happens in the human population due to factors such as species differences in genetic susceptibility to disease it provides greater insight into the role of how vcjd may be carried through infected blood by understanding how vcjd can be transmitted through blood transfusions we can ensure the most effective control measures to minimise human to human infection

8936276 an investigation into the effects of gum chewing on mood and cortisol levels during psychological stress
8936277 in the meeting of latin american cardiologists we will offer participants the possibility to have their eye tested for early changes of radiation effect that may lead to cataract in future years
8936278 this will allow us to assess retrospectively what radiation dose these cardiologists received and then correlate the data with changes in their lens hopefully this will help them protect themselves better in the future and reduce further radiation in their eyes while maintaining the clinical load
8936279 we started training courses for cardiologists in 2004 and so far cardiologists from more than 50 countries have been trained in radiation protection
8936280 its really the only time in your life that youre supposed to gain weight
8936281 they say that youre eating for two but you have to remember that one of the two is only five ounces its not the same
8936282 it was brutal i would order my favorite things from restaurants and i would get it and say get that thing away from me grilled chicken or tomatoes would be the worst i would tell my husband to get it away from me
8936283 all i wanted was cheerios it was all i could eat for two months
8936284 i definitely have a sweet tooth with this pregnancy that i didnt have with my son with my son i craved savory things my doctor said to buy fruit at the farmers market i bought a cantaloupe and i had to stop myself from eating the whole thing i cut it up and put it in this big bowl and then next thing i knew half of it was gone
8936285 driving the r8 is like smearing honey into keira knightly
8936286 in principle this car is too fast for my thoughts
8936287 why dont you negotiate using the mnlf model because we cannot determine the exact shape of this milf model
8936288 we have been arguing over the past three weeks and the milf model is unrecognizable under our constitution and international law
8936289 the moa will be signed in front of all the dignitaries and yet the office of the president has no idea of its contents
8936290 if we will follow the moa by the way it is worded we are practically giving the milf the moon and the stars
8936291 if this will not be implemented the milf and the international state may feel deceived because there is no assurance that congress will go along with what the executive wants
8936292 petitioners believed that there is a potential injury if this document will be signed there is a potential injury here
8936293 thus the word potential what do you understand by the word potential on that account mootness cannot be invoked
8936294 do you believe that this court cannot issue advisory positions
8936295 to rule upon acts of the government despite its political in nature if there is grave abuse of discretion
8936296 applied to this case it may be that we want to avoid repetition of violation of the constitution
8936297 does this mean that the moa will be set aside
8936298 because it will not be signed means it will be set aside
8936299 so youre saying that there is nothing formal that will indicate that the government will not sign the document
8936300 are you aware that under international law declaration of consensus points is already binding
8936301 under international law it does not matter if an agreement violates our internal rules we must comply with our international obligations
8936302 a case can be brought by malaysia to the icj they can compel us to amend our constitution
8936303 you can see the danger that could have happened if that document moa ad was signed
8936304 they have to inquire as to the nature of the document we never acceded to make this an international document
8936305 a domestic document subject to internal laws of the state
8936306 if the intention of this document is to make this a political agreement then this is not subject to the jurisdiction of the icj
8936307 the mans charisma his unquenchable thirst for life his devotion to family his surefire ability to find a suitable scapegoat his empathetic sensitivity matched only by his emphatic refusal to accept responsibility

8936309 were doing this from a social responsibility perspective but its also become necessary to maintain tenants
8936310 its gotten to the point where not taking action is somewhat foolish
8936311 great speech we all should be proud that a black person finally has a legitimate shot at being president which shows how far weve come in this country to eradicate racism but hes a tax and spend liberal and he has no record
8936312 they screwed me they screwed supreme court justice james graves
8936313 there has been no decision on the matter but these discussions have been ongoing for some time theres nothing new about them
8936314 frankly when i first was elected i was shocked that this was the way theyve always done it because these positions require a lot of responsibility and a lot of work
8936315 i believe the positions should be based on competence and diligence
8936316 the internal deliberations of the court and documents concerning those deliberations are not subject to public disclosure
8936317 its been in effect for 30 something years but they feel they can do anything they dont care what the law says theyll strip me of my seniority theyve got an african american judge judge james graves and they think they can strip him of his seniority too
8936318 it would be comparable to the supreme court trying to dictate to the house how to elects a house speaker
8936319 six of the judges are under the control of big business ive never been bought by anybody and theyre scared to death that im going to rise up
8936320 smith is chief and presiding judges are william waller and oliver diaz polls show smith losing and diaz losing the last poll i saw shows im winning and if that happens im going to be in second place and a heartbeat away from being chief theyre trying to maintain their control
8936321 i always keep my list thats my personal data thats my personal information
8936322 three of the six who want this thing to happen are the rules committee
8936323 its an illegal act im taking them to court win or lose if they want to fight they can get ready to strap it on
8936324 at a global macroeconomic level the costs of transitioning to a low carbon economy are not in an economic welfare sense all that daunting even with currently known technologies
8936325 we have been fairly conservative in our assumptions about technological progress in these projections
8936326 wir wollten gerne n chste woche bei ihnen vorbei kommen

8936331 the the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping ak 47s out of the hands of criminals
8936332 because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare voters
8936333 you understand that in this election the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result

8936345 we have formulated conditions under which the bpf party wont take part in the elections
8936346 we didnt announce boycott at once as our activists wanted to work with voters to try hand to analyze actions of the regime and to be convinced that the regime doesnt make it possible to carry out a normal electoral campaign rigging the results of the belarusian citizens will expression is the major problem that is why including democrats in precinct election commissions where rigging is taking place is very important if democrats wont become members of the precinct elections commissions votes of people wont be count and then gathering on the square is a real alternative to going to a polling station a voice can be heard on the square

8936351 according to the health inspector it was listeria although i was told by two big cheese suppliers that it cant be listeria
8936352 i was told that one lady got sick from consuming one of our cheeses but i have no word as to which cheese she got from us or if its our cheese for sure as to when she bought it and what she had done to that cheese before she ate it you know what i mean so its up in the air right now and my heart goes out to that lady who had bought cheese from us
8936353 for this case we are investigating her to see if shes related to the maple leaf foods outbreak but at the same time we know she consumed a lot of cheese at this particular cheese store
8936354 were not sure right now were waiting for her specific dna fingerprint to come back but we do know cheeses especially soft cheeses can be high risk for listeria especially for pregnant women
8936355 now what do we do do we go to montreal do we go back to air canada air canada i think cant take it all
8936356 one of the things we do when we give out the samples is we tell people about how we get the different varieties of honey and its also just very difficult to describe the flavour of something like honey the best way is to let people taste it for themselves
8936357 our main goal here is to minimize any risk of illness we do realize that there have been a number of different outbreaks associated with this form of setting
8936358 he said we werent allowed to serve food so we decided to describe our honey as an antibacterial mouthwash he didnt seem too amused
8936359 bojan puede decidir si quiere jugar con espa a o con serbia

8936365 ellos se quedan en sus clubes e imagino que felices me preocupar a m s la inestabilidad que tendr an si no hubieran decidido su futuro
8936366 ayer no entren pero hoy lo hizo con toda normalidad y contamos con l como los 20 que hemos convocado
8936367 es muy bueno que espa a acuda a la champions con cuatro equipos nos gustar a que tengan m s jugadores espa oles pero es una realidad de los pa ses que nos rodea
8936368 los cuatro clubes representan al f tbol espa ol que el grupo sea f cil o dif cil es una situaci n a priori

8936380 due to the restructuring activities planned for the fourth quarter
8936381 we believe the companys large cash balance and strong cash flows from its legacy business will continue to provide support to the stock and the continuation of the steady performance delivered over the last six quarters will help move some investors from the sidelines
8936382 continues to deliver strong quarterly results that demonstrate its ability to drive consistent margin expansion and solid growth the decline in services revenue is masking an increasingly attractive growth profile which coupled with the hundreds of basis points of leverage left to realize leaves us increasingly confident that owning novell will pay off for long term investors
8936383 avresti potuto telefonare qualche volta farti sentire mandare un emme esse esse
8936384 sono anni che non vieni a trovare i tuoi nonni per non parlare di tuo fratello poi
8936385 vi siete entrambi dimenticati di avere due nonni che vi hanno insegnato a guidare e vi hanno lavato le vostre luride mutande
8936386 ma tesoro tu non mangi da una vita sei magrissimo cadi a pezzi june aveva ragione
8936387 entra subito vai a mettere lo zaino nella tua stanza lavati le mani e scendi di corsa stavamo per metterci a tavola
8936388 o pretendi che io e tuo nonno ti rincorriamo come quanderi piccolo non siamo pi giovani come un tempo e gi allora non lo eravamo affatto quindi non avanzare simili pretese e vieni a baciare la tua vecchia nonna
8936389 ricordi quando si nascondeva e per ore intere non riuscivamo a trovarlo qui nella brughiera
8936390 ed sei cresciuto ancora di pi non avremo problemi a ritrovarti la prossima volta
8936391 nonna adesso sono abbastanza alto da poterti sostituire le lampadine
8936392 perch quanderi piccolo ne hai fulminate cos tante per sovraccarico che ti toccher risarcirci
8936393 ed cresciuto qui sa benissimo com fatta la casa e dove sistemarsi
8936394 alec non mi aveva mai detto che aveva una figlia albina
8936395 ma a me sembra chiaro che per una minima percentuale tu lo sia i tuoi capelli
8936396 avresti avuto capelli rossi o forse biondi se non fosse stato per quellanomalia
8936397 tu invece sophie sei una fusione perfetta tra i tuoi genitori fisicamente caratterialmente non saprei ma vedervi conoscervi unemozione
8936398 ed non ti sembra che sia uguale a suo padre eh
8936399 a sua madre semmai ha il suo viso le sue espressioni guardalo bene
8936400 e poi non gli auguro affatto di somigliare al padre
8936401 nessun padre userebbe il suo figlio miracoloso per moltiplicare la pizza e la birra
8936402 se sei interessato alla verit non credere a qualcosa che non puoi verificare
8936403 non mai accaduto niente del genere e solo io posso garantirtelo perch ho vissuto con mio padre
8936404 ero troppo piccolo ma ricordo ricordo benissimo i miei genitori e la tua affermazione su mio padre avrebbe ferito mia madre
8936405 ricordo benissimo che mickey avrebbe voluto fare qualcosa salvare mia madre i suoi amici e ricordo benissimo che era intrappolato dallaltra parte e gi si tormentava perch non voleva che mio padre sopravvivesse e ricordo anche te giovane ed e il tuo amore impossibile e se io non fossi nato se io non fossi stato figlio di mio padre qualcosa avrebbe comunque fatto s che quellincendio si verificasse e se i genitori di sophie e luna non fossero mai morti no giovane ed la madre di luna non ti avrebbe mai amato
8936406 quindi sei libero smettila di tormentarti ed avresti avuto questa stessa vita ma sarebbe stato peggio perch non avresti saputo sostenere lo sguardo della piccola luna
8936407 nulla che tu voglia sentirti dire ma qualcosa che dovresti ascoltare
8936408 iniziate pure a mangiare io e il signor mickey torniamo subito
8936409 s iniziate a mangiare parlate pure degli studi di mickey ha fatto corsi su corsi di fotografia e regia abile
8936410 e vero hai le espressioni di tua madre ma linvolucro tutto tuo padre
8936411 anzi mi dispiace fargli posticipare il pranzo so che affamato ha fatto un lungo viaggio per venire qui
8936412 s io non io non credevo che tu saresti stato che tu fossi davvero cos
8936413 non lo credeva nessuno eppure si sapeva da un sacco di tempo interi anni lunghi anni dattesa a volte mia madre mi chiamava
8936414 s e mi dispiaceva dirle di no ma non era il momento della mia venuta tu soffri perch sei dalla parte sbagliata il tuo posto al di l del muro
8936415 no non devi affatto morire come del resto nemmeno loro la morte non esiste ci sono solo pi mondi pi luoghi pi tempi
8936416 la tristezza che prende la gente perch sanno che chi sta loro a cuore se ne va va da unaltra parte e tu non appartieni a questo luogo
8936417 sono il figlio di mio padre e so che sei una brava persona ma non avrei potuto avere un padre migliore di lui e facile giudicare ci che non si conosce ma la gente non capisce che giudicare che ad essere sbagliato si chieder chi sono da dove vengo non perch mi chiamo cos e se il viaggio mi ha stancato sono anni che gli incubi ti tormentano eppure se ti guardi intorno sei libero domani andrai
8936418 per salutare i nonni prima che tu vada via non ti avrebbero mai perdonato se te ne fossi andato via cos
8936419 rimarr qui ma sar sempre con te ne parlerai nelle tue canzoni parlerai di tutti noi dormirai e a volte ci sognerai tutti quanti
8936420 sei sempre stato libero di andare mickey ma sapevi che il tuo amore ti avrebbe seguito ovunque
8936421 s giusto ma te li avevo ridati dicendoti che ti sarebbero serviti
8936422 perdona te stesso anche potendo fare qualcosa e arrivando in tempo mia madre non sarebbe sopravvissuta
8936423 tutto si scrive man mano non si pu mai dire come sarebbero andate le cose perch non ne abbiamo la prova
8936424 perch mio padre fece ogni cosa in suo potere per salvare me e lei e le sue capacit erano enormi sebbene in cuor tuo tu non le abbia mai riconosciute
8936425 lo consideravi un insetto che si dava troppa importanza eppure allo stesso modo desideravi essere come lui avere ci che lui aveva e persino essere tu mio padre
8936426 s il suo aspetto la sua personalit la sua storia non lo ritenevo giusto eppure i riflettori erano lui che illuminavano
8936427 sognavi un ritorno dei meravigliosi tempi in cui lui part e mia madre era tua lhai avuta per un breve periodo di tempo e lhai amata credendo che anche lei ti amasse e invece aspettava il suo ritorno
8936428 no sono il ritratto di mio padre e di mia madre insieme dalla tua storia con lei sono nate canzoni ma io potevo nascere solo da quel sentimento e io ero necessario a lei come a lui lo stare con te le fece solo capire quanto lui le sarebbe mancato per sempre
8936429 quando lui torn tu ti sentisti buttato via anche se in cuor tuo sapevi che sarebbe accaduto ti allontanasti da alec e fosti tu a partire stringesti amicizia con ed perch lui era innamorato della madre di luna ma lui non la ebbe mai sebbene sempre quando eravate ragazzi fu lei ad innamorarsi di te e tu pensavi a mia madre
8936430 a volte penso che dovrei dire a luna e sophie che mia madre e le loro non erano poi cos amiche loro hanno in mente questidea delle tre amiche del cuore e sarebbero molto deluse non voglio che soffrano capisci ma io so
8936431 continui a voler sapere di pi di loro se vuoi rivedere mia madre guardami in viso e se vedrai particolari del volto di mio padre continua a guardare perch lei era questo che era solo unaltra parte di mio padre
8936432 non smetter mai di parlare di loro e un giorno al di l di quel muro rivedr tutti quanti
8936433 una volta l asseconda le provocazioni di mio padre un muro non basta ad abbattere il suo orgoglio ma tutta scena
8936434 non desideravo nientaltro che questo incontrarti parlavano sempre cos tanto di te tutti quanti
8936435 so che luna e sophie sono dietro di noi possono venire qui a farmi compagnia comunicaglielo

8936462 the bodys molecular bodyguards evolved to protect us from naturally occurring threats but there are ways to activate them deliberately one is by eating lots of fruits and vegetables there is plenty of evidence that a diet rich in plant material will help reduce your risk of cardiovascular disease cancer and some neurodegenerative disorders the standard explanation for this is that fruit and vegetables contain high levels of antioxidants such as carotenoids and flavonoids these neutralise damaging chemicals called free radicals that are an unavoidable by product of metabolism at first glance this makes sense given that free radical damage has been implicated in cardiovascular disease cancer and neurodegenerative diseases however most plant antioxidants only mop up free radicals at high concentrations that cannot be achieved by eating normal amounts of fruit and vegetables also clinical trials of high dose antioxidants have failed to show that they can prevent or treat these diseases so if not antioxidants then what tellingly antioxidants are part of a wider class of plant chemicals called phytochemicals that are toxic at high doses but beneficial at lower doses these are probably natural pesticides that evolved to deter herbivores the amounts we normally eat are insufficient to reach toxic concentrations in the human body but are enough to activate our molecular stress responses in other words they are hormetic stressors

8936562 dis is not dying were having a small rethink and going back to our roots tho for various reasons perhaps its because something transcendental seems to happen every year after reading festival because it is where over several drinks the plan to launch both my first email fanzine and drowned in sound were considered concocted and confirmed things have changed both a little and a lot since those heady teenage days which have gone to prove with enough enthusiasm everything was and still is possible
8936563 these past few weeks have been odd around dis but id just like to take this opportunity to thank those weve sadly had to make redundant for all of their hard and wonderful work a very special public thank you goes out to mister mike diver who is utterly irreplaceable and will be missed but will hopefully continue writing after his marriage id also like to quash all rumours that dis is likely to disappear in a puff of burning promo smoke some things can weather any storm and dis really isnt going anywhere except onwards and upwards in fact theres a face lift is going on behind the scenes to improve things especially the community features

8936578 humans frequently invoke an argument that their intuition can result in a better decision than conscious reasoning such assertions may rely on subconscious associative learning
8936579 even without conscious processing of contextual cues our brain can learn their reward value and use them to provide a bias on decision making
8936580 one third of your generation has been killed by abortion in america
8936581 i was peacefully sidewalk chalking when i was forcefully pushed to ground by a police officer from behind
8936582 as i was being cuffed on the ground the police officer pushed his knee into the back of my neck i was pulled roughly off the ground and taken away i was given no warning to stop and was completely shocked when i was arrested
8936583 i was rushed by a police officer without warning and lifted up off the ground and was cuffed i was then dragged by the police into the westin hotel
8936584 it was understood by the young women that sidewalk chalk was an accepted medium and they were given no warning by the police before being cuffed and dragged away
8936585 i think the officers were keyed up were not sure whether they acted of their own accord or had orders
8936586 i am horrified and outraged at the treatment of these two girls not only were they legally expressing their opinions on the public sidewalk but they were doing so peacefully and without incident the officers acted without provocation and should be ashamed of themselves for terrorizing two young women
8936587 i am also appalled that the city of denver boasted of the citys preparation for the convention but clearly neglected to train their police force to respect the first amendment and the rights of citizens to peacefully demonstrate
8936588 the city of denver sent a clear message to civic minded young people this week the first amendment doesnt apply here
8936589 i am shocked at how cowardly these police officers behaved by attacking little girls without warning or provocation
8936590 if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from
8936591 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it and to institute new government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness prudence indeed will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

8936601 dick cheney held a meeting where they considered putting navy seals on fake iranian pt boats to attack an american boat to provoke a war with iran fortunately this idea was rejected
8936602 does anyone have any ideas how we might overcome this
8936603 give me your best thoughts off the record and think outside the box
8936604 the one thing he did that put a big smile on my face is he asked coach monty williams to come in at night and work with him
8936605 so he was doing two a days working with dean demopoulos in the morning and monty at night and he did it himself he would come back at night and work on his footwork with monty and for me thats good thats great he is on schedule where jay jensen and the trainers want him to be
8936606 seriously threaten our quality of life particularly that of the most vulnerable people
8936607 we need to concentrate efforts to slash carbon emissions and become more energy efficient in order to prevent dangerous climate change
8936608 but we also need to prepare for how our climate is expected to change in the future
8936609 these are all good measures we have got to do all these things
8936610 but where are the big new ideas we need the mayor to find ways to reduce our dependence on oil for example
8936611 thats the promise of america the idea that we are responsible for ourselves but that we also rise or fall as one nation the fundamental belief that i am my brothers keeper
8936612 i am a bit of a surprised to be perfectly honest i dont think it was anything that was mentioned
8936613 we hope he can stay fit because if he does he is a fantastic footballer he is very quick he is mobile he has got a good touch and good hold up play and he can score goals
8936614 hes a fantastic player and under normal circumstances you would not want to lose a player like him
8936615 i want to stress it was 100 my decision to sell him though
8936616 it was difficult for him he almost signed for them once and got dragged back
8936617 i wish him all the best in the world hes a player ive really enjoyed working with and im sure martin oneill will enjoy working with him as well because you cant help but enjoy working with good professionals
8936618 i wouldnt have sold him if i didnt believe at the end of the day we would move this club forward and thats what were going to do
8936619 when you weigh it up its right for everybody the lads done nothing wrong the fans shouldnt think bad about him at the end of the day he wanted it and good luck to him
8936620 despite the fact that to our fans it wont look like a positive move im convinced what will happen in the next two or three days and in the future for this club will be positive
8936621 the owners absolutely committed to the club theres no doubt about that
8936622 its a case of us trying to get the quality we want to bring in its very easy to bring players in at this time of year
8936623 the secret is if youre going to let a good player go to replace him for another player who can maybe take you in another direction
8936624 ooo we take our shirts off so that makes us the best fans in the country
8936625 its been a tremendous experience but im going to be honest with you the profession is dying
8936626 i dont think either paper sun times or chicago tribune is going to survive
8936627 to showcase your work you need a stellar web site and if a newspaper doesnt have that you cant be stuck in the 20th century with your old newspaper
8936628 thats jays opinion he has plenty of them but the facts of course say something different im going with the facts well its turning nasty and thats typical of jay to throw a bomb on the way out of a place that cared for him nurtured him paid him well for 17 years
8936629 basically we cant sing we cant dance all we can do is la la

8936647 this step is biased and aimed at justifying the aggressive actions of georgia
8936648 i dont think the contemporary west has any means to punish a state that is not quite a rogue state
8936649 the kremlin didnt take tbilisi and didnt shoot mikheil saakashvili what the west can really do expelling russia from the g8 or the world trade organisation isnt important
8936650 strategically putin has increased his personal power and satisfied his personal feeling towards mr saakashvili the war was quite brilliant in its design
8936651 i think they are watching very closely to see what will happen at the eu summit on monday
8936652 but i think the kremlin calculation is that the eu wont react seriously

8936662 sabemos de su calidad y queremos saber el ritmo que puede tener en un equipo europeo
8936663 m s operativo y gil en la toma de decisiones
8936664 se limit a salir del paso y no aport nada nuevo a lo anteriormente dicho muchas l neas generales y poca concreci n respecto a c mo va a ser el reparto y a c mo se va a financiar pues las cuentas del estado se asientan ahora mismo nada menos que con un d ficit de 10 000 millones de euros
8936665 ya no saben por donde salir respecto a la financiaci n auton mica porque sus socios catalanes no dejan de apretarles la soga al cuello y el nico culpable de ello es zapatero que no supo decir no cuando deb a y cuando se le avisaba desde todos los frentes
8936666 ahora ya no es el momento de echarse atr s
8936667 veremos que hacen sin el apoyo de sus aliados del pasado pues al gobierno le son m s que necesarios si quieren seguir gobernando y s lo para empezar la aprobaci n de los presupuestos generales ya genera muchas dudas
8936668 la reivindicaci n de una financiaci n justa no es una cuesti n m s sino algo primordial e irrenunciable pues las cifras no dejan lugar a dudas y evidencian que la comunitat valenciana est siendo marginada por el ejecutivo central de manera sistem tica
8936669 recibimos la mitad de lo que recibe andaluc a aunque crecemos el doble
8936670 somos de las autonom a que m s dinero devuelve a sus contribuyentes nuestra presi n fiscal se ha reducido de manera dr stica y esto debe verse recompensado pues la generosidad del gobierno valenciano no puede interpretarse como una cuesti n aislada sino como ejemplo y como un valor que debe primar a la hora de que el presidente del gobierno decida c mo ha de repartirse el dinero de todos
8936671 pintan muy mal para el gobierno socialista que ahora comienza a pagar todos sus enga os del pasado empezando por el estatuto de catalu a y acabando por la p sima gesti n econ mica de la que ha hecho gala durante los ltimos cuatro a os y que ahora le ha estallado de manera evidente y rotunda
8936672 el que haga un modelo que trate en justicia a los valencianos
8936673 corregir todos los problemas y deficiencias que tiene el modelo actual y garantizar una financiaci n por habitante ajustada teniendo en cuenta cu les son los factores que inciden en el coste de prestaci n de servicio para garantizar de verdad la igualdad de acceso a los servicios p blicos fundamentales de todos los ciudadanos independientemente de donde vengan
8936674 en la necesidad de reformar el modelo actual porque es un mal modelo
8936675 impide que haya actualizaci n de variables clave como la poblaci n
8936676 entre ellas la m s afectada es la comunitat valenciana
8936677 la tercera comunidad que menos financiaci n por habitante recibe por detr s de baleares y madrid
8936678 tienen una renta per c pita superior a la media nacional
8936679 en parte a la falta de un modelo de crecimiento econ mico
8936680 insolidario injusto mal negociado por la generalitat valenciana y mal planteado por el gobierno del pp
8936681 una comunidad que recibe menos recursos por habitante y que tiene menos renta por habitante
8936682 en el lado contrario hay comunidades como cantabria y la rioja que tienen una renta per c pita superior a la media nacional y que reciben una financiaci n por habitante 17 puntos por encima de la media
8936683 el modelo actual de financiaci n fue identificado en su momento como el modelo zaplana porque era base de la propuesta que hizo la generalitat valenciana en su momento
8936684 ahora excusarse en pedir m s recursos de un modelo que no lo puede corregir como el actual es reconocer claramente que es un mal modelo
8936685 espero que camps lo reconozca y que sea capaz de presentar una propuesta
8936686 ya en diciembre de 2006 en el consejo de pol tica fiscal y financiera de aquel a o se pidi a todas las comunidades aut nomas que hicieran una valoraci n de c mo estaba funcionando el modelo de financiaci n en su comunidad
8936687 de las comunidades gobernadas por el pp s lo castilla y le n present una propuesta
8936688 el que haga un modelo que trate en justicia a los valencianos y que aporte los recursos que necesitan para garantizar la igualdad de acceso a los servicios p blicos a la educaci n a la sanidad y a los servicios sociales
8936689 intentamos ofrecer a las v ctimas de cualquier delito una atenci n especializada e interdisciplinar para paliar al menos los efectos de la victimizaci n secundaria los derivados del contacto de la v ctima con el sistema jur dico penal si no podemos evitar la victimizaci n primaria el hecho delictivo en s

8936708 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in inter ethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8936709 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8936710 we have serious grounds to think that there were us citizens right in the combat zone
8936711 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8936712 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of us president
8936713 and if it didnt work out they could always put the blame on us make us look like the enemy and against the background of this surge of patriotism once more rally the country around a particular political force
8936714 had westerners become certain that the resolutions would bring us down to our knees they would have definitely intensified the sanctions

8937215 unmik has not been in a position to impose agreements or solutions since june 15th
8937216 we have a dialogue through a third party between pristina and belgrade the third party being the chief of unmik and that is already a positive step
8937217 actually from our perspective it would have been very helpful if such a meeting was held yesterday but because of the position of the government of serbia such a meeting was not feasible
8937218 the next plan is for the chief of unmik to meet with serbian minister for kosovo goran bogdanovic in september
8937219 pristina is ready to engage in practical talks with belgrade on a wide range of issues
8937220 the independence of kosovo is not negotiable and it can never be negotiated again
8937221 we are not prepared to engage in discussions with the secessionist provisional authorities of kosovo
8937222 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
8937223 hes a playboy hes an oakland raider hes pu ssy whipped
8937224 the population is worried its normal all things nuclear scare people but i have confidence in the experts who tell me that its without danger and that only precautionary measures are needed
8937225 theres been an incident and not an accident i dont want people to think that theres been a nuclear incident
8937226 the most promising option from al qaedas perspective is to foster and deepen its relationship with the pakistani rather than the afghan taliban
8937227 try to discredit it by arguing that it acts on behalf of external interests it will aim to provoke further intervention by foreign forces knowing that this is the one thing all the tribes will unite against
8937228 it is time to write a new chapter in our response to 9 11 when i am president we will wage the war that has to be won with a comprehensive strategy with five elements getting out of iraq and on to the right battlefield in afghanistan and pakistan developing the capabilities and partnerships we need to take out the terrorists and the worlds most deadly weapons engaging the world to dry up support for terror and extremism restoring our values and securing a more resilient homeland
8937229 an identification tag inscribed with private fishers details has been found at the site
8937230 this is an extraordinary discovery that together with the small quantity of bones recovered in the dig strongly suggests we have located the grave of private fisher and we wait with some confidence for formal identification by australian and vietnamese forensic specialists
8937231 one of the most reassuring things about the last six months the six months between nichols resignation on february the 12th and now has been how quickly and how meaningfully the various parts of the campus community came back together
8937232 thereve been a lot of relationships where these ties of trust needed to be restored
8937233 and its happened more quickly and more completely than i expected
8937234 president reveley has been simply remarkable in bringing the campus together and tackling our challenges
8937235 its looking much more unlikely that there will be a search process this year
8937236 the presidency evolved from being a pretty grim civic duty to pretty engaging challenge where i actually was having some fun
8937237 i think that hes made a commitment to the college
8937238 it would be strange to see him working so tremendously hard for what remained of last year and this year and then to stop
8937239 the state has been generous on the bricks and mortar front
8937240 the state has produced a lot of money to help us build buildings that we would not have been able to build if not for the state the
8937241 state appropriations are welcome but state funding is too unreliable to fuel our ambitions
8937242 when it comes to the operating budget the state it has become clear will no longer be a really dominant element in support
8937243 before the cuts that are coming almost certainly down the road we had thought the state would provide about 18 percent of our operating budget this year eighteen percent is a lot of help but it leaves 82 percent that has to come from private sources from tuition and fees from the yield on our endowment from annual giving from grants from anywhere we can cage private money
8937244 we are moving from a financial model that was publicly supported and privately assisted to one that is privately supported and publicly assisted
8937245 the era of being state supported and privately assisted is over is dead as a doornail is never coming back and we have no alternative but to figure out how to make an era of privately supported publicly assisted work for this college in this town
8937246 the rhythm of college and university campaigns is you start one you finish it you start planning the next one if you have your act together
8937247 what is it really that is so important so special about this particular institution
8937248 we are trying to capture that in words and get that message out in ways that really resonate with alumni resonate with politicians
8937249 were trying to raise a 10 million endowment for it which is not by any stretch of the imagination a large enough amount for it but it certainly beats the stew out of no endowment for it
8937250 and he was better at this than i if you can get yourself to stop talking and to listen to what other people are saying listen to what theyre telling you you are more likely to pursue wise policies and avoid falling into pits
8937251 what is it really that is so important so special about this particular institution
8937252 we are trying to capture that in words and get that message out in ways that really resonate with alumni resonate with politicians

8937309 during a visit to lakeland fla in may san francisco pastor michael brodeur blogged some thoughts for his church members back home who were antsy for revival
8937310 i believe this is just the beginning of a fresh wave of the holy spirit in our midst
8937311 i encourage you to put on your wet suits grab your surfboards and paddle out into the coming move of god this could be the ride of your life
8937312 our meetings have been very different from lakeland in style and form
8937313 the character of our outpouring is been much more just soaking in the presence of god and seeking his face
8937314 we cry out to god and worship and pray for the sick every night but its not lakeland or anything where 10 000 people show up
8937315 the san francisco bay area has less christians per capita than most missions fields under 3 percent the cry for revival is something that is really burning inside of us
8937316 there is a powerful wave of the holy spirit crashing upon the nations
8937317 with epicenters in lakeland fla and in other key regions we believe that the san francisco bay area is next on gods calendar
8937318 the way todd was going after god was just so impactful in my spirit
8937319 here was a guy who just wasnt going to let go somebody was breaking through somebody was not willing to play church anymore somebody was going for god
8937320 were kind of off the beaten path but some see the strategic value of san francisco
8937321 weve had many seasons where weve fasted and prayed for revival but weve never seen a significant move of god
8937322 we believe god wants to change that we believe san francisco has a redemptive gift as a people movement incubator
8937323 so many movements that have swept the nation began in san francisco and most of those have been harmful but the anointing to affect the nation in the way that san francisco has is something that the enemy didnt create its something that god created
8937324 command those who are rich to do good to be rich in good deeds and to be generous and willing to share in this way they will lay up treasure for themselves as a firm foundation for the coming age so that they may take hold of the life that is truly life
8937325 day after day they seek me out they seem eager to know my ways as if they were a nation that does what is right and has not forsaken the commands of its god
8937326 is not this the kind of fasting i have chosen to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke to set the oppressed free and break every yoke
8937327 if you do away with the yoke of oppression with the pointing finger and malicious talk and if you spend yourselves in behalf of the hungry and satisfy the needs of the oppressed then your light will rise in the darkness and your night will become like the noonday the lord will guide you always he will satisfy your needs in a sun scorched land and will strengthen your frame you will be like a well watered garden like a spring whose waters never fail
8937328 what im interested in seeing you do is sharing your food with the hungry inviting the homeless poor into your homes putting clothes on the shivering ill clad being available to your own families
8937329 i feel like if revival does not do this it is not revival there is no privatization in the kingdom of god its like a small tree that the foul perches in its branches jesus could have called it a great ceder of lebanon that the great bald eagle makes its dwelling but no a low lying bush that the unwanted birds chill in the church is a place of welcoming equipping resurrection love sacrifice true fasting hospitality generosity debt cancellation redistribution where there is no rich and no poor no stranger and no trespassers the law says that i have no right to be on private property but my brothers are rotting there awaiting hope and we must obey god rather then men
8937330 if i ever get arrested it has to be for the right reasons
8937331 we are not accountable to the people who come to revival because they are our guests they are making a free will offering and therefore should not expect an audit or an accounting
8937332 if you wonder where the money is going then dont give obviously we cant spend money the way people want us to but once it becomes a gift it is ours to use it is nobodys business how we use it
8937333 cahier de gribouillages pour les adultes qui sennuient au bureau
8937334 so where does this leave midnight sun my first feeling was that there was no way to continue writing isnt like math in math two plus two always equals four no matter what your mood is like with writing the way you feel changes everything if i tried to write midnight sun now in my current frame of mind james would probably win and all the cullens would die which wouldnt dovetail too well with the original story in any case i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely
8937335 yes but you have to add in working tax credits and housing benefit
8937336 yeah thats the sort of crap the democrats want us to do here in the us
8937337 until we the people learn how to make better decisions
8937338 peace does not mean to be in a place where there is no noise trouble or hard work peace means to be in the midst of all those things and still be calm in your heart
8937339 if youve got an event the size of the olympics and youve got billions and billions of people watching it you definitely have a backing track and mime to it because anything could go wrong
8937340 its just a safety first thing you cannot take the risk
8937341 we share artists all the time and conductors all the time
8937342 it was all prerecorded and the mso melbourne symphony orchestra did record a minority of the music that was performed
8937343 its correct that we were basically miming to a pre recording
8937344 without fear of being politically incorrect i would liken it to post partum depression
8937345 when youre training and competing its like you have this baby for months its blossoming and then suddenly its over and your whole life changes
8937346 you go from the top of the world to pushing paper answering phones all this submissive behaviour that youre not used to
8937347 the air has just come out of the tires we come back to reality immediately and it can be pretty devastating
8937348 i looked around at friends and realized that im 10 or 15 years behind my schoolmates who built up a real career for themselves
8937349 he had absolutely nothing to put on his r sum

8937351 i loved my life as an athlete and now it was gone
8937352 she was surprised at the lack of commitment among some of the people she met there
8937353 here these athletes are working with a team that wants to be great that pushes to be the best then you come back to the real world where people function at a mediocre level and its frankly less inspiring
8937354 we have a remarkable ability to be in war zones and suppress all stress symptoms
8937355 you can thank a canadian woman for bringing us todays christian fuelled republican party credit ontario raised evangelist
8937356 the flag of america and the church stand for the same thing they stand or fall together

8937358 she was one of the most influential figures in u s history
8937359 she was the first religious celebrity of the mass media era
8937360 i dont believe the wealthiest 10 of americans should get 60 of the tax breaks i think the lowest 10 should get the breaks
8937361 i am disappointed that the senate finance committee preferred instead to cut the top tax rate of 39 6 to 36 thereby granting generous tax relief to the wealthiest individuals of our country at the expense of lower and middle income american taxpayers
8937362 but when you look at the percentage of the tax cuts that as the previous tax cuts that go to the wealthiest americans you will find that the bulk of it again goes to wealthiest americans

8937425 i was thinking about what would happen if the serpent eats the apple and adam and eve have become skulls on the ground overgrown with weeds
8937426 we had a great meeting the owner is absolutely totally committed to the club there is no doubt about that and it is a case of us trying to get the quality we want in
8937427 the secret is to pick the right ones its to make sure if you are going to let a good player go you replace him with another quality player who maybe can take you in a slightly different direction as a team
8937428 thats the challenge we have now and i look forward to that i would think there is a very good chance of getting three or four players in
8937429 mike can only give us the ammunition that is the finance we have got to go and find the players and they have got to be the right players
8937430 so far we havent seen a massive influx of players into the club
8937431 but i dont think any newcastle fan would argue that the ones we have fetched in they see as quality and see as the right sort of players for newcastle united players who care and players who are putting a shirt on and doing a good shift for the club
8937432 that will continue to be the way we look for players and if because we cant get those sort of players we dont fetch the volume in and a fair number so be it
8937433 i dont think any player is untouchable thats the first thing i have got to say
8937434 thats not to say in any way shape or form that we want to see michael owen leave this club i certainly would not support that
8937435 but look around football and look whats happening and im afraid a club and a manager not wanting a player to go sometimes is not enough
8937436 at the moment i am sat here very relaxed about where we are yes we have got a lot of injuries that happens in football but those players will get over the injuries they will come back into the team and they will perform for the club
8937437 the fans shouldnt be worried i am certainly not and if i was worried i would tell them
8937438 an identification tag inscribed with private fishers details has been found at the site

8937443 a war based not on reason but on passion not on principle but on politics
8937444 i know that an invasion of iraq without a clear rationale and without strong international support will only fan the flames of the middle east and strengthen the recruitment arm of al qaida

8937460 cannibalism and prion disease may have been rampant in ancient humans
8937461 if it does work out well it will probably be a small plus for us
8937462 obviously if it doesnt work out well then the republicans are going to have a problem
8937463 its more of a problem if youre the guy living in the eye of the storm
8937464 our concern is for the lives in the storms potential path
8937465 this is not about politics its about people and doing whats right

8937483 we will launch counter demostration and agitation at the gates of all factories where citu has presence on september 3
8937484 it is now almost three weeks since the bodies of xi zhou and zhen xing yang were discovered since then officers have been working tirelessly to catch their killers
8937485 we have been examining forensic evidence cctv mobile phone and banking records computer and website data i hope that anybody who has information and has yet to come forward will see the new appeal and contact my officers
8937486 the sequence of events of the case would show that the appellant association coai and its members have been enjoying the benefit of the tdsats observation that it expects parties not to proceed further after the matter has come before it
8937487 therefore the authority has not taken any further steps in furtherance of the showcause notices issued to the service providers in response to the said showcause notices
8937488 because of the fact that even the latest congestion report has now become a part of the pending appeal proceedings the authority has been left with no option but to await the final decision of the tdsat as the pending case has effectively tied the hands of the authority from taking any steps for ensuring quality of service
8937489 this moment this election is our chance to keep in the 21st century the american promise alive
8937490 yes we can as he accepted the the democratic presidential nomination

8937495 she should immediately sit for dialogue with the government and place whatever proposal she had to resolve the stalemate
8937496 we want the nano should roll out from the state
8937497 zardari has been advised to stay in a safe place and under the cover of official security
8937498 we condemn the inactivity of the cm and his utter failure in controlling the situation we see a lapse on his part
8937499 due to pressure from his political partners the bjp the government is not acting
8937500 loot and arson are continuing churches are being burnt and people are fleeing to the jungles to save themselves
8937501 they are involved in arson looting burning of property and other such acts
8937502 this is an issue of the state government we have nothing against cbi inquiry
8937503 what is the need of a union minister who cant come to the aid of a state in the time of need
8937504 not only this time during the turmoil at nandigram dasmunshi was instrumental in opposing sending crpf to maintain law and order
8937505 we have doubts whether the government is serious in resolving the issue sincerely in view of the deferring of the fourth round of talks today
8937506 the government seems to be under pressure of separatists and secessionist elements and therefore there are doubts whether it is serious in resolving the issue
8937507 the chief minister is already publicly censured it is a big punishment for a communist leader and a communist so it is enough a person cannot get any punishment twice for the same crime for the party it is over the chapter is closed
8937508 we are going to take this competition very seriously our manager harry redknapp takes every competition we enter very seriously
8937509 there are two vitorias in portugal but the one we are playing are from guimaraes and had a very good season last season finishing third we would have preferred to be at home in the second leg but either way it is going to be fantastic

8937517 he laid out his plan and spoke clearly so that we can understand exactly what he wants to do theres no question he took the time to analyze it and thought of a plan to put forth that will work for us

8937521 the separatist regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia and the russian authorities are cut off from reality
8937522 the world has already become different and russia will not long be able to occupy sovereign georgian territory
8937523 the regimes of abkhazia and south ossetia should think about the fact that if they become part of russia they will be assimilated and in this way they will disappear
8937524 we dont foresee any sanctions decided on by the european council
8937525 soon there will be no north or south ossetia there will be a united alania as part of russia
8937526 we did have lots of contacts with georgia over a long period of time
8937527 georgia found it too hard to hold that line when they were seeing what russia was preparing to do
8937528 two trillion barrels of oil shale in america 1 5x that in tar sands in canada yep not enough oil im convinced

8937536 present estimates of coal reserves which take into account location quality recoverability and transportation issues are based upon methods that have not been updated since their inception in 1974 and much of the input data were compiled in the early 1970s recent programs to assess coal recoverability in limited areas using updated methods indicate that only a small fraction of previously estimated reserves are actually recoverable such findings emphasize the need for a reinvigorated coal reserve assessment program using modern methods and technologies

8937546 i am very grateful to antic because he has confidence in me but im spanish and i feel spanish and i will play with the national team
8937547 i am very happy with the game against denmark because i was on the bench of the european champions and at 17 that is a privilege
8937548 we are continuing to narrow the scope of our mainland u s operations that are most exposed to the credit and mortgage markets by leveraging on our core strengths in puerto rico where we are the undisputed market leader

8937558 it would not be fiscally prudent to take capacity away from core processors with a 100 ish asp to service atom which have a 25 ish asp
8937559 capacity needed to be added and that can only be done so fast as one has to buy equipment install it and set up the appropriate factory lines etc
8937560 this is the user manual that came with a usb drive caddy i bought a little while ago
8937561 im so glad to have it since my previous removable drive wasnt so good with my machine plank no matter how i conjunctioned the hard dish
8937562 i couldnt recall whether i had signed up for gradsouthwest com
8937563 after submitting the forgotten username password form its pretty clear i must have
8937564 i work for a company that runs 65 pubs breweries hotels theaters and music venues in the pacific northwest
8937565 we have endless problems with dell printers throughout the organization and dell insists that the problems are on our end im beginning to suspect otherwise
8937566 i was expecting a little more robustness from this video player application
8937567 but she does most of the kissing with the nice handsome doctors son
8937568 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
8937569 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
8937570 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
8937571 we are out to look if we find the right players we will do it one or two
8937572 however i believe its more interesting for us to focus on our strengths and quality rather than looking outside i know it makes headlines but it doesnt make you win games
8937573 i buy the players i feel strengthen the squad after that i consider the price
8937574 i do the job i think it has to be done considering the resources of the club and considering our ambition and the players we have
8937575 i know the media and supporters sometimes too are happy with big numbers but for me what is most important is big quality sometimes both are linked but not always
8937576 there will be some long difficult trips but we want to cope with it and of course come out of it
8937577 it gives you an edge in the premier league if you qualify early then you are not under stress to give absolutely everything in one important game later in the group
8937578 when i arrived in england owen was a young boy very promising and he looked absolutely fantastic because he was very quick sharp and intelligent in front of goal
8937579 he is not just a goalscorer he can make assists has good link play makes runs owen gets where he needs to be as he reads the game
8937580 new approach came out of the race fine but he was just too strong in the early part of the race
8937581 he was very fresh early and very rusty late and i said afterwards i needed to get him to settle again
8937582 he has started to do that in his work already and i think you will see a different horse next time
8937583 its like everybody i think david moyes evertons manager is just looking as we are for loans
8937584 theres a shortage of money out there in the world at the moment it seems
8937585 although sunderland have signed a few players most clubs have not really been spending like they used to and i think they will be spending less and less
8937586 i can see it getting tighter wages have gone up expenses are higher lots of people involved in businesses are struggling
8937587 and clubs are selling players who not long ago you wouldnt expect them to sell
8937588 they are players you thought they wanted to keep so that they could push on and push on and build
8937589 suddenly it has gone the opposite way and one or two other clubs have come in and taken the opportunity to strengthen
8937590 for me as i keep saying it will be the toughest premier league ever look at the other sides
8937591 sunderland are a possible top 10 team this season stoke have just come up but they will be strong they showed that in beating villa
8937592 but certain clubs will still spend certain owners have mega money
8937593 our owner has been fantastic and given us great backing but he knows hes got to balance the books
8937594 if you buy people youve got to sell others to pay for them thats how it should be really
8937595 at pompey i suppose that in the long term weve also got to finance a new training ground and in time a new stadium as well
8937596 we only hold 20 000 people now weve got to be sensible but we pay good wages here and and if i can get a couple more loans in before the deadline i will
8937597 it would be nice to get a point nice to get three points but its a long season and even tottenham will probably still have no points after going to chelsea on sunday and they wont go down either
8937598 crouch and defoe will get goals no worry but there will be some games we will have to play 4 5 1 away which worked well for us last season
8937599 but how can i buy two international strikers and then drop defoe in the first game at chelsea you can imagine what would be said

8937637 i think most of the fans there are just there to enjoy the experience and uh drink beer i mean is that not true
8937638 i think we have great fans and they love baseball
8937639 but if you go to wrigley its kind of an experience i think a lot of our fans are tourists and theyre in town on summer vacation and they just want to check out wrigley
8937640 i think teams who have deficit should be kicked out of europe
8937641 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
8937642 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled
8937643 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
8937644 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
8937645 but when you look at the numbers involved right now nobody can do that any more
8937646 every single match of this qualification will be very tough
8937647 every team can surprise or make some sensation and every team wants to advance sure
8937648 it is going to be a pleasure for us to play benfica
8937649 they are a big club and have similar fans to napolis so it is going to feel like a derby and a huge party
8937650 we are curious to see how our team which is one of the youngest in italy can cope against a strong experienced team like benfica
8937651 the representatives of benfica were not very happy when the draw was made
8937652 i can understand that because of all the teams they could have got napoli was probably the one they wanted to avoid
8937653 but for us they were all tough opponents and benfica is probably the best we could have got because at least if we do go out it would be to a big club
8937654 it is going to be very hard for us but we are looking forward to it
8937655 udinese have a good team and we have a good team so i would say our chances are 50 50
8937656 obviously we would have preferred to play in udine first but we will have a full house and over 70 000 fans behind us
8937657 we want to get into the second round and have got to draw on all our strength to put udinese out and then we will see how far we can come in this competition
8937658 but when you draw a side like udinese you cannot take anything for granted
8937659 i think for zurich facing milan will be a big motivation
8937660 it will be an intriguing game and there are a lot of milan fans in zurich but our aim is to win
8937661 we will be playing in three competitions this season serie a coppa italia and uefa cup and we intend to win them all
8937662 the important thing is that we enter the field with the right attitude and the right approach to the game
8937663 that will be the case both at home and away

8937678 if you compare the statements of cardinal rigali bishop lori archbishop chaput and archbishop wuerl to cardinal egans the latter has the tone of someone who has
8937679 cardinal egans judgment of nandy pelosis farce about the churchs teaching on abortion is unusually and refreshingly blunt bravo for him
8937680 did i just hear cardinal egan change the abortion debate
8937681 game set and match to the pro life crowd cardinal egan just pulled a reverse of the scopes monkey trials he demonstrated that scientific proof was on the side of the bible but knowing he was speaking to a lot of folks who put no credence in the scriptures he avoided even bringing them into the conversation
8937682 this is like the good old days a new york city cardinal telling a cino catholic in name only she must recant her pro abortion position it reminds me of cardinal john oconnor and geraldine ferraro and mario cuomo well done cardinal egan

8937687 to me this is a challenge when a certain person in the boxing industry hbos larry merchant first mentioned this it stuck in my head yes i am older and bigger and yes he is younger and stronger when freddie roach said manny pacquiao the fighter i trained can beat you it started to become personal to me to me its a challenge because people are talking about manny pacquiao can beat me well we will see on dec 6
8937688 this fight will really be a difficult fight for me but i know some people say it is a very easy fight for oscar but you know what i always do my job in the ring to give a good fight i think i can beat de la hoya i saw his last match and i think i am faster and stronger than him and i am younger also i believe i can beat him in the way that i beat david diaz in my last fight my speed oscar does have a height advantage but i believe i am stronger than him it is going to be a great fight on dec 6

8937753 after that i kept on moving and surviving the round
8937754 hes saying that in this fight hes going to be putting pressure from the beginning from the first round but i believe if he does that hes only got six rounds to do it

8938005 since track forecasts are always subject to large errors at three to five days it is simply impossible at this time to determine exactly where and when gustav will make final landfall

8938052 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
8938053 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
8938054 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
8938055 the bumper to absorb energy to reduce the risk of injury is not the kind of bumper system you would design to help protect the vehicle
8938056 the data that we have really drives the direction and the nature of the standards we develop

8938061 she has a lot of shots and we hope she steps up as a senior heidi is capable of having big games day in and day out and has the ability to carry the team
8938062 shes coming off a big surgery for a hitter but is a hard worker and should be fine lauren is a good layer she passes well plays hard and can make a difference on our team
8938063 its her fourth season as a libero and she is definitely more comfortable back there we passed a lot of balls this spring and she did a nice job last fall katie is a stabilizing point for our team especially in the serve receive aspect
8938064 brett made great improvements from the fall heading into the spring
8938065 she can play good defense and seems to be more of a defensive specialist rather than a libero
8938066 brittany is very familiar with the position because she played it so often during her club ball
8938067 well see how she jumps onto the court as a freshman after dealing with the change of speed from club ball to the collegiate level
8938068 regina is feeling a little more comfortable with the hitters we have and the offense we are running
8938069 she understands what we want to run and she can be a leader on the court regina has two years of experience under her belt and knows when to set her teammates up and when to attack the other team as well
8938070 evan lacks a little bit of experience in setting but she brings a great sense of how to play the game
8938071 we want to see how quickly she develops and see how she progresses evan needs to work on her quick sets
8938072 she has the ability to put the ball in play when needed while also being able to pound the ball for the easy point
8938073 evan has played this position during her club days and has played it extremely well
8938074 shes had three years of being on the floor bethany brings a lot of intelligence to the team and has a wide range of shots her positive attitude helps get teammates involved
8938075 shell find a way to make the big play jessica hits the ball hard and scores points shes learning how to hit the slide shot and if she continues to work on it jessica could be an even bigger asset to our team
8938076 tamia has seen some big teams while playing club ball
8938077 shes playing the best kids that are out there and shes holding her own a blocking middle tamia understands that her first responsibility is to block then attack she is excellent at closing and transitioning off the net
8938078 she can slide and hit quick laura blocks extremely well and does a lot of really good things the last two years she helped her team reach the aau national tournament lauras made the national all tournament team and is just a good solid player
8938079 we love playing up a level because its a great learning tool it also forces us to step up our game if we play at a high level during non conference we will hopefully continue it when we get into our league once in the big south nothing should surprise us because weve gone up against competition that hits the ball harder and runs every type of offense

8938107 cuando se habla de un programa de informaci n pol tica creo que hablamos de un programa de informaci n general un programa que trata de la vida porque todo lo que tenemos en nuestra vida nos lo tiene que resolver la pol tica el salario y la vivienda digna la igualdad de trato la seguridad etc exceptuando el amor que debemos buscarlo nosotros por eso la mirada cr tica es un programa que trata de la pol tica pero que trata tambi n de la vida en todos sus aspectos

8938109 do you think its a valid argument that a john mccain administration would be a four year extension of the bush administration
8938110 sure but i think thats whats going to happen with obama too
8938111 they want more troops in afghanistan they want to send more support to georgia to protect the oil line there neither one says bring home the troops from iraq from the bases you know the bases are going to stay there the embassy as big as the vatican thats going to remain so their foreign policies are exactly the same theyre both very very aggressive with iran so i would say theres no difference

8938127 selection could be used to attack mccain for being disingenuous when he says obama lacks the experience to be commander in chief
8938128 she wouldnt be expected to compete with biden in the vice presidential debate
8938129 attacking her for being inexperienced undoes some of whats been accomplished the last week and bolsters the
8938130 john mccain has spent months trying to scare the american people into believing that barack obama lacks the necessary experience to be president yet in his first executive decision chooses a woman whose experience consists of 2 years as governor of alaska and x years as mayor of a town of less than 9 000 people either john mccain was lying when he stated that obama wasnt ready to be president or else this is just one more of his many changes of heart if the latter the obama campaign appreciates the endorsement
8938131 im not sure i follow petey youre saying that mccain is masterfully capitalizing on obamas inexperience by choosing someone who has a fraction of his experience or demonstrated ability
8938132 theres a large number of americans who wont vote for a black candidate and they wouldnt have voted for a woman candidate either of course mccain can win
8938133 were glad that senator mccain has concluded that decades in washington are not a necessary experience

8938164 this is an important milestone toward securing a future for the sumatran elephant and tiger
8938165 to ensure the commitment is effectively implemented we must redouble our efforts to eliminate poaching and illegal settlements within this special forest
8938166 tesso nilo is still under serious threat from illegal activities but if we can protect the forests there it will give some of sumatras most endangered wildlife the breathing room they need to survive
8938167 and while we greatly appreciate this precedent for more protection from the indonesian government there are other areas on sumatra that need safeguarding for the sake of its wildlife its threatened indigenous peoples and to reduce the climate impacts of clearing

8938172 the evidence from basic research studies is compelling and merits further evaluation in a rigorous human clinical trial
8938173 while most current alzheimers disease therapies focus on the various symptoms of cognitive impairment this trial is testing whether we can modify actual progression of the disease itself by targeting the interaction between amyloid beta and an important receptor in the brain
8938174 progress in treating and preventing alzheimers would just not be possible without the dedication of the patients and families who volunteer for clinical trials
8938175 in addition to monitoring disease progression through cognitive tests we will examine various biological markers of the disease
8938176 these include the degree of atrophy or shrinkage of the brain as measured by magnetic resonance imaging the extent of amyloid buildup in the brain assessed by positron emission topography imaging and levels of amyloid beta and other proteins in blood and spinal fluid
8938177 we could not accurately forecast river flows and water levels without the data and support we receive from the usgs

8938201 never seen a time when washington has watched so many people get knocked down without doing anything to help them get back up

8938203 we never lost cabin pressure so we didnt have to use our oxygen masks by the time we got on the ground the crack on the front of the planes window was huge and getting bigger by the second

8938207 caregivers have similar cortisol levels as controls their cells seem to be hearing less of this signal in other words something goes awry in caregivers white blood cells so they are not able to receive the signal from cortisol that tells them to shut down inflammation
8938208 because people have traditionally thought that higher cortisol is the reason that stress contributes to disease but this work shows that at least in caregivers its actually the opposite theres too little cortisol signal being heard by the cells rather than too much
8938209 we dont know how to account for the resilience of some stressed people exposed to severe sustained stress or the vulnerability of some people to relatively mild stress
8938210 the better that we understand the underlying molecular mechanisms that link stress to illness the more likely we are to make progress in answering these important questions

8938246 conclusion this needed to be a serious speech and it was im still not sure about the doric columns but hes managed to be convincing despite the overbearing backdrop one of the features of the speech was the frequent reference to the future hes not saying mccains too old for the job at least not in so many words but the obama camp know that americans are worried about mccains age and ever so subtly they are making an allusion to it

8938262 creare una alitalia nuova una compagnia aerea pi efficiente finanziariamente in equilibrio tecnologicamente avanzata
8938263 almeno allinizio ci sono da fare dei sacrifici perch le passate gestioni dellalitalia non possono essere cancellate con un colpo di bacchetta magica
8938264 si deve procedere a un ridimensionamento del personale il cui numero attuale non compatibile con una gestione economicamente sana dellazienda
8938265 il personale in eccedenza si trover in una situazione su cui riteniamo di dovere noi intervenire non sar certo abbandonato perch non giusto che siano i singoli a pagare gli errori delle gestioni del passato e non saranno abbandonati neppure i piccoli risparmiatori che in alitalia hanno creduto investendo in titoli azionari ed obbligazionari della compagnia
8938266 se la nuova compagnia aerea dovesse ritenere utile allearsi con una compagnia straniera questa potr entrare solo come socio di minoranza
8938267 in condizioni meno favorevoli per litalia per i lavoratori i consumatori e gli azionisti

8938277 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile

8938289 the missing persons campaign has been a great success for tracesmart and our reunited customers lisa and her fathers story is another example of just how easy it can be to track down a lost loved one using our search facility the media has been keen to feature our reunion stories and hopefully it will encourage more people to start searching for their long lost friends or relatives

8938345 there is nothing more important to any campaign than a strong team of volunteers to help spread a positive message for oklahomas future in recent years a lot has changed about how campaigns are run however im confident theres one thing that will never change people will always be the single greatest key to victory without strong grassroots support no candidate can have a truly winning team i am humbled by the number of new supporters recruited at the university of oklahoma college students are the lifeblood of a fall campaigns volunteer force and im excited about what well accomplish together in the coming months
8938346 congressman cole is a tremendous leader for oklahoma and a tireless campaigner were honored to be sharing the ballot with him and my good friend john mccain this november
8938347 i am excited to see that our joint effort with senator inhofe has led to the recruitment of so many young voters clearly ours is a message that the young voters of oklahoma believe in it is imperative that oklahomans return jim inhofe to the united states senate and that we have an infrastructure that can support senator john mccain in his bid for the presidency
8938348 i am proud to move our campaigns forward with the help of these wonderful volunteers there is a lot of talk right now about the strength of the youth movement empowering senator barack obama and the dark times ahead of the republican party in november if our success today at the university of oklahoma is any indication of the interest young voters have in senator john mccain senator jim inhofe and my own campaign then i believe we have a great opportunity to take our conservative message back to washington d c in november
8938349 it was teamwork that brought the two campaigns together to recruit and share volunteers and it was spirited competition among staffers and ou college republicans at the recruiting booth that drove up the numbers of those interested in participating
8938350 what i do remember very well is the flip side when prices were very low for a very long period of time
8938351 i dont know of any well in the country that would be shut in right now
8938352 the prices that we are seeing today definitely give us an incentive to spend some money on those wells to get them back into production
8938353 but we want to see if we can put some of them back on line even when they just produce a barrel or two or three a day our landowners are excited as well looking forward to more royalty payments
8938354 but they are affordable now given the price of oil and the enhanced production of course contributes a considerable amount of additional oil to the country
8938355 these wells provide the country with a very secure strategically significant source of crude oil
8938356 because it is here producing 24 hours a day seven days a week
8938357 and they support a lot of jobs both directly and indirectly
8938358 but we also recognize that record high prices are not necessarily good for the industry because it is difficult for people to realize or understand the advantages inhofe participates in ribbon cutting ceremony for new elgin facility
8938359 based on everything ive heard and what ive heard today our efforts are paying off to get 169 funded
8938360 our goal was to get the federal government to recognize our project and allocate funding for it on any level
8938361 we know that the major funding for it is going to come in the reauthorization act thats where we focused
8938362 what would be helpful to me is work with him and work with these odot commissioners so that when were brought in we know that we have the state support i think you might be very pleased with what happens

8938414 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited

8938524 the loose flowy fabrics fit any body shape whether you are a size 8 or a size 16

8938552 marbleheads involvement in covert operations was significant and her losses profound nearly 600 marblehead men served in the famous glovers regiment

8938554 sept 2 is the anniversary of the commissioning of the famous privateer ship the hannah it is fitting to recognize the sacrifices of so many marblehead soldiers sailors and families during the difficult war that devastated our towns economy and citizens but resulted in americas independence so we have been offering this tour on the labor day holiday each year since 2000

8938579 we had two choices to try to do something or to do nothing
8938580 we had a set of standards it was a crime to let them sit on a shelf

8938588 we have serious grounds to think that there were u s citizens right in the combat zone
8938589 and if thats so if that is confirmed its very bad its very dangerous
8938590 we try and keep our industry out of politics and into marketing opportunities but sometimes its very difficult to separate the two
8938591 the american side in fact armed and trained the georgian army
8938592 why hold years of difficult talks and seek complex compromise solutions in interethnic conflicts its easier to arm one side and push it into the murder of the other side and its over
8938593 it seems like an easy solution in reality it turns out that its not always so
8938594 if my guesses are confirmed then that raises the suspicion that somebody in the united states purposefully created this conflict with the aim of aggravating the situation and creating an advantage for one of the candidates in the battle for the post of u s president
8938595 it also sounds like his defense officials who said they believe this to be true are giving him really bad advice
8938596 to suggest that the united states orchestrated this on behalf of a political candidate just sounds not rational
8938597 the participants underscore the need for respect of the historical and cultural traditions of each country and each people and for efforts aimed at preserving the unity of the state and its

8938602 it looks like hurricane katrina isnt the only things fema has screwed up
8938603 this one size fits all approach is unfair to smaller communities who by nature cannot generate the money needed to recover from the storm without passing significantly more costs onto the homeowners and business owners already suffering from the loss of personal property and damage to their homes and businesses
8938604 while 3 5 million of damage may not be a lot of money to new york city and other larger cites or municipalities it seems to be an insurmountable amount for the city of rensselaer and its taxpayers

8938640 the lower red line indicates the level at which the sustainability of the lake is threatened we are certainly very alarmed by the authorities willingness to go to the black line this development could well be irreversible
8938641 we used to say even a few years ago that one place where you couldnt go wrong fishing was kinneret hebrew name for the sea of galilee but now it is getting very very hard because the stocks are so low
8938642 six months before the acceptance of the united nations resolution on a cease fire the regime was planning the execution of political prisoners
8938643 were visiting prisons and said that by the order of ayatollah khomeini an amnesty committee has been established and members were asking the prisoners questions i remember they came to our prison in gohardasht where i was a prisoner they asked some questions and told us that the imams amnesty committee had decided that there should not be any political prisoners left in the prisons at that time we had a lot of optimism and we thought that by the end of war they would release the political prisoners
8938644 the pretext for the execution of religious and non religious political prisoners in the summer of 1988 was quite different
8938645 those with religious affiliations who were mostly from the mujahedin e khalqh pmoi organization went to the gallows as mohareb combatants with god whereas the leftists were executed as apostates i was in the gohardasht prison when the death commission came there and commission member mr nayeris question was are you a muslim or a marxist the destiny of those who answered they are marxist was predetermined
8938646 in the contemporary history of iran the executions of 88 are considered among the most important cases of human rights abuses
8938647 based on international human rights laws the vast scale of those executions and the way that they were carried out unlawfully place those systematic killings in the category of crimes against humanity the iranian government never openly confessed to these executions so the true scope the number of executed prisoners and the precise place of their burial are unknown
8938648 i have to know what happened we want the truth
8938649 those who were condemned to prison terms should not have been executed based on what the clergy says why did they kill them what did they want from them what did they ask what did they mention in their wills what conditions did they endure these are the things that i think should be cleared one day and until then the wounds in our hearts will remain always fresh

8938681 the government of moldova does not think at this moment that international recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia will become a factor stabilizing the situation
8938682 as in the case of kosovo such methods only reduce the responsibility of the sides in the conflict for the search of a compromise between them

8938687 the next president of the united states should sign an executive order requiring the census bureau to cease and desist from describing any american even illegal aliens as uninsured
8938688 nearly 18 million of the uninsured lived in households with annual incomes above 50 000 and could likely afford health insurance
8938689 up to 14 million uninsured adults and children qualified for government programs in 2004 but had not enrolled
8938690 in theory therefore about 32 million people or 70 percent of the uninsured could easily obtain coverage but have chosen to forgo insurance explains herrick that means that about 95 percent of united states residents either have health coverage or access to it the remaining 5 percent live in households that earn less than 50 000 annually this group does not qualify for medicaid and arguably earns too little to easily afford expensive family plans costing more than 12 106 per year a uniform tax credit would go a long way toward helping this group afford coverage

8938697 we should not be looking for ways to punish russia
8938698 the most important thing is to have a unified eu position as the conflict is obviously not going to end soon
8938699 the 0 4 percent month over month contraction in real u s consumption in july following a 0 1 percent decline the month before means that consumption is almost sure to contract over the third quarter as a whole moreover with consumer confidence still very low unemployment rising and the boost from the tax rebates behind us we could see a substantial decline in personal spending
8938700 overall there are a lot of negatives for consumption right now and precious few positives with consumption falling we suspect that the overall economy will contract too even after allowing for the strength of exports
8938701 july personal income fell 0 7 percent much weaker than the consensus 0 2 percent while nominal spending rose 0 2 percent in line with consensus with the headline deflator up 0 6 percent thanks to the final leap in energy prices real spending fell the second straight decline the core deflator rose 0 3 percent as expected real spending was weakest in durable goods no surprise there as this sector includes cars and sales plunged in july total real spending on durables fell 1 6 percent with non durables down a hefty 0 9 percent and services unchanged with real spending down in june too by 0 1 percent the starting point for the third quarter is very soft with the tax refund effect on spending now more or less over we think the worst is yet to come for consumers and we expect an outright decline in real third quarter consumption
8938702 the effects of the tax rebates rolling on and off are relatively large wage income is in total still growing at a moderate pace it is no match for strong inflation but if we can manage to keep gasoline and food prices on a more level basis then you will not see a very sharp drop in consumption but its still kind of challenging
8938703 the perfect storm continues to hurtle onshore given wages fuel and food costs the woes of tighter credit and negative wealth effects there is not that much that the market did not know here but it is a reminder that the third quarter and particularly the fourth quarter will look a good deal worse than the second that was a nice tax induced brief look in the rear view mirror
8938704 im trying to figure it out its based on a month versus month everybody was getting those rebate checks compared to last month when you didnt get that extra external check you had a big decline
8938705 we expect that kind of stuff when you go to bonus season in december and january always shows a big decline i think because its not seasonally adjusted thats what caused the big negative
8938706 they dont come out and tell you why but that seems like the most logical explanation for that big of a drop is that the checks basically ran out
8938707 overall u s consumer spending is still there even though it slowed the conclusion from this report i think is that the u s economy is nearing a bottom it is making a recovery and that should support the dollar going forward but the reason we didnt have a dollar reaction is that there arent that many people on board because of the long holiday weekend
8938708 what does russia want to become two russian empires have already collapsed one in 1917 which led to millions of victims and the other one in 1990 does russia want to create another empire so it collapses again
8938709 we need to think not about a sphere of influence but about working together to make peoples lives better combatting terrorism and other senseless evil and destruction i think this is a much more productive path for russian and a much better alternative to trying to undo the bloodless dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 and restore something like the soviet union now
8938710 in spite of everything that has happened to our country in recent years despite being picked on and slandered despite the war that we had and other internal troubles our country has made the right decision and that is important

8938834 i dont know what kind of lives john mccain thinks that celebrities lead but this has been mine

8938847 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
8938848 you know this is really very boring but somehow you arent bored
8938849 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives this is going to be a more workmanlike speech
8938850 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
8938851 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
8938852 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
8938853 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
8938854 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
8938855 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
8938856 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
8938857 who are open to doing something on the production side
8938858 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
8938859 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
8938860 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
8938861 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
8938862 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
8938863 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
8938864 the part that i didnt expect was once it was posted online what it would achieve virally
8938865 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
8938866 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
8938867 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
8938868 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
8938869 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
8938870 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
8938871 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
8938872 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
8938873 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
8938874 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
8938875 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
8938876 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
8938877 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
8938878 why didnt you guys just try to make it to the bed you already made it to the room
8938879 whether you would call that a beating i dont know he could have hit his head on something or something could have hit him in the head

8938888 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
8938889 americans never elect policy proposals they choose the men behind them what barack obama achieved thursday night was something unimaginable in martin luther kings day or even in the 1990s in a football stadium at the foot of the rockies this product of a marriage between kenya and kansas rewrote the history of a nation that has been struggling for three centuries with the legacy of slavery and segregation obamas gift is that he makes it all seem natural that his rise to the heights of a presidential nomination was an inevitable consequence of 21st century america the fireworks that were going off over mile high stadium were in truth more than equaled by the glow in the hearts of democrats who leave denver alight with hope
8938890 didnt king become more radical in the course of his career in the period leading up to his assassination it was largely because of the fact that he moved from civil rights to human rights one of kings famous quotes after desegregation laws had been passed was that he began to find out that it mattered little if african americans he said negroes of course have the right to eat at the counter if they dont have a dollar to spend at the lunch counter
8938891 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
8938892 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
8938893 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
8938894 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
8938895 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
8938896 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
8938897 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
8938898 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
8938899 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
8938900 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
8938901 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
8938902 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
8938903 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
8938904 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
8938905 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
8938906 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
8938907 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
8938908 we cant definitively say its not listeriosis but certainly everything looks as though its not
8938909 we know they had some of the recalled product at the camp but that doesnt mean thats what caused this
8938910 our heritage is vital and we must not allow it to be forgotten
8938911 it has been a bumpy ride at times but its in the right direction
8938912 i had a few goals in mind when i started this one was to celebrate life one year later and to celebrate the community and thank them for their support
8938913 we also want to raise awareness for the one match network and to raise some funds for the blanket warmers
8938914 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
8938915 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
8938916 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
8938917 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
8938918 every time with the issue of the mmr vaccine we had one person andrew wakefield brought on board to oppose the rest of the scientific community as if it was one on one

8938928 is this what we want to represent the first district of kentucky
8938929 by knowing this minimum galaxy mass we can better understand how dark matter behaves which is essential to one day learning how our universe and life as we know it came to be
8938930 what we have discovered is more extreme and akin to saying that all metro areas even those that are barely visible at night to the aliens have a population of about 10 million
8938931 we are excited because these galaxies are virtually invisible yet contain a tremendous amount of dark matter
8938932 this helps us better understand the particle that makes up dark matter and it teaches us something about how galaxies form in the universe
8938933 if something will happen with this boy thats fine but if not please take my feelings away

8938937 this is me but i dont like me because i do this
8938938 wheat yield potential is greatest in south central kansas when planted between sept 25 and oct 20 and in southeast kansas when planted between oct 5 and oct 25
8938939 hessian fly aphids and wheat curl mites are more likely to invade earlier planted wheat causing damage and vectoring viral diseases such as barley yellow dwarf and wheat streak mosaic
8938940 if planting early the best management practice against insects and disease is to select resistant varieties with good yield potential
8938941 systemic insecticide seed treatments may provide a benefit against some insects and the viral diseases they vector however these can be costly and are an added expense if insects are not present
8938942 earlier this year we undertook the largest expansion initiative in the companys history simultaneously launching 22 new cities
8938943 the successful launch of those cities has allowed us to accelerate our geographical development beyond the original plans we had previously announced expanding by 10 cities in the 4th quarter of 2008 but we are now fortunate to include 3 additional cites
8938944 the wimax technology continues to perform well and we are pleased with the subscriber growth
8938945 with this announcement we conclude our geographic deployments for 2008 we are now finalizing plans with our investors for an exciting 2009 that further leverages our first to market leadership in wireless broadband services

8938958 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

8938969 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
8938970 that this is a vaguely worded piece of legislation that seeks to criminalise peoples thoughts
8938971 two bags of ballbearings described as the shrapnel of choice for suicide bombers were found in one of his pockets
8938972 while there is undeniably a terror threat to britain the government has been more than eager to exaggerate the extent of the danger
8938973 of course members of the government who lied to us in order to shore up support for an illegal invasion of a sovereign country that posed no threat to us could never be thought of as terrorists
8938974 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
8938975 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
8938976 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
8938977 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
8938978 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
8938979 during the august recess i have been from one end of georgia to the other and the number one issue i hear about continues to be the high cost of fuel
8938980 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
8938981 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table

8938990 we have doubts whether the government is serious in resolving the issue sincerely in view of the deferring of the fourth round of talks today

8939021 the government of moldova does not think at this moment that international recognition of abkhazia and south ossetia will become a factor stabilising the situation
8939022 as in the case of kosovo such methods only reduce the responsibility of the sides in the conflict for the search of a compromise between them

8939035 the vehicle was traveling north on 1862 on the west end of the county when it missed the intersection on fm 616
8939036 the vehicle proceeded across the ditch and landed up on the railroad tracks
8939037 as he got to the 1862 intersection he noticed the car up on the tracks and having just passed the train he knew trouble was coming fast
8939038 at the same time the railroad engineer had observed the vehicle on the tracks and went into emergency breaking and started to blow the whistle
8939039 the injured man said he could not get out so kopaz reached in grabbed him and helped him out
8939040 he immediately stumbled so the trooper reached in and put his arms under him and drug him off the railroad tracks
8939041 they went about 18 feet he had to lay him down on the ground he covered him up with his body just as the train hit the car it was that close the car was taken 1 500 feet down the tracks before it came to a stop
8939042 these individuals come from very small departments they are none the less extremely valuable to the law enforcement program in matagorda county
8939043 as you all know this will be my last 100 club award banquet to serve in this capacity and i want to tell everyone that it has been an extreme honor
8939044 one of the greatest honors i think that can be bestowed upon an individual in addition to being a peace officer is serving as a texas sheriff
8939045 the reason i am so proud is because i have had the opportunity to work with this group of men and women of the matagorda county sheriffs office
8939046 i cant say enough about them it has been my distinct honor to work with each of you
8939047 the reason why i chose this person is because every time i needed help at the crisis center i could always pick the phone up and call this person and he would always call me right back and help me with whatever i needed help with

8939100 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
8939101 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
8939102 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
8939103 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
8939104 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
8939105 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
8939106 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
8939107 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
8939108 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
8939109 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
8939110 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
8939111 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
8939112 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
8939113 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
8939114 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
8939115 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
8939116 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
8939117 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
8939118 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
8939119 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
8939120 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
8939121 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
8939122 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
8939123 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
8939124 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
8939125 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
8939126 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
8939127 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
8939128 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
8939129 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
8939130 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
8939131 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
8939132 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
8939133 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
8939134 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
8939135 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
8939136 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
8939137 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
8939138 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
8939139 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
8939140 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
8939141 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
8939142 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
8939143 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
8939144 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
8939145 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
8939146 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
8939147 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
8939148 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
8939149 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
8939150 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
8939151 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
8939152 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
8939153 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
8939154 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
8939155 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
8939156 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
8939157 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
8939158 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
8939159 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
8939160 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
8939161 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
8939162 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
8939163 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
8939164 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
8939165 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
8939166 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
8939167 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

8939180 it is not clear whether any order to disperse was given no legal observer sic witness or arrestee on the scene weve debriefed heard any order to disperse
8939181 numerous persons including legal observers asked to be able to leave the blockaded area and were refused
8939182 after the arrests attorneys from the peoples law project and the aclu arrived at the temporary arrestee processing site to conduct confidential attorney client consultations
8939183 the city refused to provide any access to allow these persons to meet with attorneys
8939184 i personally saw one such arrestee later at the city and county building i saw her marched from the elevator to the courtroom in bare feet and leg shackles i saw her appear in bare feet and leg shackles
8939185 some arrestees who could not make their own bond spent 6 7 8 or more hours waiting at taps before being transferred to court
8939186 the only access we were given to those clients was to whisper
8939187 attorneys were at the court from 11 pm on the night of aug 25 2008 and were staying until each and every arrestee came to the city and county building

8939290 ive seen a number of players at national tournaments who came in baked thats stoned for the uninformed purely so they could play better in most cases they did although obviously they couldnt just pull out another joint midway through
8939291 these events are like a holiday for most of the people competing and if they do bring some drugs along which happens frequently then they want to save it for the big night out with their mates rather than waste it for the chance to win a single game
8939292 they all know that you cant rely on anything other than a lot of skill and solid teamwork to win a major event drugs wont help you there
8939293 gamers can take all the drugs they like as long as its not happening in the actual tournament area
8939294 nobody has the budget to bring in any form of anti doping agency let alone keep it afloat or professional enough to adhere to standards that would make it reliable
8939295 drugs just arent on the radar because there are so many other pressing issues to deal with
8939296 if one major event goes bust it could spell doom for all the others most major events rely on sponsors for capital and until these events become self sustainable for the most part youre not going to see people getting tested for dope or speed

8939338 the joy shown by the people every day not only at the ruin of the concubine but at the hope of princess marys restoration is inconceivable but as yet the king shows no great disposition towards the latter indeed he has twice shown himself obstinate when spoken to on the subject by his council i hear that even before the arrest of the concubine the king speaking with mistress jane seymour of their future marriage the latter suggested that the princess should be replaced in her former position and the king told her she was a fool and ought to solicit the advancement of the children they would have between them and not any others she replied that in asking for the restoration of the princess she was seeking the rest and tranquility of the king herself her future children and the whole realm for without that neither your majesty nor this people would ever be content i will endeavor by all means to make her continue in this vein i hope also to go and speak with the king within three days and with members of the council in general i think the concubines little bastard elizabeth will be excluded from the succession and that the king will get himself requested by parliament to marry to cover the affection he has for the said seymour he has lodged her seven miles away in the house of a grand esquire and says publicly that he has no desire in the world to marry again unless he is constrained by his subjects to do so several have already told me and sent to say that if it cost them their lives when parliament meets they will urge the cause of the princess to the utmost the very evening the concubine was brought to the tower of london when the duke of richmond went to say goodnight to his father and ask his blessing after the english custom the king began to weep saying that he and his sister meaning the princess were greatly bound to god for having escaped the hands of that accursed whore who had determined to poison them from which it is clear that the king knew something about it master norris the kings chief butler master weston who used to lie with the king master brereton gentleman of the chamber and the groom of whom i wrote to your majesty by my man were all condemned as traitors only the groom confessed that he had been three times with the said whore and concubine the others were condemned upon presumption and certain indications without valid proof or confession the concubine and her brother were condemned for treason by all the principal lords of england and the duke of norfolk pronounced sentence i am told the earl of wiltshire was quite as ready to assist at the judgement as he had done at the condemnation of the other four neither the whore nor her brother was brought to westminster like the other criminals they were condemned within the tower of london but the thing was not done secretly for there were more than 2 000 persons present what she was principally charged with was having cohabited with her brother and other accomplices that there was a promise between her and norris to marry after the kings death which it thus appeared they hoped for and that she had received and given to norris certain medals which might be interpreted to mean that she had poisoned the late queen and intrigued to do the same to the princess these things she totally denied and gave to each a plausible answer yet she confessed she had given money to weston as she had often done to other young gentlemen she was also charged and her brother likewise with having laughed at the king and his dress and that she showed in various ways she did not love the king but was tired of him her brother was charged with having cohabited with her by presumption because he had once been found a long time with her and with certain other little follies to all he replied so well that several of those present wagered 10 to 1 that he would be acquitted especially as no witnesses were produced against either him or her as it is usual to do particularly when the accused denies the charge i must not omit that among other things charged against him as a crime was that his sister had told his wife that the king was impotent this he was not openly charged with but it was shown him in writing with a warning not to repeat it but he immediately declared the matter in great contempt of cromwell and some others saying he would not in this point arouse any suspicion which might prejudice the kings issue he was also charged with having spread reports which called in question whether his sisters daughter was the kings child to which he made no reply they were judged separately and did not see each other the concubine was condemned first and having heard the sentence which was to be burnt or beheaded at the kings pleasure she preserved her composure saying that she held herself ready to greet death and that what she regretted most was that the above persons who were innocent and loyal to the king were to die for her she only asked a short time for confession her brother after his condemnation said that since he must die he would no longer maintain his innocence but confessed that he had deserved death he only begged the king that his debts which he recounted might be paid out of his goods although everybody rejoices at the execution of the whore there are some who murmur at the mode of procedure against her and the others and people speak variously of the king and it will not pacify the world when it is known what has passed and is passing between him and jane seymour already it sounds ill in the ears of the people that the king having received such ignominy has shown himself more glad than ever since the arrest of the whore for he has been going about banqueting with ladies sometimes remaining after midnight and returning by the river most of the time he was accompanied by various musical instruments and on the other hand by the singers of his chamber which many interpret as showing his delight at getting rid of a thin old and wicked fool with hope of change which is a thing especially agreeable to this king he supped lately with several ladies in the house of the bishop of carlisle and showed an extravagant joy as the said bishop came to tell me next morning who reported moreover that the king had said to him among other things that he had long expected the issue of these affairs and that thereupon he had before composed a tragedy which he carried with him and so saying the king drew from his bosom a little book written in his own hand but the bishop did not read the contents it may have been certain ballads that the king had composed at which the whore and her brother laughed as foolish things which was objected to them as a great crime three days after the concubines imprisonment the princess was removed and was honourably accompanied both by the servants of the little bastard and by several gentlemen who came of their own accord many of her old servants and maids at this news went to her and although her governess allowed them to remain she was warned by me not to accept or retain anyone but those given her by the king her father what i most fear as regards her is that when the king is asked by parliament to restore her to her rights he will refuse his consent unless the princess first swears to the statutes invalidating the first marriage and the popes authority to this i think she will not easily yield although i should advise her to acquiesce in everything as far as she can without prejudice to her conscience

8939347 the biomedical engineering building is a magnificent new home for our faculty who are investigating scientific engineering and medical challenges
8939348 it is the place where students will become the next generation to transform our world through innovation and discovery by opening this building we begin a new chapter for our university and for the future of scientific and technological research
8939349 we will see breakthroughs by these researchers in medical imaging nerve regeneration cancer detection and treatment drug synthesis and delivery and countless other areas
8939350 the building will also host work in pharmacy and natural sciences to provide interdisciplinary strength to these programs we have one of the best biomedical engineering faculties in the country and now these talented people will be able to work in one of the finest facilities devoted to biomedical teaching and research
8939351 our people undergraduates graduates and faculty are absolutely superior in their qualifications
8939352 so the building is designed to be a top class environment for these people to thrive in this department is and will continue to produce highly qualified student graduates as employees and the ideas that will drive innovations for the bio tech industry
8939353 focusing on the next generation of consoles would allow the machines to be built from the ground up to use less power while providing an even better experience
8939354 because of the fuel prices they are doing everything with their horses
8939355 i have been around them all my life ever since i was big enough to walk they were all my dad farmed with they were all he had
8939356 the expenses of running a farm are quite high with the fertilizer and the feed and everything else we just couldnt afford the diesel prices we have to try to cut back as much as possible
8939357 we have been on rides with them weve done weddings weve been in parades with them we just enjoy them
8939358 even if diesel prices go back down in the future hell keep working the horses its his passion hes one with the horses
8939359 it is paradise to us before this we had just one acre on brickyard road so this has been a dream for both of us
8939360 its a healthy way of life youre outside i love the outdoors and youre in tune with nature
8939361 with all of the high tech things today the world is changing so fast we still think this is where its at i wouldnt have it any other way
8939362 they prove that there are still people willing to go back to the hard work of it
8939363 its such a contrast with todays time when everyone is so busy and wrapped up that we dont know what would i do if it got to the point where i couldnt afford to drive the carpers know what to do theyve gone back to the earth
8939364 i dont know how much we save doing it this way but its a lot as high as diesel is and the horses give us our own natural fertilizer too
8939365 if something were to happen to this world a lot of people would have trouble surviving
8939366 i believe that the people who do work like we do and the amish they would survive
8939367 with the diesel and fertilizer prices i think theyre trying to drive small farms out of business but we keep plugging along it might get us one of these days but right now no
8939368 well so and so said that mr candidate did this oh my god can you believe that

8939390 its been a very challenging time so its very encouraging for an airline to be showing the confidence they are
8939391 this is a down payment on our more than half a billion dollar plan to get the basics right in literacy and numeracy right across australian schooling
8939392 i welcome the approach of the australian government to focus on teacher quality on better reporting to parents and on needs based funding
8939393 i will be working very closely with the deputy prime minister on implementing these reforms and in fact i believe that we are already well down the track in tasmania in their implementation
8939394 if you measure and identify where additional assistance is required then you can make a difference
8939395 on monday mornings he and i often said goodbye by making love
8939396 but one day all of a sudden it just happened i knew that something was wrong because i didnt hear anything from him just nothing

8939398 if paris hilton thinks my butt looks gross i really dont care at least i have a butt
8939399 they invite the best from each camp and then its up to the girls and their families whether they will attend or not

8939404 as long as we raise the money we are going to go on this trip
8939405 i am very proud of their presentation at the camp
8939406 i think they were so successful because of their experience they have been doing this since middle school
8939407 they know they were capable and they got to see what the real thing is all about watching the camp instructors they saw the degree of difficulty that professionalism takes they watched the intensity and saw how much dedication and hard work it really takes
8939408 cortney fields is the newbie on the team and she worked extremely hard for her invitation
8939409 the other four earned theirs fairly early so she really wanted to go with them she put in a lot of extra time and earned her invitation during the very last routine
8939410 when they got invited they looked at me and said were going
8939411 theyre really working hard and if they can keep on pace and get the community spirit involved i think they will do it
8939412 me gustar a ganar las tres grandes si no es ahora no pasa nada tengo 25 a os
8939413 en principio la baza a jugar es la m a pero tambi n hay otros dos corredores que nos van a dar una tranquilidad enorme el equipo es inteligente y aunque piensa en m tambi n tiene otros dos corredores en los que tiene confianza y que van a aprovechar sus oportunidades
8939414 cada uno intenta quitarse la presi n de la manera que puede
8939415 valverde s lo tuvo un d a malo en el tour y ya fue 2 hace un par de a os incluso kloden o leipheimer si no formaran parte de mi equipo ser an favoritos y tampoco se puede descartar a cunego que ya ha conseguido ganar un giro
8939416 si me ganan no pasa nada el ciclismo no son matem ticas que me haya entrenado para ganar no significa que vaya a ganar
8939417 con 25 a os ya tengo un tour y un giro y si no gano este a o la vuelta no pasa nada me quedan muchos a os por delante para conseguirla
8939418 es un recorrido bueno para la televisi n pero para los ciclistas no tanto ganar el equipo que m s arriesgue nosotros est claro que no vamos a arriesgar
8939419 el seleccionador cuenta conmigo y si termino en buen momento ir y de cara a la contrarreloj intentar ir a conseguir medalla
8939420 el primer d a de monta a se ver si puedo disputar o no
8939421 one who experiences a past of boy scouting never quite gets over the thrill and excitement of those days gone by in preparation for adult life
8939422 it has been one of the most enjoyable work of my life i sure know what it means to work with the boys and i am sure they enjoyed every minute of it also
8939423 i think they said it was because it would be easier for an adult to complete the rank and do the work but thats not so
8939424 my dad he did everything we did he had to follow us boys over every mountain and through every creek we could find in those days he showed us by example
8939425 i liked swimming and being in the river we always enjoyed hiking and camping and all the things scouts do
8939426 really i think i learned a lot of the things i learned in the bible too treat each other with respect do unto others as you would have them do unto you
8939427 he said he had never had an eagle scout stand before his bench
8939428 that tells you something about the quality of people that become eagle scouts
8939429 i firmly believe that our boy scouting experiences and training had much to do with where our family is today our father took the much appreciated time to spend with his boys each sumer as well as throughout the year both parents kept us in church where they were our youth leaders and taught us everything by example they showed us the way
8939430 weve all had a good christian life all the girls we dated were without question good christian girls and its just been a good life
8939431 which ear hath not heard nor eye seen neither have entered into the heart of man
8939432 was so much effort made to capture such a venerable man
8939433 what harm is there in saying lord caesar and in sacrificing with the other ceremonies observed on such occasions and so make sure of safety
8939434 swear by the fortune of caesar repent and say away with the atheists
8939435 swear and i will set thee at liberty reproach christ
8939436 eighty and six years have i served him and he never did me any injury how then can i blaspheme my king and my saviour
8939437 since thou art vainly urgent that as thou sayest i should swear by the fortune of caesar and pretendest not to know who and what i am hear me declare with boldness i am a christian and if you wish to learn what the doctrines of christianity are appoint me a day and thou shalt hear them
8939438 to thee i have thought it right to offer an account of my faith for we are taught to give all due honour which entails no injury upon ourselves to the powers and authorities which are ordained of god comp romans 13 1 7 titus 3 1 but as for these i do not deem them worthy of receiving any account from me
8939439 i have wild beasts at hand to these will i cast thee except thou repent
8939440 call them then for we are not accustomed to repent of what is good in order to adopt that which is evil and it is well for me to be changed from what is evil to what is righteous
8939441 i will cause thee to be consumed by fire seeing thou despisest the wild beasts if thou wilt not repent
8939442 thou threatenest me with fire which burneth for an hour and after a little is extinguished but art ignorant of the fire of the coming judgment and of eternal punishment reserved for the ungodly but why tarriest thou bring forth what thou wilt
8939443 this is the teacher of asia the father of the christians and the overthrower of our gods he who has been teaching many not to sacrifice or to worship the gods
8939444 leave me as i am for he that giveth me strength to endure the fire will also enable me without your securing me by nails to remain without moving in the pile
8939445 o lord god almighty the father of thy beloved and blessed son jesus christ by whom we have received the knowledge of thee the god of angels and powers and of every creature and of the whole race of the righteous who live before thee i give thee thanks that thou hast counted me worthy of this day and this hour that i should have a part in the number of thy martyrs in the cup comp matthew 20 22 matthew 26 39 mark 10 38 of thy christ to the resurrection of eternal life both of soul and body through the incorruption imparted by the holy ghost among whom may i be accepted this day before thee as a fat and acceptable sacrifice according as thou the ever truthful god hast fore ordained hast revealed beforehand to me and now hast fulfilled wherefore also i praise thee for all things i bless thee i glorify thee along with the everlasting and heavenly jesus christ thy beloved son with whom to thee and the holy ghost be glory both now and to all coming ages amen

8939500 the bottom line is that people can get a lot for their money for 400 000
8939501 nassau is a bit pricier but as you go east you will get more house for less money
8939502 some areas have always been more in demand and expensive like massapequa and new hyde park where 400 000 would be on the lower end of the price range
8939503 in suffolk the price differences are less drastic in general in nassau county the town will determine your price areas like the north shore are more expensive and areas on the queens nassau border are pricier because they offer less commuting time to manhattan
8939504 in certain areas like valley stream for instance it would be no problem to find a three bedroom 1 bath colonial for that price and in hempstead you will find many high ranches
8939505 its a good starter home you can finish the attic and improve the value of the home
8939506 last year that high ranch that now costs 400 000 would have cost 425 000 in 2005 it would have been 500 000 buyers today are saving at least 10 percent over early last year

8939548 i was 15 when i started working on it i wanted to do a reggae album and that came through in three or four songs but i also had a linda perry rock song an aaliyah esque timbaland song and a britney sounding neptunes song
8939549 at 15 saying i wanted to do a reggae album after growing up in a snazzy house in houston it was kind of random
8939550 i think i decided is an important record a grammy record and as a live performer shes spectacular you cant hate on it
8939551 they have to understand that i wouldnt do the same kind of stuff the pussycat dolls would
8939552 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered

8939554 the current atmosphere reminds me of the situation in europe in 1914
8939555 there are two dates that have changed the world in recent years sept 11 2001 and aug 8 2008
8939556 sept 11 motivated the united states to behave really differently in the world that is to say americans realized that even in their homes they could not feel safe they had to protect their interests outside the boundaries of the u s for russia it is the same thing we were sitting in our homes the national discussion was internal now this georgian attack is perceived as aggression and made us realize that we cannot stay home we have to go outside our homes to protect ourselves on new frontiers
8939557 only a few months ago the blustery rogozin 44 was regarded even in the kremlin as more performance artist than diplomat
8939558 established officials sometimes rolled their eyes when he was mentioned as if to acknowledge that vladimir putin had dispatched him to nato to do a little trash talking to rattle the west

8939587 no doubt monaco represents the smallest population of any of our national teams but in terms of a worldwide reach there are fewer places that are better known
8939588 this time it will be almost the same but a little bit quicker than the first time because i feel more comfortable at 108 pounds
8939589 the first time it was more difficult because i was up from 105 i think i can put on a little more pressure and be more comfortable
8939590 he caught me with a good punch for the drop but i never felt like i was hurt and if you remember he hit me but i grabbed his waist and he kept on moving and then i touched the floor and i stood up fast i was only a little bit dizzy i was not that hurt
8939591 after that i kept on moving and surviving the round
8939592 hes saying that in this fight hes going to be putting pressure from the beginning from the first round but i believe if he does that hes only got six rounds to do it
8939593 after that he wont have the same legs that he had for the first rounds and im just gonna keep on waiting and when i get my chance im gonna do almost the same thing that floyd mayweather did to oscar de la hoya

8939678 muir weaves commentary thoughtful analyses and humor into a true art form
8939679 muirs genius lies in his giving context to the films
8939680 as a critic muir is acute in his analysis and as a writer he is easy to read
8939681 well grounded in the love and minutiae of sci fi and fantasy adventure
8939682 john kenneth muirs books for mcfarland are distinctive because of their authority and effective research
8939683 he really scrapes beneath the surface of the film and looks for the subtext every nuance is analysed
8939684 an independent film scholar muir explains film studies concepts in a language that is reader friendly and engaging
8939685 john kenneth muir must have had one mis spent youth
8939686 i have read quite a bit of horror film criticism and analysis in my day and john muir is one of the very best if not the best i have ever encountered
8939687 a good 18 steps above the usual dubious faux scholar blogger he takes enormous time and effort analysing unmercifully yet attuned to heretofore dismissed value every release he turns his attention to
8939688 we have received instructions at the foreign ministry and we will cut diplomatic relations with the russian federation
8939689 georgias interests in russia will be represented by the embassy of a third party
8939690 i want to add a disclaimer that it is not at all connected to abkhazia or south ossetia
8939691 we are continuing to experience growth both in terms of client work and staff
8939692 the new offices will give us the space we need to facilitate our current growth and future expansion

8939694 my mother was an entertainment journalist for the cleveland call and post so she would take me with her to events when i was just a baby
8939695 at first i was just playing the rhythm of the songs i would hear
8939696 the older i got the more proficient i got at hearing the notes
8939697 at the same time i embody different genres of music to express different feelings and emotions that i feel in my everyday life my music is always based on my life my happiness my sins my heartbreak my anger my quirkiness my everything is given in my music the music i grew up listening to told a story so im taking the music i grew up with as well as my story as well as my musicianship to bring about a new sound i dont want to sound redundant and talk about myself all the time but i hope my story can help someone elses life if my life were to be a movie it would be the antoine fisher story all over again but with a killer soundtrack and without a military background
8939698 hamiltons progressive production style mixed with witty compound punchline raps is earning him a following in the music industry
8939699 the label doesnt want me to change and im honored that they want me to continue doing what i do and just polish it
8939700 im more of a blogger than a rapper and just a musician who just happens to rap
8939701 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
8939702 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
8939703 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
8939704 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks changing the way they look at property
8939705 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
8939706 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
8939707 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume
8939708 i saw the yard and the garage and i said i have to buy this house
8939709 this is a hard job to do on a bike
8939710 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
8939711 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat
8939712 if they dont want a sweaty realtor then maybe they want someone else
8939713 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth
8939714 ultimately i want to help people find a home thats going to work for them
8939715 this isnt about trying to green wash real estate or profit from a niche about helping people make smart decisions both for themselves and for the planet
8939716 no more 2000s and 2004s the republican party mounted a coordinated criminal campaign to steal the 2004 presidential election and it worked now as another election approaches you and i need to stand together to make absolutely certain it doesnt happen again we need your support to raise the funds now to make sure that no voter is left behind on election day
8939717 today democrats for americas future is launching its nationwide novoterleftbehind net project that will monitor voting on election day in 2008 the squad will shine a public spotlight on every last irregularity democrats for americas future will urge every democratic candidate not to concede a single race until every last vote is counted and from beginning to end from the voter registration process to election day challenges and beyond daf will fight every last fight to the very end insisting that every american is guaranteed a democracys most sacred right their vote
8939718 heres the challenge we have every reason to believe the republicans are at this moment preparing a 2008 vote suppression effort that will rival or even exceed the dirty tricks they pulled in 2004
8939719 i pledge that i will make sure that every vote is counted and that i will contest any evidence of theft or other voter suppression
8939720 in the case of both biden and obamas family whats interesting is that the gentlemen in the family left in 1849 and then their families followed in 1850
8939721 what is even more peculiar is that both of the progenitors were shoemakers
8939722 we have made it quite clear that we are interested in clean waiver from the nsg
8939723 we have presented our case we have made our position clear to interlocutors
8939724 while there is still a distance to go the proposal to give india a clean exemption from global nuclear trade standards is in deep trouble
8939725 the quality of an education system cannot exceed the quality of its teachers

8939730 ein repr sentatives gotteshaus f r die muslime in k ln ist ein zeichen der vielfalt unseres landes und der gelebten religionsfreiheit unserer verfassung
8939731 wir bauen hier f r alle k lner nicht nur f r die muslime
8939732 what is clear is that by unilaterally recognising the independence of abkhazia and south ossetia the russians are not only breaking international law but are also making a mockery of the ceasefire agreement which they claimed to be committed to
8939733 regardless of how this dispute started we european greens have clearly said that both sides primary responsibility was to stop the violence and to adhere to both the letter and the spirit of the ceasefire agreement
8939734 anchorage recruiters say that a rookie officers average pay with overtime in 2007 was nearly 74 000
8939735 i think teams who have deficit should be kicked out of europe
8939736 the only way to go is that there is a control over all of europe and i think it will go that way whether you like it or not
8939737 uefa will bring in a control of the management of every individual club and every individual club will be controlled
8939738 it is very important for the fans of the competition first and it is very important that every club lives with the resources they have available clubs should not speculate and then after one year they cannot pay the salaries for the next seasons
8939739 every transfer nowadays in europe is paid over two or three years and it is compulsory that uefa controls that the commitment of the club is right because if that does not happen it can all collapse very quickly
8939740 last year it was at midnight and we are ready to stay up all night this time if it is needed
8939741 for a while they all talk the talk and nothing happens then in the last four or five days every half an hour there is a headline saying someone has signed somewhere
8939742 when you have experience of transfer dealings you know that as long as something is not signed you know it can change very quickly so you can look very silly so you dont want to come out and announce it
8939743 a word most often avoided in mexico city if you offer a chilango a cigarette or a cup of coffee and he doesnt want it he will raise his hand palm facing inward a symbol of respect and say gracias thank you he will not specify no thank you

8939767 vatican ii council defined the church as the people of god not the pope not the vatican not the hierarchy not the bishops or archbishops not the various congregations that issue statements from the vatican
8939768 because one of the things that we have to change in our politics is the idea that people cannot disagree without challenging each others character and patriotism
8939769 the times are too serious the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook so let us agree that patriotism has no party i love this country and so do you and so does john mccain the men and women who serve in our battlefields may be democrats and republicans and independents but they have fought together and bled together and some died together under the same proud flag they have not served a red america or a blue america they have served the united states of america
8939770 i know there are those who dismiss such beliefs as happy talk
8939771 they claim that our insistence on something larger something firmer and more honest in our public life is just a trojan horse for higher taxes and the abandonment of traditional values and thats to be expected because if you dont have any fresh ideas then you use stale tactics to scare the voters if you dont have a record to run on then you paint your opponent as someone people should run from you make a big election about small things

8939776 the entry into force of the european charter of local self government twenty years ago on 1 september 1988 heralded a new stage of democratic development on our continent leading to a democracy which is more citizen oriented more participatory and therefore more effective
8939777 the charter laid down in particular for the first time in history the principle of subsidiarity that the responsibility for public services should be transferred to the level where they can be delivered most efficiently the level closest to the citizen
8939778 this new understanding acknowledged that the devolution of power towards local communities would release their potential and stir up action involving numerous actors at all levels of governance which would make it possible to take up the great challenges of today
8939779 we will expand our line up of products with displays at 40 inches or larger as demand for them is on the rise

8939784 ladies and gentlmen in my estimation i think were ready for this threat
8939785 i want all of our citizens to make certain they have a plan for leaving the trailers when advised to do so
8939786 what youre going to see is the product of three years of planning training and exercising at all levels of government starting with the local and the state level and leading up to the federal level

8939792 15 year old reggie doesnt know who penned the mysterious journal about the vours wicked creatures that inhabit childrens bodies on sorry night the darkness of the winter solstice
8939793 after playing with the journals incantations on sorry night reggie and her best friend aaron discover the story of the vours is all too real
8939794 together with a small band of believers reggie wages war against an enemy she cannot touch or reason with creatures powerful enough to enslave human bodies and steal souls without detection the vours gorge themselves on human fear feeding their guile their cruelty and their power a cataclysm called the devouring approaches and only reggie halloway can stop it
8939795 she writes with wit intelligence and compassion for her characters this is a story about guys primarily brothers fathers and sons lonely young men who are feeling somewhat lost lurie does a wonderful job of making them real
8939796 if you can do people show me that if you cant if your proportions are always a bit off and you cant get a 3 4 profile right and you cant figure out why your children just look like short adults then for the love of mike dont do people

8939799 i use the word form because it is my job as the illustrator to envision the book as a physical object what size will it be what shape is it going to be oversized or small is it horizontal vertical or square will it work in 32 pages or should it be longer or shorter will the illustrations jauntily hop around in the midst of lots of white space or will they stretch across double pages all the way to the edge of the paper or both will there be a formality to the book or is it more freewheeling

8939815 i dont think the contemporary west has any means to punish a state that is not quite a rogue state
8939816 the kremlin didnt take tbilisi and didnt shoot mikheil saakashvili what the west can really do expelling russia from the g8 or the world trade organisation isnt important
8939817 strategically putin has increased his personal power and satisfied his personal feeling towards mr saakashvili the war was quite brilliant in its design
8939818 i think they are watching very closely to see what will happen at the eu summit on monday
8939819 but i think the kremlin calculation is that the eu wont react seriously

8939840 i am very proud to have been able to put this project together and i believe this new enterprise will bring a lot of excitement and glory to our country

8939847 this time it will be almost the same but a little bit quicker than the first time because i feel more comfortable at 108 pounds
8939848 the first time it was more difficult because i was up from 105 i think i can put on a little more pressure and be more comfortable
8939849 he caught me with a good punch for the drop but i never felt like i was hurt and if you remember he hit me but i grabbed his waist and he kept on moving and then i touched the floor and i stood up fast i was only a little bit dizzy i was not that hurt
8939850 after that i kept on moving and surviving the round
8939851 hes saying that in this fight hes going to be putting pressure from the beginning from the first round but i believe if he does that hes only got six rounds to do it

8939870 the most important finding by factcheck org is their statement that nrlc is correct and that obama is misrepresenting the contents of sb 1083
8939871 factcheck orgs investigation validated the documents that nrlc uncovered and released on august 11 documents that prove that in march 2003 obama killed a bill in his state senate committee that was virtually identical to the bill that passed without a dissenting vote in congress
8939872 we find that as the nrlc said in a recent statement obama voted in committee against the 2003 state bill that was nearly identical to the federal act he says he would have supported
8939873 both contained identical clauses saying that nothing in the bills could be construed to affect legal rights of an unborn fetus according to an undisputed summary written immediately after the committees 2003 mark up session
8939874 rather careful reading of our materials demonstrates that our indictment of sen obama is that his pro abortion commitment runs deep and that his vision of abortion rights is more extreme than that embraced by any member of congress in 2002 extending even beyond the womb under certain circumstances
8939875 the factcheck assertion echoes the position that obama himself took in the illinois senate that what obama called a previable fetus should not be regarded as a legal person even when fully born
8939876 however the u s congress rejected that dangerous doctrine without a dissenting vote in 2002 when it enacted the federal born alive infants protection act which declares babies at any stage of development to be legal persons once they are fully outside the mother
8939877 other groups have talked about civil disobedience today catholic and evangelical christians will hold a peaceful sit in
8939878 to protest the slaughter of the innocent by abortion and to call on fellow christians to reject the obama biden ticket of death
8939879 obamas pick of biden is a gift from god to pro lifers
8939880 bidens horrifying record and betrayal of his faith will help mobilize catholic clergy and laity to defeat them
8939881 we need in the white house starting on january 20th barack obama and joe biden
8939882 barack and joe will champion the issues that we care about
8939883 they will be there with us when we need to get that support from a president and a vice president
8939884 he doesnt believe that women deserve the right to choose
8939885 he would turn the clock back when what we need from our president is forward movement more progress the kind of opportunities that we expect for the next generation of americans
8939886 it was a strange formulation complimenting michelle obama while suggesting that president obama might not always be on the right side of emilys list women and then adding an allusion to the famous 3 00 a m ad
8939887 folks are talking about change and theyre hungry for it in two days were going to make history when we nominate this guy i happen to be married to president of the united states
8939888 those actively campaigning against the bill are clearly of the view that everyday canadians are so lacking in intelligence that if opponents constantly raise points that are not true but sound compelling they will successfully scare people into opposing the bill
8939889 c 484 is crystal clear it applies only when the pregnant woman is the victim of a crime
8939890 if someone attacks her and takes that away from her she has lost something very real to her and her family it matters deeply
8939891 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion
8939892 a las vacaciones aquello que se incrementa en el pago de la hipoteca que

8939897 the closer their nuclear program gets the more nervous they become
8939898 every few days they release a statement as delusory as this last one the aim being to scare off the israeli and american peoples with the message dont mess with us we are a world power
8939899 while israel wants to stop iran going nuclear at all costs there are growing numbers in both parties in america who think iran cannot be stopped and that it will be possible to handle a nuclear iran
8939900 we consider this video though it names no one to be a photographic list of an anti semitic nature and therefore liable to criminal prosecution
8939901 it is not very often that such a discovery happens in which real figures of the past shake off the dust of history and so vividly revive the stories of the bible
8939902 ive had my shouting matches over 25 years privately in my office and in the offices of prime ministers
8939903 ive had disagreements israels a democracy and they make mistakes but the notion that somehow if israel just did the right thing the peace process would work i mean thats the premise give me a break
8939904 the suffering is real on both sides but there is a side that can impact on ending it
8939905 the responsibility rests on those who will not acknowledge the right of israel to exist will not play fair will not deal will not renounce terror
8939906 i do not accept the notion of linkage between iraq and the arab israeli conflict
8939907 arab israeli peace is worth pursuing vigorously on its own merits but even if a peace treaty were signed tomorrow it would not end the civil war in iraq
8939908 ive seen the enormous respect biden commands in the pro israel community
8939909 he has a well established record he knows the issues and he can talk the talk he may be the best goyishe surrogate ive seen in the jewish community
8939910 there is this inextricable tie between culture religion ethnicity that most people dont fully understand that is unique and so strong with jews worldwide
8939911 when i was a young senator i used to say if i were a jew id be a zionist i am a zionist
8939912 you dont have to be a jew to be a zionist
8939913 he was much more knowledgeable about israel and its problems than i was
8939914 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community
8939915 biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the u s and its allies in the middle east
8939916 life should be lived on the edge see every day as a true challenge and then you live your life on the tightrope
8939917 while britains athletes may have won more medals than usual they must remember that they are tainted with the blood of tibetans falun gong practitoners and roman catholic priests
8939918 if you are looking for young heroes and role models forget the highly paid athletes who leave their consciences at passport control and consider the sacrifice being made by our soldiers in afghanistan and iraq
8939919 the mayors support for our athletes as they return from beijing has been totally undermined by one of his senior appointments mr coleman has gone out of his way to personally attack insult and disparage the remarkable achievements of the british team
8939920 while the rest of the country have seen how uplifting success at the olympics can be and have swung behind london 2012 mr colemans gross insult does nothing but undermine and embarrass the city
8939921 we should be giving our young athletes all the resources and support possible not rubbishing and going out of our way to put them down
8939922 this is a fantastic deal for the council and im delighted the club will not only be moving to the city but also changing their name to the glasgow rocks
8939923 bringing a professional club like the rocks here will help put glasgow on the national and international stage as a city which is committed to sporting excellence particularly as they will eventually be based at the national indoor sports arena
8939924 the players from the club already deliver a range of significant activities for young people many of whom are vulnerable through the scottish sports futures programme
8939925 the council and its partners will now work with the club to do even more to enrich peoples lives in glasgow
8939926 all of us at the rocks are thrilled with this new partnership
8939927 glasgow has been such a strong supporter of our community efforts for several years now and this agreement is another step in the right direction for the rocks the local community and the sport of basketball
8939928 the new nisa facility will be one of the finest in the uk and we can already see the cooperation and commitment of from the city that will help us build the sport and the fan base that will fill that 5000 arena
8939929 meanwhile were also looking forward to our time at kelvin hall well be right in the heart of glasgows west end and the set up will provide and electric atmosphere
8939930 the players think the added noise level should help the team win a few extra games and hopefully bring home some silverware
8939931 this really is an exciting time for the rocks and we have this new glasgow partnership to thank for making it all possible
8939932 if the government wants an open dialogue and consultation with local people then this is simply not acceptable excluding people who cannot get hold of the designated form is just restricting the opportunities local people have to get their voice heard speaking in the house of commons in july when the plan was published i made it quite clear that it is vital that local people have confidence in this consultation process restricting access like this goes against the basic principles of a fair and equitable consultation the plan is suggesting some very dramatic changes to our local landscape and i have insisted to the secretary of state that everyone has the opportunity to have his or her voice heard
8939933 the grief group was part of the process i needed for myself and i knew i wasnt alone
8939934 brought the community together not only to remember but to share memories too since i cant make any more memories with my friend it was important to share what we all have
8939935 were pretty appalled that people would do this its just a hateful act that is completely uncalled for
8939936 im sorry that this hateful gesture has intruded on our community
8939937 the police are investigating it as vandalism and they werent specific about what they expected they would be able to find
8939938 im excited to go back to school seeing all my friends again
8939939 im looking forward to getting back to studying math and science my favourite subjects
8939940 hes a picky eater so the lunch thing thats the hard part
8939941 shes finally going to learn her alphabet and numbers and were both happy and excited about it
8939942 there is so much that still needs to be done
8939943 it opened my eyes and i definitely want to continue doing volunteer work
8939944 many people especially families with children have been putting off trips to israel in part because of the inconvenience of having to travel to newark or new york this flight will alleviate this concern
8939945 having this nonstop flight to and from tel aviv daily will certainly boost tourism from the philadelphia area
8939946 when people can fly nonstop from point to point it makes a huge difference
8939947 we are hoping they will come out with low rates to introduce their service and make the market a little more competitive
8939948 this makes our region a much more attractive site for israeli companies to do business with
8939949 we know the torah has a certain amount of letters and these letters are holy and if there is one extra letter that torah cant be used
8939950 you need a lot of cows to make a torah
8939951 youve got to be very careful because here unfortunately theres a lot of fraud
8939952 its very important when it comes to mezuzahs to know who makes it who writes it
8939953 you have to be at your highest spiritual level every time you write gods name
8939954 beautifully written and finely balanced a disarmingly readable contribution to the history of ideas elegant thoughtful imaginative his book will give abiding pleasure
8939955 its becoming more common to see families committing to driving less
8939956 i think its a part of the market that will continue to grow as gas gets more expensive
8939957 living out in the suburbs just isnt a big deal anymore
8939958 people want to live work and go to school within a six blocks radius thats changing the way they look at property
8939959 for people who want to drive less it just makes sense that theyd be looking for different things in a neighborhood
8939960 kirsten was able to see things about places we were looking that i dont think a normal agent would have noticed
8939961 youre going to want to look at streets with low traffic volume
8939962 i saw the yard and the garage and i said i have to buy this house
8939963 this is a hard job to do on a bike
8939964 you have to get the right people and the day has to be nice you have to be looking at property in the same couple mile location
8939965 if youre meeting someone on location youre not exactly business presentable when you show up dripping with sweat
8939966 if they dont want a sweaty realtor then maybe they want someone else
8939967 most people dont care the last clients i took out bought an 800 000 house they arent exactly poor people living off the earth
8939968 ultimately i want to help people find a home thats going to work for them
8939969 this isnt about trying to green wash real estate or profit from a niche market its about helping people make smart decisions both for themselves and for the planet
8939970 my biggest concern with the income data is that were getting off to a weak start to the third quarter
8939971 the income numbers are a reminder that the economy is going to look worse before it gets better
8939972 dont read their lips when californias republican lawmakers say no new taxes theyve put it in writing signed their names essentially inviting their own party to oust them if they renege
8939973 if you break the pledge the people who voted for you will say excuse me not only did you raise my taxes but you lied to me said
8939974 the tax pledge whose signers are publicized on the groups web site is a written promise to voters that
8939975 opponents argue that such vows can torpedo budget talks by making the outcome intensely personal and hamper efforts to find tradeoffs in bridging the states 15 2 billion deficit
8939976 with republicans running so far to the right and democrats to the left the governor complained they cant meet in the middle
8939977 schwarzenegger also said hed like to see california return to an open primary
8939978 between the redistricting and open primaries it would change the whole situation the governor contended

8939980 look at karen he continued referring to assembly speaker karen bass d los angeles as leader its her first budget i mean poor girl she gets thrown into this it makes it very very difficult when people start from scratch all the time

8939989 the republican governor spoke wednesday in los angeles at a news conference with local government officials to pressure lawmakers into rejecting borrowing options to resolve the states 15 2 billion budget shortfall
8939990 its an easy assumption but it is absolutely ridiculous corcoran said
8939991 senate bill 1420 cleared the assembly on a 46 27 vote wednesday and is expected to make it out of the senate later this week
8939992 gov arnold schwarzenegger who vetoed a similar bill last year has not taken a position on the legislation but its chances have improved with the restaurant association dropping its opposition
8939993 the revised legislation would set a uniform state standard for displaying nutritional information instead of the growing patchwork of local ordinances raising industry concerns
8939994 martin sheen the politically liberal actor who has advocated a tough love approach to drug addiction is teaming up with california law and order groups to lead the charge against an initiative that would increase funding for rehabilitation programs
