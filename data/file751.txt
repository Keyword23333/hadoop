7510034 most people dont like guns they dont want to see them especially at school they want to believe they are in a perfectly safe bubble and think guns are for bad guys and violent movies its wasted energy to attempt to change their minds trying to force acceptance by openly carrying will not change their opinions it will only create a hostile environment and increase their efforts to eliminate guns on campus when you conceal carry nobody is the wiser people who are anti gun dont have to get nervous and permit holders still have their weapons with them on campus u gun owners should have appreciation for all they enjoy not muddle the system with unnecessary demands concealed carry is a perfect scenario and something many other states can only dream about lets just allow open carry to rest in peace
7510035 we are ready to take any decision up to halting relations altogether
7510036 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7510037 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7510038 in less than 100 years the georgian military has three times carried out genocide against the ossetian people why are they killing us because we simply want to live as equals with all the other nations
7510039 if it does this russia will further isolate itself from the entire world and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of georgia

7510045 a survey of recent customer opinion reveals that their decision making process is heavily influenced by movie releases
7510046 halloween costumes that relate to the latest big screen releases and television hits will always be popular with shoppers as will those that reflect political trends
7510047 in big election years politics play a huge role in determining which costumes will sell like hotcakes and which ones might sit on a shelf
7510048 make sure you know the trends your customers and whats popular and likely to remain so
7510049 when you can tap into the trends and make sure your costume selection reflects them consumers will not turn to your competitors for their halloween needs
7510050 being familiar with political world hollywood and television events is an absolute must
7510051 local issues should also be considered when making the final selection
7510052 the more informed shop owners are about cultural and political happenings the more likely they are to pick the perfect costumes for a particular year
7510053 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7510054 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7510055 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7510056 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7510057 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7510059 investment in china has been boosted by the governments energy policy which secures renewable energy as a vital and important part of the countrys energy mix
7510060 to make the uk a world leader in attracting investment in this sector and to avoid it slipping further down the index the government needs to consider creating tangible incentives for investors following the lead of germany and the ambition of china
7510061 china is also likely to become a significant exporter of wind turbine equipment in a few years adding to its already strong presence in the solar industry

7510066 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

7510068 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7510069 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7510070 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7510071 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7510072 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7510073 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7510074 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7510075 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7510076 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7510077 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7510078 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7510079 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7510080 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7510081 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7510082 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7510083 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7510084 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7510085 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7510086 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7510087 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7510088 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7510089 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7510090 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners

7510122 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
7510123 everything now hinges on stopping coal whether we prevent runaway climate change largely depends on whether we keep using the most carbon intensive fossil fuel unless we either leave it and the carbon dioxide it produces in the ground human development will start spiralling backwards the more coal is burnt the smaller are our chances of future comfort and prosperity
7510124 ccs ready could be used as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
7510125 let nuclear plant building happen as long as its total emissions are taken into account we know exactly how and where the waste is to be buried how much this will cost and who will pay
7510126 unlike ccs wind wave tidal solar hydro and geothermal power are proven technologies unlike nuclear power they can be safely decommissioned as soon as they become redundant
7510127 it is not because of polar bears that i will be joining the climate camp outside the coal plant at kingsnorth it is not because of butterflies or frogs or penguins or rainforests much as i love them all it is because everything i have fought for and that all campaigners for social justice have ever fought for food clean water shelter security is jeopardised by climate change those who claim to identify a conflict between environmentalism and humanitarianism have either failed to read the science or have refused to understand it
7510128 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs is enormous i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
7510129 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7510130 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7510131 it is a big priority we have played two league games and we have taken three points
7510132 we have got a massive game at home against west brom on the saturday after and then fulham the saturday after that away from home
7510133 but the priority now becomes beating northampton at home we want to do as well as we possibly can in that cup
7510134 i want to pick the strongest team i can to get through in that competition
7510135 what was happening to us last year was purely as a reaction to what our league form was doing but we are not in that position just at the moment and hopefully wont be
7510136 there may be one or two forced on us because of a couple of knocks that we got on saturday
7510137 but i would like to be in a position where we can give it everything we have possibly got to win the competitions that we are entering
7510138 last year we had issues purely and simply because of our league position and that had to be where we prioritised
7510139 but we will be putting out a strong team against northampton because we want to go through
7510140 we would like to bring somebody in we would like to bring a minimum of two people into the football club if we can
7510141 we are not a champions league team we have got some champions league qualities about us in terms of effort and desire and all that
7510142 but what we have got to try to do is bring in two players who we can put into that first team to make us better and not just two bodies
7510143 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7510144 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7510145 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7510146 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7510147 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7510148 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7510149 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7510150 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7510151 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7510152 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7510153 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7510154 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7510155 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy

7510164 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7510165 we are ready to take any decision up to halting relations altogether

7510178 same store sales are down 8 through the first 2 1 2 weeks of august the particularly poor economic climate in california florida and the desert southwest continues to adversely affect nearly 25 of our stores and we do not expect conditions in these regions to improve in the near term we expect that same store sales will decline in the high single digits
7510179 during the quarter we continued to move forward with our strategy to grow our apparel business enhance productivity of our real estate portfolio and reduce or exit unprofitable product classifications
7510180 our apparel business showed a solid 13 same store sales increase during the quarter and now represents 81 of our total sales we expect to end the year with apparel representing 85 of our sales mix we believe that by concentrating on apparel and reducing our emphasis on lower margin footwear and accessories we can improve our merchandise margins over time junior apparel achieved same store sales growth of 26 duing the quarter and now represents 51 of our apparel sales we believe there is an additional opportunity to grow the junior business and have set our next target milestone to be 55 of our apparel sales at this level we would still be below many of our peer group whose junior mix is typically greater than 60 of sales
7510181 i remain confident in our belief that we are taking the appropriate actions to improve the areas of the business where we have direct control 2008 remains very challenging but we believe that we are doing the right things to position our company for success when the environment improves in the meantime we will continue to manage expenses and capital needs prudently for the remainder of the year

7510186 because of the companys refusal to take these complaints seriously these loyal employees were forced to seek justice through the courts
7510187 were pleased that independent jurors saw this companys reprehensible conduct for what it was
7510188 we hope that this verdict sends a message to at amp t and all other companies that these complaints need to be taken seriously and their diversity commitment needs to be more than window dressing
7510189 the online education market continues to scale and remains an important driver of our overall business

7510192 luxury vehicle drivers have had the benefit of radar distance warning systems in their vehicles for some time
7510193 unfortunately the expenses associated with medical treatment along with loss of income during that period of time are simply too much of a financial hurdle at this point liquidating the domain name portfolio and using the proceeds to pay for medical and living expenses is the most responsible way for us to manage an unfortunate set of circumstances
7510194 our strategy combines the use of youtube style videos audio testimonials and blogging tools as a more effective way to communicate with prospective clients and customers
7510195 one problem with most of todays industry standard websites is that theyre static and provide text based content with a photo or two prospective buyers want more than whats written about a dentist or attorney on their website they want to see and hear them in action they want to hear what other patients and clients have to say about their experiences most people are using the internet to do initial research before they take the time to meet face to face with a service professional and online audio video is one of the best ways for a service provider to make that initial connection
7510196 we are on the leading edge of changes in the industry unfortunately you dont get to choose when something like this is going to happen
7510197 this comprehensive portfolio is the perfect compliment to other types of marketing services including search engine optimization website design and development or even traditional advertising and promotion for a progressive company who is looking to differentiate themselves from their competitors and provide additional value to their customers these domain names will provide a great return on investment to a buyer who recognizes the power of the internet

7510200 so many people on this planet cant even safely drink their water and we need 3 iphones frugality is not the issue here and no one should be ashamed of success we ought to live comfortably but can we do it better
7510201 sustainable economic development for us in the west will come with an eco minded sustainable middle class everywhere else and it is not by replicating our wasteful model in china and india that we will achieve success on this planet as a species

7510205 i look forward to my contribution as an advisor to psychogenics a stimulating company with a unique and innovative approach to drug discovery
7510206 explained dr eric nestler scientific co founder and chairman of psychogenics
7510207 well end up blundering into cities plastered with the equivalent of flash banners and microsites
7510208 technologists are busying themselves turning buildings into displays or at least draping them with informatics whether physically or via various forms of augmented reality its all really exciting thoughtful stuff with tons of thrilling prototypes and sketches it reminds me of early webiness because unless im missing something theres not a lot of sophisticated thinking about how this intersects with commerce marketing and advertising and im very willing to believe im missing something this is why this is a bit of a voyage of discovery and i just noticed today that adam greenfields talking about it here the city is already festooned with persuasion screens are already talking to phones and animating transport systems but its not being done by thoughtful ui experts its being done by poster contractors at the behest of advertising agencies
7510209 is there some connection to the admittedly unformed notion of pre experience design how cool would it be if the data thats draped around the city leaks back into communications and if those communications helped to explain and contextualise that data
7510210 it may very well be that as phones become more like small computers able to access the web and deliver email without being out of reach and data costs continue to decline even small scale farmers will eventually begin to be able to take advantage of more sophisticated data delivery projects could for example send detailed information via email to farmers as opposed to the short text that sms allows
7510211 you know i believe that cities are all about difficulty theyre about waiting for the bus for the light to change for your order of chinese take out to be ready theyre about frustration about parking tickets dogshit potholes and noisy neighbors theyre about the unavoidable physical and psychic proximity of other human beings competing for the same limited pool of resources the fear of crime and its actuality these challenges have conditioned the experience of place for as long as weve gathered together in settlements large and dense enough to be called cities and as it happens with our networked ambient pervasive informatic technology we now have or think we have the means to address some of these frustrations in economic terms these technologies both lower the information costs people face in trying to make the right decisions and lower the opportunity cost of having made them so you dont head out to the bus stop until the bus stop tells you a bus is a minute away and you dont walk down the street where more than some threshold number of muggings happen in fact by default it doesnt even show up on your maps and you dont eat at the restaurant whose forty eight recent health code violations cause its name to flash red in your address book and all these decisions are made possible because networked informatics have effectively rendered the obscure and the hidden transparent to inquiry and theres no doubt that life is thusly made just that little bit better but theres a cost theres always a cost serendipity solitude anonymity most of what we now recognize as the makings of urban savoir faire it all goes by the wayside and yes were richer and safer and maybe even happier with the advent of the services and systems im so interested in but by the same token were that much poorer for the loss of these intangibles its a complicated trade off and i believe in most places its one were making without really examining whats at stake
7510212 the devices capabilities and available interface modalities at any given moment are largely if not entirely determined by the other networked objects around it if you pair the device with a text its a reader at the checkstand it provides a friendly pos interface aimed at the skyline it augments reality why this argument is so self evident to longterm ixd folks and so relatively hard for anyone else to grok is i believe a function of the fact that we already take for granted the rather significant assumption from which it proceeds that the greater part of the places and things we find in the world will be provided with the ability to speak and account for themselves that theyll constitute a coherent environment an ontome of self describing networked objects and that well find having some means of handling the information flowing off of them very useful indeed the second thing mac got right is more subtle and its a line about the evolution of mobile devices that i think is deeply correct its that the device is of almost no importance in and of itself that its importance to the person using it lies in the fact that its a convenient aperture to the open services available in the environment locally as well as globally mac happens to have interpreted this metaphor particularly literally but theres nothing wrong with that its certainly a defensible choice the business lesson that drops out of it though and of course i would think this is that the crafting of an impeccable user experience is virtually the only differentiator left to a would be player in this market with clear implications for allocation of organizational effort and resources

7510219 for sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace
7510220 its satans ultimate desire to cause christians to believe that living under grace has abolished the necessity of obeying gods law or that it is of no consequence what you believe as long as you believe in jesus the bible disagrees with both of these notions
7510221 obedience to gods law will never save however the law plays an integral role in pointing out what sin is thus creating a need for christ the saviour the fruit of accepting this invitation is living in obedience to gods laws
7510222 jesus said that if you love me keep my commandments and seeing that he and the father are one then the ten commandments are also jesus commandments
7510223 if god could have canceled his law then jesus would never have needed suffer death on the cross in place of humanitys transgression of gods law

7510226 cctv is showing instead a ping pong match between a chinese player and a swede a diving contest involving two chinese stars interviews with a foreign coach of a chinese team and replays of week old swimming events in which chinese athletes did well these are at the very instant that the mens 5000m is underway same thing during mens 800m will this apply to the mens and womens 4x400 relays arggh one world one dream
7510227 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7510228 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7510229 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7510230 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7510231 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7510232 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7510233 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7510234 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7510235 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7510236 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7510237 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7510238 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7510239 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7510240 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7510241 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7510242 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7510243 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7510244 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7510245 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7510246 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7510247 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7510248 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7510249 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7510250 la memoria es el pilar sobre el que se sostiene la persona
7510251 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7510253 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7510254 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7510255 results of genetic testing from three samples of the products recalled by maple leaf foods show that two tested positive for the outbreak strain of listeria
7510256 there is a very active effort to work with all the food distribution customers but it is not as direct because there are customers and then those customers have customers
7510257 youre just petty politicians whod sooner sign onto the wisdom of a tyrant in another country than the demands of ticked off voters in your own
7510258 the point i made and ill make it again is that al qaeda functions on the basis that they think they can break our will thats their fundamental underlying strategy that if they can kill enough americans or cause enough havoc create enough chaos in iraq then well quit and go home and my statement was that if we adopt the pelosi policy that then we will validate the strategy of al qaeda i said it and i meant it
7510259 a political party cannot be all things to all people it must represent certain fundamental beliefs which must not be compromised to political expediency or simply to swell its numbers
7510260 oh no first of all if i took one vote away from a serious candidate it would be a sin
7510261 small and medium sized businesses depend on intel technology to stay competitive

7510264 that chinese dude who ran around the top of the stadium
7510265 i fear this will make americans think chinese are bad
7510266 in an earlier survey on the election and health care reform physicians were fairly evenly divided as to the solution for improving our health care system
7510267 twenty seven percent said it was universal health care with multi payer reimbursement twenty three percent said it was universal health care with single payer reimbursement and twenty five percent selected tax credits to allow more people to afford healthcare
7510268 universal health care would reduce my income in the short term but the longer term effect would be good since the current system isnt sustainable
7510269 more regulatory and bureaucratic hoops to jump through decreased income perhaps a decreased workload as access to care plummets

7510276 many of my friends in the legal fraternity have never been comfortable dealing with their own marketing they either offload their marketing campaigns to high cost agencies or refrain from it altogether
7510277 internet marketing is the smartest way to market today its so important to befriend it
7510278 there are zillions of articles on internet marketing but for a legal professional the guidance to apply it is hard to find most of our competitors offer products that are suitable for the marketing professionals our club is meant for the business manager of a law firm who has his own challenges and no time to get into technical details of either marketing or internet
7510279 legalimarketing is supported by several domain experts who understand the backgrounds of lawyers and share best practices and viewpoints in a language they understand

7510303 earthworms help ragweed thrive by systematically collecting and burying its seeds in their burrows
7510304 in fact weve found that more than two thirds of all giant ragweed seedlings emerge from earthworm burrows
7510305 our study shows that nightcrawlers are some of natures most effective weed farmers
7510306 they actively forage for weed seeds pull them into their burrows and then plant them under up to several inches of soil
7510307 we found the worms collect and bury 10 types of seeds in the same size range
7510308 but they have three special favorites giant ragweed bur cucumber sicyos angulatus and sunflower helianthus annuus
7510309 research that helps us understand the accumulation of weed seeds in the soil and how weeds are spread is critical to the development of new effective management strategies
7510310 giant ragweed should be vigorously controlled in fields and gardens in order to minimize further seed production and protect plant growth and crop yields

7510319 but in a tight race we cant afford to lose a small number hopefully obama will bring in enough new and first time voters to offset that
7510320 there is a definition of black america but no definition of white america
7510321 especially not really getting an opportunity to help the team whos to say if we had the opportunity to play it could be a different outcome in 04 thats one thing we did great in this tournament we used our bench thats the reason were better than everybody we dont got one or two guys weve got 12 guys who can play
7510322 then they come back and hit a three then we hit another three and they come back and hit two more threes and now its up four and and
7510323 im kind of crazy because im watching the whole game in my head again the intensity was unbelievable
7510324 we should be very proud of the effort we showed
7510325 tonight we shot 70 percent and were up by six
7510326 at one point i said youve got to be kidding me we wanted to play good defense and it was hard to do it spain executed they shot the ball they made big plays
7510327 and to be sitting in front of you guys tonight on top of the world i think we did a helluva job of putting americas basketball where its supposed to be which is at the top of the world
7510328 i would say already we can feel it that the young players want to be part of this
7510329 the first or second year stars players just drafted out of college agents are calling players are calling point is now that we have gotten it to this point we have a chance to take it to another level and that would be something that would be really important to u s basketball
7510330 three times between now and november someone in chicago obamas headquarters will be answering the phone with these three words
7510331 anyhow i would be lying if i said that young joe seemed destined for politics let alone greatness he had little to distinguish himself from the teenaged crowd that i aspired to be a part of beyond having overcome a bad stutter to become a handsome and loquacious babe magnet who happened to have the nicest parents in the world
7510332 biden is a reliable supporter of virtually every prevailing bit of conventional wisdom within the american elite political consensus which is why his selection has been widely praised by the establishment
7510333 after biden ended his own presidential candidacy in january he declined to endorse either obama or clinton instead as the two rivals battled on without him biden was regularly on the phone with both of them he told me earlier this year offering views and advice and sometimes just comfort each candidate knew he was talking to the other each trusted him biden is thus a clinton friendly choice even if not all her supporters will see it that way one of the largest gaps between obama and clinton is her perception that he has not worked as hard as she has to master foreign policy in biden obama has an interlocutor whom clinton respects
7510334 if obama is honest in saying he wants a vice president who will be direct in stating his views and will not worry about offending the president he has found the right man biden brings a blue collar sensibility that has been lacking in obamas campaign reflecting his background in scranton pa and wilmington del i know of democratic governors who fear that bidens prolix rhetoric will go right over the heads of their constituents but he has worked hard at shortening his answers to questions and as david brooks noted in his new york times column urging bidens selection this is a guy whose authenticity and heart on the sleeve passions are real the message he surely has brought to obama is your background looks elitist to many of the people i represent the way to overcome that impression is to be in their neighborhoods talk directly to them in small groups and show them you really understand the struggles in their lives biden surely does that
7510335 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7510336 we feel confidant that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7510337 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7510338 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7510339 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids

7510345 unjury is a viable option for those who are tired of yo yo dieting
7510346 unfortunately most diets pose obstacles and roadblocks in the pursuit of an ongoing solution unjury works because it removes many of these roadblocks and obstacles
7510347 its just too difficult for most people to adopt radical changes in the number of calories they consume
7510348 for many the feeling of hunger serves as a constant obstacle in meeting weight loss objectives
7510349 diets often fail because they dont provide an easy way of controlling hunger and maintaining overall health
7510350 a calorie counter doesnt help when its 11am or 3pm and youre starving
7510351 dieters often avoid foods such as meat eggs and cheese unfortunately these foods are also good sources of protein reducing protein intake can have an effect on both weight loss and overall health
7510352 it appears that when we dont get enough high quality protein your satiety decreases and a sense of feeling hungry can increase your body needs protein the framework of every cell in your body is made with protein protein has an important role to play inside cells and in communications between cells sufficient protein is essential for a healthy immune system and good energy levels unjury helps the body get the quality protein it needs without the fat and cholesterol
7510353 the quality of the protein impacts taste and the value it adds to your body
7510354 the first thing people notice about unjury is the taste many protein supplements just dont taste good they can be chalky and gritty they often coat your mouth and have an aftertaste
7510355 a survey of recent customer opinion reveals that their decision making process is heavily influenced by movie releases
7510356 halloween costumes that relate to the latest big screen releases and television hits will always be popular with shoppers as will those that reflect political trends
7510357 in big election years politics play a huge role in determining which costumes will sell like hotcakes and which ones might sit on a shelf
7510358 make sure you know the trends your customers and whats popular and likely to remain so
7510359 when you can tap into the trends and make sure your costume selection reflects them consumers will not turn to your competitors for their halloween needs
7510360 being familiar with political world hollywood and television events is an absolute must
7510361 local issues should also be considered when making the final selection
7510362 the more informed shop owners are about cultural and political happenings the more likely they are to pick the perfect costumes for a particular year

7510376 its natural for parents to make sacrifices to ensure that their kids get the very best
7510377 but it becomes a problem when these sacrifices are detrimental to ones health what tends to happen is that parents will put themselves last this increases their stress and the likelihood that they will eventually become sick
7510378 the majority of all respondents 83 per cent said that they have gone to work sick or exhausted
7510379 in this case parents did so to avoid having their work pile up and ensure that they would have enough time for their kids but this sometimes leads to serious illness and longer periods of time away from family and work
7510380 parents want to provide their kids with an enriched childhood full of opportunities and experiences but lets remember that school life balance is just as important as work life balance sometimes the basic lessons of life taught at home are just as enriching if not more so
7510381 dan kom je er niet uit en ik bel de politie

7510387 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7510388 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7510389 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that

7510395 theres no doubt these market conditions are weighing on retirees
7510396 today we get 401 k s while our parents are living on pensions guaranteed for life
7510397 you lay on top of that the health care crisis in this country which is of mammoth proportions and whatever savings retirees have will ultimately be emasculated by the need to pay for health coverage in their aging and potentially ailing years
7510398 historically every generation has prided itself on leaving behind a better condition than they inherited when they were born
7510399 this will not be the case for the next generation largely because of the loss of pensions
7510400 for most investors who are income oriented investors the most valuable products for them will be well diversified bond funds
7510401 that will be the best environment to preserve their principle and provide a better than average income and possibly much better than average
7510402 very rarely is the income from any safe investments by itself enough to support retirement and cover inflation
7510403 in times like now when interest rates are very low the pressure is even greater

7510411 we knew itd be easier for freshmen to find their way to their classes with 1 000 fewer people in the halls

7510413 russlands pr sident medwedew wird wahrscheinlich der duma folgen und beide abtr nnigen republiken anerkennen
7510414 die frage ist welche anderen l nder werden diese beiden republiken auch als unabh ngig anerkennen
7510415 andererseits kann der westen auch nicht akzeptieren dass russland einseitig eine situation schafft
7510416 das eigentliche problem ist langfristig die sicherung des einflusses russlands in einer sehr wichtigen energiegegend ber georgien laufen die einzigen alternativen pipelines die zentralasiatisches gas und l nach westen bringen und russland m chte diese gegend nicht der amerikanischen geopolitik berlassen

7510420 obama has picked someone who is going to be very aggressive in going after mccain and who is not going to be recalcitrant about it
7510421 if i was mccain id be thinking about my own attack dog
7510422 hes going to want someone who can go toe to toe with biden
7510423 certainly biden was a big choice for obama and it does therefore force mccain to think about a big choice both in terms of debates and the potential demographic or state by state advantages in who he picks for his running mate
7510424 obama has effectively checked mccain on mccains only relevant argument by choosing biden who has more foreign policy and washington experience than mccain
7510425 tsmc sat on the sidelines for several years but now appears convinced that mems is ready for prime time with consumer electronics and mobile applications

7510451 many cages had feces in them all had poor ventilation the sheer number of animals was overwhelming and the odor of urine in 90 plus degree heat was stifling
7510452 its a national travesty that the puppy mill industry is allowed to flood the market every year with so many dogs being killed each year in animal shelters

7510501 the american consumer has long been the single biggest force propping up the us and the global economy

7510520 but we are seeing a huge expansion of this thought for fall
7510521 everyone who sees dr seuss new apparel line talks about which book was their favorite growing up and we see that with all our retro tees and toys like holgate they are classics and they open up a way to share memories between parents siblings and even the littlest ones while being totally fun at the same time
7510522 we love appamans fresh perspective and we are thrilled to be carrying the first season of their denim

7510535 much as warsaw remains the most developed market regional cities especially krak w and wroc aw are clearly coming to the fore in terms of growth dynamics investors are also becoming increasingly interested in cities whose development has so far been less dynamic for instance katowice and d as well as szczecin and lublin
7510536 at the moment most big investments act on the basis of pre let agreement before the property is built
7510537 in warsaw we still see the biggest demand for office space up to 700 sqm
7510538 but it is still the warsaw standard to lease office space rather than to buy it
7510539 each company whose products appear on this list was chosen for one defining characteristic their ability to deliver robust customer value

7510887 more and more students are looking for college information on the web and were trying to get more information out to them
7510888 in the fall of 2004 we had 3 727 freshmen
7510889 its too close to tell i think were going to be somewhere near there but until i see the final i dont want to say record breaking
7510890 as we look to the future high school class sizes will start shrinking
7510891 we are actually trying to expand our outreach and go more to out of state markets where in some states the number of high school graduates are going to grow
7510892 ive certainly grown to really appreciate the carolina football fans
7510893 they get tremendously excited this time of year and the reason is they have hope that maybe something really good can happen this year hopefully weve got a team that can give them hope and results but time will only tell if we have that type of team we do have hope good things are going to happen this year
7510894 we do have better athletes as far as size speed and strength
7510895 we have a new quarterback tommy beecher that is an unknown he hasnt played much he has the capability to make excellent decisions throughout the game we have to wait to see how he does
7510896 tommys going to get a chance to go the distance
7510897 tommys our quarterback and tommy has proven hes our best guy right now if tommy gets hurt were confident smelley can go in there and play well hes better than he was last year
7510898 stoney is a senior hes started a lot around here
7510899 im sure carlos will play a bit and akeem akeems right there
7510900 coach ray rychleski said thats something he may want to do
7510901 we were out there trying to audible the other day
7510902 i said well former wide receiver carlos knows all our audibles larry freeman knows them all culliver knows them all weve got to use phony audibles against our defense all the time
7510903 virginia tech called down here when i first got here to schedule a game and i told coach frank beamer i dont think we need to play you guys right now
7510904 theyve been the top team in the acc were sort of in the middle of the sec and the north carolina schools have been in the middle i thought it was a pretty evenly matched game that the fans would like to see
7510905 his teams at boston college were good that team came close to winning the conference championship last year most guys that were on that team were guys that he had recruited and trained
7510906 he likes to run the ball boston college has won their last eight bowl games he won six or seven of them at nc state theyve turned the corner and theyre a good looking team his teams dont play with a bunch of mistakes his players play with good discipline and within the rules were trying to get that established here
7510907 you dont know what youve got until you go play were trying to stay a little under the radar with not talking too big well let our play on the field do the talking that needs to be said i dont know if we have a good team right now or an average team i dont know yet well have to wait until thursday we ve done a lot of things different but well just have to go see this thursday night
7510908 more and more students are looking for college information on the web and were trying to get more information out to them
7510909 in the fall of 2004 we had 3 727 freshmen
7510910 its too close to tell i think were going to be somewhere near there but until i see the final i dont want to say record breaking

7510913 parta will continue to provide transportation to citizens of portage country whether or not the drivers decide to strike people who depend on parta for their daily transportation needs can be assured that parta will get them where they need to go
7510914 i think the faculty recognized that it was a fair and good contract
7510915 i am pleased that it was approved by a relatively wide margin
7510916 it was a bit awkward but nothing i cant handle
7510917 the university admissions office has been very successful in increasing the size of our freshman class
7510918 i think thats part of what were seeing a national trend whether its the economy whether its the convenience of living on campus
7510919 im not quite sure what all is playing into it but i think its a combination of upperclass students remaining on campus and then the success of the new freshman class
7510920 this week alone weve had probably about 35 students who have applied for housing
7510921 they are making accommodations to make sure all students have privacy just as they would have in a normal room
7510922 i think its interesting that we have a lot of upperclassmen that want to live in the residence halls
7510923 i think it says a lot about the quality of our residence halls
7510924 our students are asking for fresher newer items and well give it to them
7510925 its going to support two new hires at lci that are called ohio research scholars
7510926 creating the conditions that would create new jobs is a big part of this
7510927 basically this is just ksu students working for ksu students
7510928 its a great way for students on the academic side and the entertainment or social side
7510929 instead of working with that company we made it all student run and so the benefit is 100 percent for ksu students
7510930 mostly its going to be freshmen and sophomores living on campus so were gearing it towards them
7510931 with blu ray coming in and all kinds of different changes in technology we want to get that perspective of what are the needs of the new freshmen
7510932 our students are asking for fresher newer items and well give it to them
7510933 our type of operation is very conducive to student life
7510934 these people just dont get it theyre here for business
7510935 we think its going to make this area look attractive
7510936 we were really excited about the incoming freshmen and the players that we still had for this season and what we could all bring to the table
7510937 were pleased with what weve seen so far and theyve really challenged themselves to be a solid unified team
7510938 and not only support our players but show them what we expect and how we expect to have things go on and off the field
7510939 as seniors we also need to be there as a support system for each other not only on the field but off the field
7510940 it doesnt matter who youre playing in the conference its going to be an unbelievable challenge for 90 minutes
7510941 we really dont pay a whole lot of attention to predictions
7510942 its all about who shows up to play the day of that game and we just need to make sure that were the team that shows up at every game
7510943 we know that the team we have this fall is a lot different from the team we had last fall
7510944 we know what we can produce and we can definitely produce more than a ninth place finish
7510945 every single team member was in the box and everyone was scrambling for it
7510946 the goalie came out and we had lauren evans who challenged it and the ball popped out and i just played it into the right corner
7510947 this year they kept on fighting tooth and nail to make sure it went in the back of the net
7510948 at half time we talked to each other and said that we need to finish it no matter what the weather is
7510949 we went in with a good attitude and tried to finish it
7510950 there are a lot of little tweaks that we need to make in order to make it a more consistent effort for 90 minutes
7510951 but the bottom line is they worked extremely hard and fought to make sure that we came out with a victory
7510952 when you schedule some of the teams that we do and we have a very difficult schedule this season youre going to find that
7510953 its nice to see us getting on the road and picking up a win
7510954 we were playing a game to 15 and if anyone had a hitting error before we got to five they lost
7510955 i dont think they were unrealistic challenges but we didnt meet those challenges
7510956 this is our team motto prevail finding a way against any team to prevail
7510957 we have some work to do for sure but we have a week to do it
7510958 even though we havent played a match yet we would be letting people hang around with us and have a chance to beat us and thats not something we want to do
7510959 theyve adjusted well theyre all on board with what were doing
7510960 weve got a lot of talent power in the lineup
7510961 we just need to hit harder we need to attack with a greater purpose things like that
7510962 i have an interview today wit pgw for their human resources internship position and i put you down as refrence fyi lol thanks

7510967 since the efcc is yet to charge him to court if the counsels were able to get him a bail bargain he may still not have gone home because he still needs to meet the condition for the bail
7510968 we were playing a game to 15 and if anyone had a hitting error before we got to five they lost
7510969 i dont think they were unrealistic challenges but we didnt meet those challenges
7510970 we want to set really high standards for ourselves today we did that and didnt meet them yesterday we did that in the afternoon and we met them its one of those things where its very up
7510971 this is our team motto prevail finding a way against any team to prevail
7510972 we have some work to do for sure but we have a week to do it
7510973 even though we havent played a match yet we would be letting people hang around with us and have a chance to beat us and thats not something we want to do
7510974 theyve adjusted well theyre all on board with what were doing
7510975 weve got a lot of talent power in the lineup
7510976 we just need to hit harder we need to attack with a greater purpose things like that right now were just going up note email address will not be published
7510977 in the summertime we all were committed to working out together and we had team activities that brought our team together
7510978 i think thats going to help us later on down the road when it counts late in the season
7510979 we do a lot of stuff in the off season together and all the guys just hang out
7510980 we cook out we go swimming meet up and just go out bowling and stuff like that
7510981 before we had people on the team who would do their own thing get in trouble or cause trouble now those people are gone so theres a lot more class on the team thats going to help on the field because in those tough situations thats when we need that character
7510982 i couldnt sit here and say its one person because there are a lot of vocal leaders on our team thats going to give our team more balance because offensive players talk to defensive players and defensive players talk to offensive players
7510983 i think that the team coming together actually started all the way back last spring
7510984 they had a great spring practice and then this summer was the best ive ever been around
7510985 they were here every day this summer and they were holding each other accountable
7510986 they worked their tails off so they carried that over into camp its a close group
7510987 to presume kennedy is coming and make preparations on the basis of him coming
7510988 voters are divided over whether mccain would continue bushs policies thats one reason why mccain is competitive imagine what this election would look like if george w bush were running for re election or vice president dick cheney were running to succeed him
7510989 the republican party and mccain are being by helped by the recent crisis between the republic of georgia and russia anything that heightens concern over national security is likely to be good for mccain
7510990 had a certain network not blown our cover at a certain time the text message would have gone out in the morning 8 a m eastern
7510991 we told people they would find out from us when we decided it was going to get out we decided to send the text out
7510992 some republicans and others suggested that obamas 3 a m et email had been intended as a deliberate swipe at hillary clinton who ran a primary season ad that referenced that hour of the morning to make the case she was more qualified to handle a breaking crisis
7510993 if you cant dazzle them with brilliance baffle them with bs
7510994 i think he will serve obama well and he and obama will make a great team
7510995 are you strong enough to be my man my president
7510996 were trying to get virginia votes locked into baracks column
7510997 if we can win virginia he will be the next president
7510998 its hard to do anything on my own my dad and i do pretty much do everything hand and hand
7510999 but yeah this was definitely more my idea and im taking the lead on this
7511000 sure i could have built a replica for less but you cant match authenticity
7511001 sudanese troops have opened fire inside a darfur refugee camp leaving 27 people dead a rebel group has said some 100 government trucks surrounded the kalma camp home to some 90 000 people who have fled their homes in darfur a rebel spokesman told the bbc there is no independent confirmation of the reports but international sources have been told that sudan wants to disarm the camps residents more than two million people have fled five years of conflict in darfur ahmed abdel shafie who heads a faction of the rebel sudan liberation army told the bbc that the government wants to force people to leave the camp
7511002 this really is a catastrophe people are being killed while the world just watches
7511003 it is not just the flowers but the entire landscape
7511004 several insects butterflies bees are attracted to this flower and one gets to see so many more varieties at this time to sit amid these flowers for some time gives such joy
7511005 if you visit the region after flowering which will continue for over a month you will witness popping sounds
7511006 chinmay is very shy and this exposure was good for him
7511007 i was nervous when the competition was going on and everyone sang very well later my classmates told me that they had seen me on tv i was very happy
7511008 every time i see these contests i feel you dont have to see any more soaps to get the viewership the programmers are resorting to melodrama
7511009 even if you win which happens to one in many hundreds of contestants you are forgotten after a while reality shows are now a stale commodity all the shows are the same and have participants singing or dancing to old film songs
7511010 some parents are so ambitious that they need to be counselled we have to tell them to let the children be sometimes parents push the children to wear certain clothes practice some gyrating adult moves at such times we ask them to change their dance
7511011 we have never planned for drama on our show everything is smooth if you follow one simple rule treat the children like your own we have vanity vans for children and their parents shoots are not easy so you have to make it comfortable for them
7511012 it took us nearly two hours from our home to reach the competition venue the schedule went on from 7am till late night it was the same the next day
7511013 the audience segment of four to 14 years is becoming important children are a major influence on consumer behaviour segments like sports music and pure childrens channels have a viewership base which manufacturers of consumer durables auto industries food industry would like to tap
7511014 the new age children on the stage are not anxious and speak for themselves it is important to view childhood from the prism of today and then your entire perspective changes it is a different ball game with different rules
7511015 as long as parents and children know that these competitions are just a part of life and not life itself children will be able to handle the pressures
7511016 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7511017 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7511018 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time
7511019 its not that theres anything wrong with the choice of joe biden a majority of those polled rate the biden selection as excellent or pretty good voters think he is qualified to be president and with the exception of al gore in 1992 the public ranks biden as the most qualified running mate in recent times
7511020 a lot of americans dont know who he is but his favorable rating is 13 points higher than his unfavorables but biden is not hillary clinton and its possible that is enough to have moved some of her supporters away from the democratic ticket at least temporarily
7511021 if some smart person comes along and puts a hole in obama
7511022 heavn has no rage like love to hatred turnd nor hell a fury like a woman scornd
7511023 if some smart person comes along and puts a hole in obama then were stuck with biden

7511037 ive searched for a leader to finish this journey alongside me and to join in me in making washington work for the american people i searched for a leader who understands the rising costs confronting working people and who will always put their dreams first
7511038 a leader who sees clearly the challenges facing america in a changing world with our security and standing set back by eight years of a failed foreign policy a leader who shares my vision of an open government that calls all citizens democrats republicans and independents to a common purpose above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7511039 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7511040 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7511041 the forecast track will keep fay stalled for another 12 to 24 hours before advancing to the northeast into east central mississippi or west central alabama by tuesday morning
7511042 gradual weakening is forecast during the next couple of days
7511043 tropical depression fay is expected to produce rainfall accumulations of 3 to 6 inches over much of alabama portions of mississippi southeastern louisiana western georgia and the florida panhandle through tuesday evening with isolated maximum amounts of 10 inches possible
7511044 regardless of its exact track fay will be moving rather slowly during the next several days posing a significant heavy rainfall and flood hazard to a very large area
7511045 we couldnt understand how certain things and certain information and rumors and all this stuff about me the plagiarizing and that stuff
7511046 we couldnt understand how the hell people knew some of this stuff
7511047 i was the chairman of the judiciary committee but i was running for president of the united states
7511048 senator obamas choice in a running mate once again brings up his questionable judgment when faced with making major decisions
7511049 would be the ideal person for the position i just know this is going to work out
7511050 its really changed how the vice president acts and how hes perceived
7511051 we want to tell them to vote this is a training exercise
7511052 its not going to be 76 000 people sitting somewhere watching a speech
7511053 its going to be 76 000 people attending a speech and they will be turned loose for the next 60 to 70 days
7511054 august 24th 2008 9 22 pm et i am shocked to discover how a nation who is suffering from the hardship of 8 years of bush republicans are still voting for mcain seriously it must be something in the american water air etc what s wrong with you people fight the ignorance and come to the light serously i don t know what to said eduacte yourself
7511055 trust me obama loses this election because of you people hillary will lose in 2012
7511056 take a minute to share a personal note welcoming joe to our movement for change
7511057 it was a brief phone call theyve known each other for many years they are good friends
7511058 americans looking for a pair of candidates who are ready to fix a broken washington arent going to find them on the obama biden ticket
7511059 in joe biden barack obama has not only found a running mate who doesnt believe hes ready to be president hes proven his opposition to an all of the above energy reform strategy to lower fuel costs for families and small businesses
7511060 jeg regner med f mulighet til sightseeing og til ta bilder
7511061 its an opportunity for senator clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for senator obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7511062 yes yes everyone deserves a full vote its the american thing to do
7511063 i congratulate senator barack obama on his selection of my friend senator joe biden to be his vice presidential running mate i have enjoyed for many years the opportunity to work with joe biden to bring strong bipartisan support to united states foreign policy
7511064 i share the disappointment of many hoosiers that my partner in the senate evan bayh was not selected on this occasion but i believe he will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7511065 i believe he will continue to have widespread support for higher office during many years ahead
7511066 in the summer of 2006 as he was publicly mulling the race biden set off a controversy over comments he made about indian americans
7511067 in delaware the largest growth in population is indian americans moving from india you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7511068 been sought by former presidential candidate hillary clinton since shortly after the primary season began
7511069 but you wont live long enough to claim pelosi and other democrats this year 2008 will be always known as hate hate hate for the dems your party as folded you just dont know it yet suckers
7511070 it aint over until the fat head dnc clowns sing their
7511071 it aint over until the dnc sing their swan song
7511072 hillary rodham clinton asked not to be vetted unless she was going to be picked the two officials said speaking on a condition of anonymity to describe the private discussions
7511073 hes too old to be president hes just a little but mentally unbalanced youre not sure what can come out of his mouth on any given day oh and he has a reputation for having a short temper
7511074 why does not hillary clinton run for president as an independant
7511075 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7511076 the reality is that nothing has changed since joe biden first made his assessment that barack obama is not ready to lead he wasnt ready then and he isnt ready now
7511077 slipped with the truth that his own experience is too underwhelming to be president
7511078 at 2004 era comum o pa s crescer 2 5 e no ano seguinte decrescer 1 5 hoje a economia est mais est vel e a perspectiva de crescimento sustentado trouxe seguran a s empresas que passaram a contratar mais e fazer planejamentos de longo prazo
7511079 im delighted senator obama has chosen joe biden as his running mate
7511080 his extensive experience dealing with foreign policy issues are an asset in these complicated times
7511081 jackie and i congratulate our dear friend joe biden who will make an excellent running mate for barack obama and more importantly a great vice president
7511082 i have known joe for almost 30 years and ive had the privilege of sitting next to him on the senate foreign relations committee and sharing the campaign trail both with him and barack i know this is a ticket that can win in november
7511083 joe biden is an outstanding public servant with deep experience and a fighting spirit
7511084 these qualities will make him a great asset in the white house and on the campaign trail this fall
7511085 im delighted senator obama has chosen joe biden as his running mate his extensive experience dealing with foreign policy issues are an asset in these complicated times he will be a great partner for barack obama in bringing about the change so desperately needed in our country and restoring to america our sense of optimism and hope for a brighter future i am proud to support this incredible team
7511086 jackie and i congratulate our dear friend joe biden who will make an excellent running mate for barack obama and more importantly a great vice president
7511087 with rising gas prices increasing health care and education costs a damaged reputation across the world and a struggling economy at home the american people are ready for change barack obama and joe biden represent that change they will bring new leadership to the white house that will get our economy moving again finally end the war in iraq and our bring our troops home ensure that all americans have access to affordable health care and end our dependence on foreign oil
7511088 joe biden is an outstanding public servant with deep experience and a fighting spirit these qualities will make him a great asset in the white house and on the campaign trail this fall
7511089 set aside that obama said shed be on anybodys short list set aside anybodys feelings on whether she was deliberately snubbed and the pros and cons of whether it should be her
7511090 focus on the politics of it and you have about a quarter of clinton loyalists still not joining the caravan for gods sake not to even make a show of taking her seriously is flatly stupid
7511091 you cant put obama vp vetters eric holder and caroline kennedy on an hour plane ride to chappaqua just to check the box they should have done it just for the optics
7511092 barack never even said to her heres how i envision the job not one discussion with her about the position
7511093 they thought her supporters were mad before they are really mad now
7511094 i think there are a lot of hillary voters who are going to say hey wait a minute man you said you were going to put her on the short list
7511095 by the way he didnt seek president clintons advice either hes actually the guy who i think picked the best vice president in american history you would think maybe you would sort of check in with him
7511096 do i do whats best for america or do i spite my country because i am bitter over the result
7511097 i will never vote for obama because my girl hilliary didnt get it
7511098 hillary will have a pretty prominent position in obamas cabinet
7511099 while i attempt to teach my children about trying to do their best in an honest and sportsman like manner and to be a gracious loser all they see and hear are the supporters of senator clinton ranting like the spoiled children i tell my kids to ignore and pity on the playground
7511100 some that are not happy just wait and see what the polls look like in a couple of months
7511101 when my five year doesnt get is way he whines cries and stamps his little feet resulting in a spanking clinton supporters act exactly like little senseless children they whine cry and stamp their little feet because they dont get their way sounds like clinton supporters need a nap or a spanking
7511102 you give your e mail address you fill out a page about yourself and then you can have friends in cyberspace so you can have these groups that organize kids theres messaging that goes on these web sites where theyre told to be at a certain place come to this meeting participate in this way
7511103 im basically asking blakely whos probably getting paid a whole hell of a lot more money than i am to do his damn job
7511104 the main concerns are about the amount of rain that is possibly going to fall in the next 48 hours the predictions are we could have up to 300 millimetres of rain at the moment weve had 75
7511105 the works infrastructure guys whore working on the highway they said theyre barely holding their own at the moment
7511106 te omor tu pizd de te mai vad vreodat cu la

7511108 everyone wants me to fight k fed because hes a notorious celebrity dad and so am i its for charity its serious boxing you have to go get a trainer i have to register with the mature boxing association i dont care who it is its for charity ive been beaten up by the press so i dont care if i get a few shots by a kid half my age
7511109 i want the presidency in the best way not the worst way
7511110 i failed to add that his lack of experience could easily be offset by the presence of well seasoned close advisers
7511111 joe biden has been fighting his entire career for the change that senator obama champions
7511112 he is a dedicated family man who has been an effective chairman of both the foreign affairs and judiciary committees has been a sage voice on many of the toughest foreign policy issues of our time and has long been a strong advocate for protecting american families and making our communities safer
7511113 there has been no harsher critic of barack obamas lack of experience than joe biden
7511114 a perfect voting record from organizations like the veterans of foreign wars the american legion
7511115 look the head of obamas subcommittee within the senate says the guy is not doing a good job
7511116 i dont know its freaky all of the sudden it was like pow wow cindy is calling the shots for john alot of us got really scared shes like an alien or something when she smacked him he went down her expression didnt even change she just said were doing this the room was totally silent that vigorous handshake story was just a cover the sling is real man she popped we had to tell somebody
7511117 i will chase osama bin laden to the gates of hell
7511118 hope hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty the audacity of hope
7511119 the real gamble in this election is playing the same washington game with the same washington players and expecting a different result
7511120 unexperienced seems nobody can alter what they think without flip flopping already had 8 years of someone who wont change what he thinks all presidential candidates are vetted every day by the opposing campaign and the media hillary and bill have been vetted relentlessly for years little need to do it further seems that the same washington players
7511121 i will chase osama bin laden to the gates of hell
7511122 hope hope in the face of difficulty hope in the face of uncertainty the audacity of hope
7511123 i said things that i knew were not in keeping with what i knew was the truth
7511124 commands on foreign policies in vietnam he never did so he is no better than obama or anyone in washington
7511125 how to raise a president 101 for the dems moms to read sad sadly reallized that we cannot have a winnable candidate to beat even the all time worst presidents tale
7511126 die liga hat jetzt die chance endlich wirkungsvolle ma nahmen gegen diese chaoten durchzusetzen bislang kommen sie meist mit zwei oder drei monaten stadionverbot davon man sollte sie aber lebensl nglich f r alle stadien sperren
7511127 dieses verhalten ist peinlich solche leute disqualifizieren sich selbst es f llt auch auf ihren eigenen verein zur ck
7511128 the speaker was never in any danger and she appreciates the quick and professional response of the police
7511129 i dont think obama is ready to be president and when youre commander in chief you shouldnt be having to select a mentor to help you with that role
7511130 it was an honor to be in that final two or three you know i dont think youd be there unless they concluded you had a lot of positive things to offer and probably not too many negatives
7511131 it always seemed like kind of a longshot to me but it was really really nice to be mentioned
7511132 we didnt hire him for his stunning good looks we hired him for his judgment to lead this country if something happens to barack obama and the judgment and the advice that hell give the next president of the united states
7511133 its really a process for me that was wonderful to be part of because i really came away thinking once again that there are so many great people in public service
7511134 john mccain is going to pick somebody next week and the odds are that either that person will have said things about john mccain
7511135 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7511136 the first person that he sat down and talked to at all about this vice presidential issue was senator clinton they had a discussion back in early june about it
7511137 i dont think theres any question at all that the clintons are wholeheartedly behind barack obama they want to see a democrat elected president of the united states
7511138 she ran a fantastic campaign im a huge admirer of hers
7511139 this ad will have a three day life span when hillary clinton speaks on wednesday night she will blow this ad out of the water
7511140 we didnt hire him for his stunning good looks we hired him for his judgment to lead this country
7511141 he had a lot of nice things to say about me which i was very flattered by i told him i was honored to be considered and that i thought joe biden was an excellent man and he could count on me in anyway that i could
7511142 he just said that they were going to be going in a different direction but he said that that was a reflection on other things than me he said a number of things that i would sound immodest if i recounted to you so im not going to do that
7511143 i think any of the people that senator mccain is thinking about for vice president will be more than able to hold their own against senator biden
7511144 american people where obama comes from and what his vision is for the country
7511145 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7511146 it doesnt matter who we pick there isnt going to be any footage or any video of john mccains running mate saying that they would be honored to support barack obama for president because the country would be better off
7511147 biden has been in the senate since obama was 10 years old and obama says he used cocaine and marijuana while he was a young man
7511148 i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character
7511149 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think obamas made a very wise selection
7511150 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but we have been i consider him a good friend and a good man
7511151 and what is this keating five business how come cnn isnt reporting on it
7511152 texas witch twister august 24th 2008 1 05 pm et boy obama does very underhanded thing he can do to keep his name in the limelight eat it up all you can obama because soon you will be a fading nightmare
7511153 dissed for the last time in ma august 24th 2008 2 17 pm et you obama supporters are sick where was john mccain at 1 a m you just dont know how to be civil you are so insecure about your candidate that you must spread your message of hate toward anyone and anything non obama did you ever think it was just a couple of punk kids things like this happen you know if parents had control over their families more crime wouldnt be so rampant

7511158 i know im known for speaking my mind hopefully clearly and strongly
7511159 but i do it on behalf of the middle class
7511160 my plan quite frankly is to roll up my sleeves and do what youve been doing make the phone calls knock on the doors talk to new voters and new supporters face to face
7511161 this campaign has already accomplished so many amazing things for one its cut through the old school partisanship that currently plagues washington
7511162 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7511163 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7511164 she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7511165 it was a song about asking a bartender to create a perfect guy and comparing him to alcohol you can tell where my mind was back then but if im honest with myself it wasnt that bad we even sang it at a few open mics and it was well received
7511166 to be his girlfriend who will be the lucy girl you or me check me out
7511167 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man

7511169 i consider john mccain a good personal friend of mine
7511170 biden who has twice sought the white house is a catholic with a generally liberal voting record and a reputation as a long winded orator across more than 30 years in the senate he has served at various times not only as chairman of the foreign relations committee but also as head of the judiciary committee biden 65 was elected to the senate at the age of 29 in 1973
7511171 you got better things to do guys im not the guy
7511172 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7511173 i will chase osama bin laden to the gates of hell

7511175 keep in mind hillary will have an important cabinet position
7511176 we will get the text letting us know who he picks before anyone else knows it

7511218 while this billboard itself wasnt sexualising children it was placing sex before them
7511219 given what was happening in the community and the senate inquiry into the sexualisation of children in the media we considered that there had been a definite shift in community standards
7511220 there will always be certain hot points within the community that are of concern
7511221 the boards role is to walk the line between advertisers being able to advertise their product and the community not being offended

7511228 on the most basic levels i desire fullness and fleshly lusts seduce me by attaching themselves to this basic desire they exploit the empty spaces in me and they promise that fulness will be mine if i give in to their demands when my soul sits empty and is aching for something to fill it such deceptive promises are extremely difficult to resist consequently the key to mortifying fleshly lusts is to eliminate the emptiness within me and replace it with fullness and i accomplish this by feasting on the gospel indeed it is in the gospel that i experience a god who glorifies himself by filling me with his fullness this is the god of the gospel a god who is satisfied with nothing less than my experience of fullness in him indeed as i perpetually feast on christ and all his blessings found in the gospel i find that my hunger for sin diminishes and the lies of lust simply lose their appeal hence to the degree that i am full i am free eyes do not rove nor do fleshly lusts rule when the heart is fat with the love of jesus

7511274 to sum up to have faith you have to suck
7511275 in an age in which infidelity abounds do we observe them parents carefully instructing their children in the principles of faith which they profess or do they furnish their children with arguments for the defense of the faith they would blush on their childs birth to think him inadequate in any branch of knowledge or any skill pertaining to his station in life he cultivates these skills with becoming diligence but he is left to collect his religion a she may the study of christianity has formed no part of his education his attachment to it where any attachment to it exists at all is too often not the preference of sober reason and conviction instead his attachment to christianity is merely the result of early and groundless possession he was born in a christian country so of course he is a christian his father was a member of the church of england so that is why he is too when religion is handed down among us by hereditary succession it is not surprising to find youth of sense and spirit beginning to question the truth of the system in which they were brought up and it is not surprising to see them abandon a position which they are unable to defend knowing christianity chiefly by its difficulties and the impossibilities falsely imputed to it they fall perhaps into the company of unbelievers

7511278 open spirit of the festival people sit and talk about things candidly in a way they would never do off the street
7511279 can you prove to me that there is a creator
7511280 come on rabbi do you believe the story of jonah is literally true
7511281 its been seven years how can i get over my divorce

7511283 judaism is not only about getting burned in crematoria there is life to it
7511284 auschwitz was not a death camp it was a labor camp
7511285 if so tell me where my grandmother went did she just get lost
7511286 as important as it is for us to speak with jewish people its very important to talk with non jews the young people should see us as normal people and get answers to their questions

7511295 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
7511296 it is not just the flowers but the entire landscape
7511297 several insects butterflies bees are attracted to this flower and one gets to see so many more varieties at this time to sit amid these flowers for some time gives such joy
7511298 if you visit the region after flowering which will continue for over a month you will witness popping sounds
7511299 chinmay is very shy and this exposure was good for him
7511300 i was nervous when the competition was going on and everyone sang very well later my classmates told me that they had seen me on tv i was very happy
7511301 every time i see these contests i feel you dont have to see any more soaps to get the viewership the programmers are resorting to melodrama
7511302 even if you win which happens to one in many hundreds of contestants you are forgotten after a while reality shows are now a stale commodity all the shows are the same and have participants singing or dancing to old film songs
7511303 some parents are so ambitious that they need to be counselled we have to tell them to let the children be sometimes parents push the children to wear certain clothes practice some gyrating adult moves at such times we ask them to change their dance
7511304 we have never planned for drama on our show everything is smooth if you follow one simple rule treat the children like your own we have vanity vans for children and their parents shoots are not easy so you have to make it comfortable for them
7511305 it took us nearly two hours from our home to reach the competition venue the schedule went on from 7am till late night it was the same the next day
7511306 the audience segment of four to 14 years is becoming important children are a major influence on consumer behaviour segments like sports music and pure childrens channels have a viewership base which manufacturers of consumer durables auto industries food industry would like to tap
7511307 the new age children on the stage are not anxious and speak for themselves it is important to view childhood from the prism of today and then your entire perspective changes it is a different ball game with different rules
7511308 as long as parents and children know that these competitions are just a part of life and not life itself children will be able to handle the pressures
7511309 i just felt like i needed to go ahead and do it so it wouldnt affect my team

7511323 one must always take threats seriously both those made by israel and by mr hassan nasrallah because this is a very inflammatory region
7511324 but honestly this time i dont take either side very seriously and i hope i am not mistaken
7511325 if a war were to happen as they are threatening our victory this time will be decisive unquestionable and final

7511327 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against public life
7511328 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens
7511329 our organization is neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7511330 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7511331 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7511332 but we understand the importance of the prisoner issue for palestinian society we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7511333 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7511334 he is our brother and we must struggle to free all prisoners

7511343 we are seekers of peace but there can be no peace without the release of all prisoners and the implementation of all final status issues

7511354 you cant find a more regular guy than joe biden
7511355 he would be the kind of guy you would expect to find in the parish hall in the neighborhood that kind of personality when combined with the kind of reflective christianity barack obama has demonstrated is a winning combination
7511356 every month after kits are sold out i get emails asking me if they are really gone unfortunately yes they are these are hard emails to respond to because i dont like to disappoint people that way but the reality is once theyre gone theyre gone
7511357 a certification of birth also known as a short form birth certificate the long form is drawn up by the hospital and includes additional information such as birth weight and parents hometowns
7511358 the hawaii department of healths birth record request form does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long form birth certificate but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the state department we tried to ask the hawaii doh why they only offer the short form among other questions but they have not given a response
7511359 recently factcheck representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three dimensional and resides at the obama headquarters in chicago
7511360 we couldnt get someone on the phone in hawaii to tell us whether the number represented some secret information and we erred on the side of blacking it out since then weve found out its pretty irrelevant for the outside world
7511361 potentially if you have that number you could break into the system
7511362 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
7511363 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
7511364 aspire one is the must have back to school supply for students
7511365 it always amuses me to see these motorsport magazine evaluations of drivers
7511366 for me you have to take into consideration how long a driver has been in formula one when you evaluate his performance
7511367 for no other reason that puts lewis top of the heap he is the best in formula one at the moment
7511368 if you take into account how little experience he has had thats the bit that gives him the edge
7511369 it doesnt mean to say he is particularly quicker than the others or he has dominated its just you have to take how long they have been involved in the sport as one of the values
7511370 how can you criticise him only a fool doesnt realise that irrespective of age you learn something every day
7511371 it is no different for a racing driver because they spend their whole life driving a racing car and they are going to learn more and more
7511372 with all drivers in formula one they are on a very steep learning curve and the longer they are in it the steeper it becomes
7511373 i wouldnt be surprised if lewis has won more races to grands prix at his age i doubt there has ever been a driver who has won eight of his first 29 races
7511374 i still look back on lewis behaviour after losing the world title
7511375 he took it a hell of a lot better than i did and more than many other people in the company
7511376 i dont think he used his inexperience as a crutch at all so on the sunday evening after brazil my admiration for him went up a significant amount
7511377 what can you do you cant take it the wrong way
7511378 i think the most important thing about it is that i keep putting myself in a good position and unfortunately somebody just seems to be able to come up with some spectacular playing when im out there on top
7511379 i hit a great putt it just snuck in on the left side and i knew at that time that obviously vijay still had to putt but i had a chance and for sure i wasnt going to be out of the play off
7511380 i knew it had a chance i mean if hes 10 feet away you know that hes probably going to make it
7511381 obviously he still had a shot at it the same way i made it he can do it and he did
7511382 and then he followed it unbelievably holed that putt after i did and then he just played a really solid 17th hole you know again he did it in regulation and he played it pretty much exactly the same way in the play off
7511383 so unfortunately it just didnt work out he just hit two great shots on 17
7511384 i felt like i played solid all week i got a couple of bad breaks here and there that maybe would have made the difference and a couple of good ones here and there too
7511385 at the end of the day i had a shot thats what you ask yourself for and vijay just came out with the goods and youve just got to give hats off to him
7511386 obviously this was a good start not the perfect start obviously but it was a very good start
7511387 now ive just got to make sure i am fit and healthy for the next few games
7511388 we will discuss how long im going to play against coventry but obviously oba martins has now got an injury and we will just have to wait and see
7511389 i had a bad illness over the summer but i could have been really unlucky and had it during the season thankfully ive just missed one game though it seems like i have been away for ages
7511390 your game changes over the years when i started i suppose i scored one in 50 headers and now every other goal seems to be from my head
7511391 its going to be a tough place to go but it should be a good game
7511392 coventry have started off well i know they were beaten on saturday but they started off with six points from the first two games and they have got a guy who i really respect in charge there chris coleman who i brought to fulham
7511393 they are a club that are looking to build and go places and their ambition is to be in the league we are in
7511394 it is a good test for us in a competition we will take very seriously
7511395 it is one of two chances if we are honest we can win the fa cup and we can win the carling cup they are definitely the two chances

7511399 i think he was wrongly convicted but i respect the jurys decision
7511400 pleased that the jury recognized that mr marsalis is a criminal a sexual offender
7511401 we had hoped that he would be found guilty of all the charges
7511402 but our primary focus was first and foremost on the well being of the victims in the case
7511403 it is very difficult to come into an open courtroom and have to talk about the worst experiences of your life we really respect the women for doing that
7511404 marsalis was found not guilty in january 2006 of drugging and raping three other women
7511405 if he is found not guilty he faces another drugging and rape case in sun valley idaho he is alleged to have assaulted a woman in october 2005 while he was awaiting trial here in a similar drugging and rape case he was later found not guilty in the previous philadelphia case
7511406 marsalis 34 faces up to 20 years in prison for the two counts of sexual assault defined as intercourse without consent rape includes aggravating factors such as force
7511407 das bedeutet auch dass wir ihr kabinett best tigen werden

7511500 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7511562 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7511563 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7511564 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7511565 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7511566 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7511568 de klacht heeft betrekking op het product iphone 3g en de verkoopspraktijk en het is aan de algemene directie om uit te maken wie hierin de verantwoordelijkheid draagt
7511569 voor ons is het immers niet duidelijk waar en in welke mate apple dan wel mobistar hier in de fout gaat
7511570 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7511571 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7511572 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7511573 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7511574 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7511575 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7511576 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7511577 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica

7511618 says that the us senator joseph biden has reasonable visions toward iraq and kurdistan nominating him to the vice president position of the us has its significant on kurds and iraqi issues
7511619 its time to put force on the table and use it
7511620 the reminder was vague oh the lesson so glorious our hearts were made for a much higher purpose
7511621 this is the worst air disaster in recent years we have never faced such a tragedy
7511622 at one moment we could not breathe at all because our lungs were burning
7511623 i am still not convinced he is dead although he is not among the survivors
7511624 clearly they have chosen the path of arrogance unilateralism thats a serious blow to confidence building in the talks
7511625 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7511626 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7511627 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7511628 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7511629 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7511632 there is a lot of history of players that had this condition that he had at the combine that have played with it
7511633 we were basing it off of the play time we were basing it off of no symptoms for a period of three or more years we were comfortable with that i did use the term wear and tear there were concerns but you know what you could say that for a lot of players at a lot of positions
7511634 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7511635 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7511636 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7511637 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7511638 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7511639 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7511646 it doesnt matter really what my definition of rich is
7511647 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
7511648 some thinks you are special and has a hot crush on you
7511649 a girl came up to me on the street and she almost smacked me
7511650 i dont think it would be overstating things to say that this will result in lives being put at risk and may even result in deaths mr cruickshank said
7511651 milford sound is an isolated community and all our plans for emergency response including searches evacuations and resupply missions rely on aircraft being able to refuel there
7511652 wed rather get this sorted now than have some inquiry post disaster when it becomes clear that it would have been good to still have this facility
7511653 i the undersigned ask you to investigate the situation in te anau st johns have acted arbitrarily against the community volunteers and area committee and are appointing a full time paid ambulance officer
7511654 i feel like a pee wee herman when i have my pants up
7511655 when we go to church or have a job interview or go to school we want to look presentable
7511656 but we dont want to walk around looking like a teacher all day
7511657 well if there is a block like this in jacksonville then there must be one in every american city
7511658 imagine all the trouble and fun i could cause all at once just with a text on my blackberry from me to them and because i had so much fun doing this one i decided i need to find my new british bff everyone knows i love la but london watch out
7511659 my goal was to bring myself and my personality into this project
7511660 as i speak to you now nobody knows when the cabinet will be reshuffled the president knows exactly what he is doing against what he wants to achieve he knows the ministers capability individually having served under him for about a year now he knows those the nation needs and will do just that he does his things very carefully and the result is always good
7511661 nigeria produces almost 45 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions in africa from its gas flaring by oil firms in the niger delta while south africa produces as much from industrial pollution
7511662 nigeria emits 20 billion cubic metres of gas flares annually accounting for 13 percent of the global 150 billion cubic metres of gas flares every year and making it second in the world after russia
7511663 the emissions from nigeria and south africa huge as they seem can by no means compare to the emissions from the industrialised countries the countries should do something about them at least for the sake of their immediate communities
7511664 this explains why south africa insists that developed countries should take the lead in emissions reduction before developing nations cut down their own emissions
7511665 it doesnt make sense for nigeria and south africa for instance to reduce their emissions while the industrialised nations who are largely responsible for climate change do not make any efforts to reduce theirs
7511666 the atmosphere is a common space for all and our emissions are infinitesimal compared to those in developed countries
7511667 we lack confidence in his continued leadership of the commission and hereby demand his immediate removal
7511668 no doubt it is an obvious plan for unprecedented rigging of election
7511669 the efforts of government and various stakeholders have succeessfully brought down the hiv prevalence rate of our state from 5 7 per cent in 2003 to 5 5 per cent in 2005
7511670 as an ngasman his ability to perform creditably is not in doubt nde dimka has the clout the integrity the exposure and the commitment needed for the exalted office of ssg
7511671 it is our prayers that god gives you the wisdom and strengthen your resolve to join the governor in providing good governance for our people
7511672 in the past couple of years of our joint accession to the european union we have found additional things for closer cooperation
7511673 next month or during october the foreign ministers of poland denmark and the republic of cyprus will meet here nicosia to prepare our common efforts and common action during the joint presidency of the union
7511674 we are looking forward to next year for some high level visits by the president of the republic and the president of the house of representatives to warsaw
7511675 problems have been resolved in cooperation with the minister of the interior the minister of labour and the chief of the cyprus police
7511676 the icpc should embark on leadership training programmes for leaders to make them transformational leaders and agents of change thereby influencing their followers to positive and ethical behaviors
7511677 the reversal of the illegal promotion is not because of ribadu or any of the 139 officers for what it is not victimisation what about iwendi what had he done wrong or who has he victimised it is not about ribadu we are talking about moral issue of people who are not due for promotion but got it illegally without due process this reversal is the best thing that has ever happened to restore discipline and confidence in the police force
7511678 we were of its national security implications and therefore challenge the pdp to go the whole hog by exposing the foreign entities involved and details of the plot
7511679 cnpp also wishes to reassure nigerians that nud is not working with my foreign group either overtly or covertly and subscribes to the truism that democracy remains the best form of government specially where the sanctity of the ballot box is upheld and the primary of the peoples vote counts
7511680 she gave the directive for the prosecution of the officer not only as a break from the past when such officers were allowed to go without trial but more importantly to send a strong signal to those who may want to use the name of the commission to commit crime
7511681 the reality though is that the fight against corruption poses grave and unpredictable risks to those who dare to challenge this gargantuan monster
7511682 we must expect resistance from well entrenched beneficiaries of the existing system
7511683 protagonists of the anti corruption crusade should not expect to be congratulated by powerful existing interests in spite of great odds however i strongly believe that the battle against corruption can be won in our lifetime in nigeria
7511684 the greater part of the nigerian problem is the ruling elite selfish greedy unpatriotic and often lawless
7511685 it is a crime against humanity depriving citizens of education employment opportunities health care water food roads and electric power grand corruption has denied nigeria every opportunity for economic advancement
7511686 today we have over 7 5 million beneficiaries of microfinance bank loans in bangladesh
7511687 the advantage of the loans given to these poor was that majority of the wards of the beneficiaries are now graduates who run their own businesses without looking for job from the government
7511688 the over all goal of the comprehensive strategy adopted by the state government on the prevention and control of the non communicable diseases in the state is to detect early asymptomatic undiagnosed cases especially those at high risk as well as to prevent complications through the prompt and effective treatment of diagnosed cases

7511707 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7511708 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7511709 the surrender of the suicide bomber indicates that the iraqis are continuing to reject al qaeda and its practices
7511710 they were having the feast when a stranger walked in and blew himself up it is a criminal act i cannot believe that a muslim man could do it

7511715 we understand that there is another child but we were unaware at the birth of the child that there was an issue so we did not have the opportunity to act
7511716 were very concerned that the health of both of these children is monitored and that the little baby in particular can be vaccinated
7511717 weve had some phone contact with them from time to time and obviously each time were urging them to come forward
7511718 the incidences of acute reactions to the hepatitis b vaccine are extremely rare and if they do occur they are usually short lived
7511719 so if youre weighing up the risks of vaccination versus not vaccination then we would certainly recommend vaccination

7511791 the semiconductor industry is the epitome of high tech but we need to integrate low tech programs for factories to perform these low tech best practices are a critical component of manufacturing and we should apply methodologies for improvement from other industries in our case weve seen huge improvement in people productivity quality cost and cycle time using a largely unconventional approach

7511810 use phonic knowledge to write simple regular words and make phonetically plausible attempts at more complex words
7511811 its not about introducing a curriculum for young children or making them read or write before theyre ready quite the reverse
7511812 learning and development requirements that all early years providers must by law deliver
7511813 the early learning goals which young children should have acquired by the end of the academic year in which they reach five
7511814 the matters skills and processes which are required to be taught to young children
7511815 it makes a point of mentioning the welfare requirements but the statutory learning requirements which have caused so much disagreement and dissent are noticeable by their absence
7511816 there is plenty in the statutory framework that both parents and practitioners have taken strong and principled issue with because of its developmental inappropriateness
7511817 but in stark contrast there is pretty much nothing that any parent or practitioner would take issue with in this parents booklet
7511818 the booklet seems to amount to little more than a propaganda exercise specially launched by the department for children schools and families and designed to head off any parents revolt about the eyfs
7511819 hsbc has become embroiled in a race row after it dressed up an overweight white man to look like a japanese sumo wrestler for its latest advert
7511820 the fact that the picture depicts a sumo wrestler who is not actually a sumo wrestler but has been made up to look like one would be considered a high insult to the japanese community
7511821 some of the spirit of self negation self discipline sense of humour responsibility helpfulness to others loyalty and patriotism which go to make character
7511822 the reason we find the concept of character difficult is because of class conflict in british society
7511823 there was a sense that good character was handed down from a patrician class to the great unwashed
7511824 a refusal to make judgments about what is good and bad behaviour right and wrong
7511825 a young student ponders whether to spend the evening revising at her desk or to go out with friends how much to sacrifice tonight for a remote future when to stop having fun but also when to stop being serious conventions expectations and institutions have built up gradually over decades and centuries to form a stock of equipment available to deal with her problem sources and strategies of self control both cognitive and social take time to develop
7511826 over time poverty has become more associated with differences in character development
7511827 so while in the past a poor deprived child would have about the same chance of developing a good character as a more affluent one our research suggests that children who were born into deprivation in the 1970s as opposed to the late 1950s were much less likely to develop good character than more affluent groups
7511828 theres an interaction between your genetic predisposition and the way you turn out according to the way youre raised
7511829 when it comes to being antisocial aggressive stealing and lying the interaction is a big one if you have poor self control and a rather twitchy irritable temperament and youre brought up in a harsh way its bad news for that group the rate of criminality aged 17 is about 40 but if you have that twitchy character and youre brought up in a reasonably calm soothing way you will do well
7511830 financial poverty is a factor but not a central one
7511831 i am fond of saying poverty of what and actually it seems to be poverty of the parent child experience that leads to poor child outcomes rather than poverty of a material kind
7511832 the danger is that many people in deprived areas are being denied work because of a lack of cultural capital
7511833 in glasgow 50 of jobs are now filled by commuters from the middle class suburbs
7511834 it is regular time with the same adult over an extended period so you respect them and learn from them which is why things like the scout movement are so effective because youre progressing youre ageing through the institution and there tends to be a very good staying on rate for the adult workers so you have a lot of interaction with the same adult over a long period of time
7511835 no englishman can open his mouth without causing another englishman to despise him
7511836 this house will in no circumstances fight for king and country
7511837 the object in life is not to be on the side of the majority but to escape finding oneself in the ranks of the insane
7511838 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was garcia said
7511839 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7511840 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7511841 its a great golf course said singh the 1993 1995 and 2006 winner at westchester
7511842 westchester was a good golf course this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course
7511843 i think he was surprised to make his singh said
7511844 i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7511845 oh yeah definitely everybody thats playing the fedexcup wants to win i mean i want to win as much as anybody else but that doesnt prove that im going to win it i have to go out there and do it thats what im looking forward to
7511846 you cant take it the wrong way i think the most important thing about it is that i keep putting myself in a good position and unfortunately somebody just seems to be able to come up with some spectacular playing when im out there on top
7511847 i feel like i played solid all week i got a couple bad breaks here and there that maybe would have made the difference and a couple good ones here and there too at the end of the day i had a shot thats what you ask yourself for and vijay came out with the goods and youve just got to give hats off to him
7511848 you know its hard hes sergio garcia a good friend of mine its hard to see him its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7511849 yeah obviously you want to win and for this week it was even more special with everything that happened in spain with the plane crash and with my godmother losing her brother on monday i really wanted to win and dedicate the victory to everybody in spain i hope they feel good about the second place and i definitely gave it my best shot
7511850 it was not where my ball was but like about five or six feet left the ground was actually moving
7511851 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at the moment you could see him popping out
7511852 in the process of trading up and down dramatically last week it has become clear that only one factor really matters right now
7511853 big money investors have turned oil into a proxy for the u s dollar
7511854 we continue to see little chance for oil to be used by russia as a bargaining tool
7511855 oil is the weapon of last resort not of first resort and it would make no sense for russia to limit exports of crude or products to european countries

7511928 scotland should always be a stand alone nation at whatever i believe
7511929 i said well i think its terrific but i had no idea what local repercussions would be
7511930 my first response was i couldnt see anything but benefits for that part of scotland because its pretty neglected apart from the oil fields
7511931 originally the event was set up part to dispel the myth that arose after the 1980s that gay men and women were not healthy after the emergence of hiv aids
7511932 it was also a great opportunity for gay men and women to diversify and take part in activities with like minded people but taking part for the love of their game not their sexual preference
7511933 many gay people were disenfranchised from sport due to homophobia this kind of event helps create a safe and tolerant environment for people to play and express themselves
7511934 homophobia is still rife in football and football is not well respected in the gay community
7511935 we are not expected to win it would be nice if we can put in some good performances get a goal or two and try to avoid going out on penalties again
7511936 we describe ourselves as a community based club where everyone is welcome to join us regardless of status or ability
7511937 this includes having mixed gender teams which is a strong statement against what we as a club see as blatant sex discrimination by the fa who do not allow mixed football past the age of 11
7511938 our philosophy is reflected by now having in place a constitution that operates with strong policies covering equality inclusion safety welfare and confidentiality
7511939 the championship offers a chance to show the uk and the rest of the world that this community is committed to equality and inclusion offering a place where everyone can participate in sport safely and without discrimination
7511940 it also offers a platform to challenge homophobia in football and beyond

7511943 uday has strong client experience in international tax transfer pricing foreign investment consulting and exchange control regulations that will further strengthen our position as we move forward in achieving our business objectives
7511944 companies operating internationally are discovering that their transfer pricing positions may face challenges from one tax authority even when that position is well supported and accepted by other tax authorities operating under the umbrella of the oecd guidelines
7511945 a companys priority might be to limit conflicts with tax authorities to improve predictability in financial statements to manage the effective tax rate or to meet cash flow targets
7511946 the company will likely try to balance a number of these objectives the important thing is to have a clear and well supported rationale for the decisions that are made
7511947 they started to yell at him and then shove him and then started to throw rocks at him
7511948 he called for reinforcements which arrived in the form of two more rangers who were also attacked then they called me and i drove in they threw rocks at my car and damaged the windshields
7511949 i managed to get the principal into the car and away from the students and they started to calm down the police came and we filed a complaint against the students
7511950 this is the first time ive ever encountered such behavior from that particular sector of the population
7511951 it is generally a pleasure to deal with the religious and haredi populations they like to hike and usually all we have to worry about is rescuing them sometimes they hike a lot sukkot pesach between semesters in yeshivas but ive never encountered anything like this
7511952 one of the rangers was a beduin another was a woman but they also attacked me and i am neither a beduin nor a woman so i dont know
7511953 in the last few years we feel very threatened i used to take my gun when i was going into dangerous areas like border areas now i even take my gun into ein gedi the most popular and quietest reserve in israel

7512115 we have to ask the question whether there seems to be an acceptance that if another black youth is killed they are just another one that we dont have to worry about
7512116 black youths within this country have been left to die and thats a very strong statement but its a statement that seems to be borne out through evidence about black youths who seem to be at the top of the list when it comes to our youngsters being killed
7512117 now were asking very serious questions of national government and local government as to why it seems that resources that have been allocated for community cohesion and other activities have not been going to those organisations
7512118 the government is committed to tackling gun gang and knife crime and getting weapons off our streets

7512131 according to the yukpa the aggressors were hired by elite landowners to evict the indigenous population from the vast largely idle pastures in the region known as the sierra de perij near venezuelas northwestern border with colombia
7512132 the attacks were the latest and largest in a string of attempts to intimidate and terrorize a yukpa community since they intensified their land recuperation efforts over the past year by occupying 14 privately owned estates known as haciendas
7512133 they arrived quietly and hit me over the neck with their guns and hit me in the back they grabbed me by the hair and dragged me and asked for sabino yelling dirty words and saying they are going to kill me
7512134 yukpa leaders say the government quietly placed the controversial land demarcation initiative on the political back burner last year presumably in order to minimize conflict in the runup to this novembers regional and local elections
7512135 in addition land demarcation officials demand geographical and agricultural information that can only be obtained with the cooperation of the powerful and violent hacienda owners thus yukpa leaders say they have no choice but to trespass on the lands that were stolen from their grandparents over the course of the 20th century
7512136 as tension mounts the government led by president hugo ch vez faces the decision of whether to expel the yukpa in defense of private property in this semi fuedal zone or comply with its own land titling initiative by giving collective land titles to the yukpa compensating the current owners and protecting the yukpa from mercenary attacks

7512142 more important though he said that the new owners would likely be able to invest in upgraded technology such as fibre optic wiring to households or the wireless network that in turn will help increase canadian productivity improved wiring to canadian homes would allow bell canada to deliver faster internet service to its customers and allow it to keep pace with their cable company rivals
7512143 if you polled the average guy on the street who knew anything about buyouts theyd say oh my gosh bell is going to stop investing the neat thing about this announcement is that thats absolutely not the case
7512144 were investing with discipline in growing markets and where we know we can win competitively
7512145 given the dropping cost of fibre gear bells decision is surprising
7512146 it may be an attempt to keep operations simple by holding back on new technology

7512210 we are really pleased to be working with eci a pioneering and nationally renowned chronic care management company that specializes in truly integrating the patient with the physician and health care team as well as the patients caregivers eci has built its reputation for superb outcomes management in part on timely accurate and comprehensive data and we believe that our med expert system will significantly expand ecis capabilities in this regard

7512213 the boards opinion is that our current share price is not representative of its true value and that following the exchange these shares should be trading at higher levels our company is going through several significant transitions including the recent agreement with cinergy health a large nationwide health plan company headquartered in florida we agree that a share exchange program is in the best interests of eruc and its shareholders
7512214 in addition to the strong efforts we are making to grow our market value by building our business through expansion and aggressive promotion and strategic contracts we believe that removing as much as half our shares can help grow our value exponentially we are just getting started
7512215 we are committed to enhancing shareholder value and expanding our corporate visibility and corporate image to a broader investor community we believe that our recent investor relations initiatives will assure that our compelling story reaches a larger investor audience

7512218 two kimberlites have already been discovered in outcrop prior to any drilling and one of these has proved to be highly diamondiferous the presence of 12 diamonds above the 0 600 mm sieve size in a cumulative sample of only 195 kg suggests a coarse diamond size distribution at ch 1 which is normally an indication that a population of commercial sized diamonds will be identified in larger samples an additional one tonne sample from ch 1 has been collected and will be sent to src for processing immediately and the field crew is currently collecting samples from ch 2 we view these developments as highly encouraging at this stage of exploration and we expect that more diamondiferous kimberlites will be discovered at chidliak in the future
7512219 the identification to date of over 65 kimberlite type geophysical anomalies combined with the tonnage potential demonstrated by the first two kimberlite discoveries illustrates the superb diamond potential of this property further geophysical anomalies associated with the best kimberlite indicator mineral chemistry on the property have yet to be tested chidliak will be a major focus of the companys activity in 2009 and we are confident that we will be able to build upon these strong results
7512220 the results received from the falcon were very welcome in that the final outcome met our expectations after a thorough and extensive review of several potential recovery processes we view the implementation of the falcon as an integral step before increasing production levels to 300 tpd and we believe this to currently be the best alternative for achieving our goal of increased gold and silver recoveries plant infrastructure is now in place for the upgrade to 300 tpd operational processes are being refined and we are building towards a mine plan that will position the company for long term sustainable mining at increased production levels from the current levels we are producing today
7512221 these additional funds will assist us in expanding and accelerating our development work program at the florida 4 vein system and to pay for the new upgraded requirements to the tailings area of the project this unexpected and significant additional cost to upgrade our tailings area was just recently required by the regulatory authority semarnat and may require additional funds in the coming months we anticipate the increase and acceleration of development work at florida 4 will allow the company to produce the required tonnage to increase production levels to 300 tpd while simultaneously maintaining accurate grade control we expect that the increase to 300 tpd combined with accelerated development of the florida 4 vein system and other areas will generate positive cash flow this cash flow can then be reinvested into further exploration and development work at the companys mina real and santa fe properties allowing the company to fully develop the potential of its projects and continue its business plan of increasing production levels beyond current and planned levels

7512254 celtic christians had a name for the holy spirit an geadh glas or the wild goose the name hints at mystery much like a wild goose the spirit of god cannot be tracked or tamed an element of danger an air of unpredictability surround him and while the name may sound a little sacrilegious i cannot think of a better description of what its like to follow the spirit through life i think the celtic christians were on to something most of us will have no idea where we are going most of the time and i know that is unsettling but circumstantial uncertainty also goes by another name adventure

7512271 some people start drinking at 15 if you lower the age to 18 younger people are probably going to start
7512272 i think if you changed it it would encourage young people to drink more
7512273 its scary now i think about what could have happened to me at that age i dont think i was ready yet
7512274 as much as it would seem cool to lower the age to 18 i think it would just make it easier for people to buy liquor
7512275 but when we had parties wed all just stay over at that persons house now everyone drinks and drives

7512332 increased demand for better quality and better located dwellings rather than for more dwellings has been the primary driver
7512333 it is demographic nonsense to believe that immigration can help to keep our population young
7512334 the level of net overseas migration is important as net inflows of migrants to australia reduce the rate of population ageing because migrants are younger on average than the resident population just under 70 of the migrant intake are in the 15 44 age cohort compared to 43 of the australian population as a whole just 10 of the migrant intake are 45 or over compared with 38 of the australian population
7512335 more than half are aged 15 to 34 compared with 28 per cent of our population
7512336 net benefit to the economy is a lot more clear cut
7512337 several major capital works projects had to be put on hold because there were not enough skilled and unskilled workers
7512338 there is no evidence that immigration has negatively impacted on the wages of young or low skilled natives
7512339 its true that immigrants add to the supply of labour
7512340 the only solution for countries that continue to be concerned about a future with declining and aging populations is to open their gates to immigration
7512341 free from discrimination based on race religion gender nationality or country of origin
7512342 environmentally australia is near her carrying capacity economically immigration is unsustainable and socially if continued as is will lead to an ethnically divided australia

7512350 sei la luce che illumina le mie notti buie irradi la mia vita di essa sei una stella che brilla di luce propria e ne ragala agli altri ed il mio primo pensiero al mattino e lultimo alla sera
7512351 sei la luce che illumina le mie notti buie irradi la mia vita di essa sei una stella che brilla di luce propria e ne ragala agli altri ed il mio primo pensiero al mattino e lultimo alla sera
7512352 if you have to decide between a really terrific european cellist and a really good american cellist you lean to american
7512353 but with all the visa malarkey and trying to get guest artists into the country with enough confidence to include them in our season brochure well we are looking at more american artists
7512354 its not a deal killer but if you have to decide between a really terrific european cellist and a really good american cellist you lean to american which is good for the american but its another step for our bookkeeping department and we have only so much time
7512355 we canceled a guest conductor for next season for the exchange rate were looking at a chinese conductor instead of a european one
7512356 she played all the different instruments for us and she was a violinist and didnt necessarily know how to play the cello
7512357 she went to bow the low string and it made an awful noise which i loved
7512358 pompeii and the roman villa art and culture around the bay of naples
7512359 nobody i met all through the years can blow the sax like he can
7512360 if people like tony werent around i dont know where jazz would be
7512361 hes been a mentor to many people in his lifetime
7512362 you have a chance to express it how you want to where you come from how you jumped rope it all gets in there
7512363 this music gives you freedom to express yourself everybody that breathes can have something to say
7512364 he would always tell me i want you to listen and see what you get out of it i learned a whole lot by just listening
7512365 bill was a good drummer but he was always clowning so they fired him
7512366 but i had a family and i felt they needed structure
7512367 people would try to steal him but he has roots here
7512368 like bootsie barnes they could have been international in a heartbeat but for 100 reasons they stayed local
7512369 philadelphia has been wonderful to me i used to hear people say you cant make it unless you go away from your home well i broke that tradition
7512370 ive had a chance to do my music and the people have been gloriously nice and supportive life has been really good if i were to pass the picket line right now i would not feel sorry for myself
7512371 we were sick and tired of all those boom boxes and this loud music we wanted to keep jazz alive
7512372 we said look if we want to hear some good music we have to be sure it exists
7512373 kids who might be banging on the table wanting to play drums or singing or just excited by the music
7512374 i had never heard anything like that before when you hear a style thats so expressive it just fascinates you
7512375 i get a great satisfaction out of a kid starting out with nothing and then he picks up a trombone he picks up a sax and he plays a song and surprises me
7512376 young people pass on their energy i dont mess with old folks too much
7512377 hes amazing when playing with him even just trading measures i go to another level
7512378 sometimes i thought i dont want to get up but id get up
7512379 the praise and applause you got when you got there was worth it
7512380 you expect him to be toddling but not tony hes always got something going on
7512381 we dont know what were going to play we could play anything
7512382 someone could walk in you havent seen in 15 years but you remember them and you play a song you know they like
7512383 when a musician like tony can give you a particular song be it a standard or a pop song or a jazz tune and play it for you 100 times and each time its different without reading a piece of music thats magnificent
7512384 sometimes they come out and they dont know whats going on theyre by themselves they look uptight when i see that i try to make an expression at them so they feel at home
7512385 the camaraderie is great and the music seems to be good according to the applause
7512386 if you have a problem you dont think about it if you were feeling sad you dont any longer its a gift
7512387 if you got the weed i got the pipe we can get high together all night
7512388 this year folks youre not going to have to settle for their overpromising graphics and underperforming anchors cause this year you can settle for ours
7512389 well bring you all the news stories first before its even true
7512390 and they still do but in many ways there arent a lot of surprises in political conventions anymore
7512391 were not c span they perform a public service but we provide more than that
7512392 i did this without her permission and it was wrong
7512393 this is a man obsessed with taking a woman down
7512394 shocking and shows the true lack of remorse which the judge should take into consideration at sentencing
7512395 he continues his attack on the victim with unfounded implications
7512396 larry mendte like all cbs3 employees was treated professionally and fairly during his tenure here his allegations are totally without merit
7512397 to your knowledge is everything he said accurate and correct
7512398 we will not make a specific recommendation as to what sentence the court should impose
7512399 are you pleading guilty because you are in fact guilty as charged
7512400 i do not intend to do anything at this time until i hear the judges sentence
7512401 what were going to do regarding larry and his employer
7512402 the writer of the anonymous letter had to be aware of the suggestion for community service by the district attorneys office and of lanes resistance to the suggestion
7512403 i ask that this long mutually self destructive feud now end we have both paid a high cost and others have been hurt as well i am sorry to all
7512404 did all these various activities i encountered really represent a movement
7512405 the answer to that for now has to be somewhat ambiguous
7512406 the only thing jews and cowboys have in common is we both like to wear our hats indoors
7512407 so ride ride em jewboy ride em all around the old corral im im with you boy if ive got to ride 6 million miles
7512408 i was certainly as shocked and amazed as anybody to find it had been removed and was in new york
7512409 i have to say that it never even occurred to me that it could be removed or moved never
7512410 mitchell is the link between the scientific community and the artistic community which is where eakins lived too
7512411 and shes about three shades lighter taking the years of grime off her completely transformed her
7512412 that the rotten acts human beings commit against one another are not just aberrations theyre an essential part of who we are
7512413 she wouldnt be crying herself to sleep every other night
7512414 that i had never truly inhabited myself that i had never been real
7512415 think dark and go down into it see it through to the end
7512416 coining phrases in the middle of the night making up stories in the middle of the night
7512417 were moving on my darlings and agonizing as this mess can be theres poetry in it too as long as you can find the words to express it assuming those words exist
7512418 chopped off arms in africa chopped off heads in iraq and america cracking apart the noble experiment finally dead
7512419 put your hand on my face and talk to me
7512420 but if you accept my offer i think we should start with a comedy
7512421 i came here the day after finishing the martin scorsese
7512422 i just had the flight time between the two filming schedules essentially thats how its working out its pretty well back to back right now
7512423 which is great because the variety of work i can choose to do now is stupendous i can choose to do a film like
7512424 i can also really allow myself to push the parameters of recklessness in my work i dont mean in my discipline but i do mean in the performance although im absolutely word perfect on the text i did allow myself to be a lot looser and more reckless in
7512425 and i can also choose to play a silly little role like in
7512426 for the most part if you look at my cv
7512427 very often im either the moral center of the film or the political center of the film but to be part of the comedic half of the film as in
7512428 so those four films in philadelphia pretty well represent what im allowed to do now what i allow myself to do and the great position i find myself in which is having these wonderful choices so i say yes i can do that for mike myers that would be wonderful as well as of course doing this immensely committed and dedicated role with penelope in elegy
7512429 there was no accent there is no disguise the clothes i wore could have been mine
7512430 its the closest that ive ever been to sounding and looking like me
7512431 but in order to be challenged by the role and feel the danger in playing him i had to get out of my suit of armor i had to get out of my actors disguise tricks so that was a constant challenge hearing my own voice coming out of my head saying those lines
7512432 i think for me the sustained difficulty was not to judge the character nor to sentimentalize him but ushering him up exactly as he is to the audience and let them accept him without any filtering of my judgment
7512433 so i had to be free of any judgment of him positive or negative and as i say to remove as many layers as possible through which to filter him
7512434 she brings a female essence to a tale of a man and a woman
7512435 people cant quite always get past the sexual politics in some fiction you know if one were writing a biography about hitler it wouldnt necessarily mean that youre a fascist but you do have to explore that mind set
7512436 the face was vaguely familiar and after a moment keller realized it was supposed to be ann coulter keller thought that was about the saddest thing hed ever seen in his life
7512437 where the ten commandments werent so much broken as hacked to pieces with a knife
7512438 i stuffed some clothes in a bag hopped in my galaxie and sped south across the malformed mutant offspring of brooklyn known as staten island the forgotten fifth borough the cultural void home of the world famous ferry the worlds largest garbage dump and the worlds largest collection of identical people
7512439 one of only three man made objects along with the egyptian pyramids and the great wall of china visible from outer space
7512440 that when he died id feel some satisfaction or at least some relief i thought id feel a thousand pounds lighter id grow six inches taller walk different breathe different all this space would open up in the world just from knowing he wasnt in it anymore
7512441 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7512442 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7512443 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7512444 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7512445 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7512446 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids

7512462 there are other things he has to take into consideration the money and his contract with fox
7512463 but if the giants really want him they have a shot
7512464 would i like michael to be a new york giant this season absolutely absolutely
7512465 will he be i have no idea i dont even want to put a percentage on it but things changed very quickly saturday night and if one of the potential solutions is to reach out to michael worst case its certainly worth a phone call
7512466 i havent heard from anybody else so to say if i would or wouldnt is premature
7512467 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7512468 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7512469 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7512470 we have not journeyed all this way across the centuries

7512475 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7512476 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7512477 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7512478 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7512479 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7512480 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7512481 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7512482 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7512483 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7512484 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7512485 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
7512486 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
7512487 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

7512601 the recent yamuna floods are a set back and we think the water contamination may increase and add to the cholera situation besides it will be favourable for mosquito breeding
7512602 they need to be careful about their water intake to prevent spread of cholera and other gastroenterological problems the stagnant water would also assist in spread of dengue

7512732 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7512733 the simple message to the women who voted for hillary clinton is if you liked the last eight years under george w bush youre going to love the next four under john mccain
7512734 lets be honest its the most disastrous presidency weve had in modern american history and john mccain has said there are not a lot of significant issues that he disagrees with george w bush on
7512735 i suspect hillary clinton will be the good soldier and praise obama and rally her supporters to obama but the fact that he doesnt speak until the fourth night of the convention and that her supporters have significant roles on the first three nights could be risky
7512736 clinton and her supporters will be whooping it up on the convention floor for the first three nights while the obama backers look askance at them out of the corner of their eye waiting for him to take to the stage on the fourth and final night

7512758 in recent decades it has been possible to extract the gluten from wheaten bread so that people can eat bread without endangering their health despite the fact that gluten wheat poses a health threat which can often be serious the congregation of the doctrine of the faith stated in a reply in 1982 that the local ordinary could not permit a priest to consecrate special gluten free hosts for the communion of coeliacs
7512759 special hosts quibus glutinum ablatum est from which gluten has been removed are invalid matter for the celebration of the eucharist
7512760 given the centrality of the celebration of the eucharist in the life of the priest candidates for the priesthood who are affected by coeliac disease or suffer from alcoholism or similar conditions may not be admitted to holy orders
7512761 genetically engineered wheat will have an added protein which will make it tolerant to the herbicide of a biotech company
7512762 this raises questions whether it is lawful to use gm wheat as matter for the eucharist if notwithstanding a pressing health need the congregation of the doctrine of the faith refused to sanction gluten free hosts as valid matter for the eucharist because a protein has been extracted from the wheat how can it sanction genetically engineered wheat which has an added protein designed to make it resistant to a weed killer

7512775 mugabe has forged ahead with convening parliament and this is very unfortunate because as a party we had hoped something might come out of the interparty talks
7512776 clearly this is against the memorandum of understanding signed by the party leaders

7512783 the public should really recognize the science is really behind what we have said
7512784 i believe that bin laden has been able to get into the good graces of omar who is very poorly educated and unsure of foreign affairs and to influence him in his way of thinking
7512785 the potential ramifications of a mullah omar who is drifting toward pan islamism are grim first and foremost it could mean that the taliban would under no condition expel bin laden because they see his cause as theirs
7512786 time for a diplomatic solution may be running out taliban brush off of our indictment and other evidence may indicate movement from tolerance
7512787 si ellos los pa ses de la alianza se deciden a romper totalmente las relaciones no ocurrir nada terrible para rusia

7512789 pero quer amos relaciones plenas en pie de igualdad y no vivir de ilusiones cuando en torno nuestro se crean bases y la otan capta nuevos estados y a nosotros nos dicen no os preocup is no necesitamos esas ilusiones
7512790 est interesada en primer lugar la otan y no rusia
7512791 rusia no necesita m s a la otan de lo que ella nos necesita a nosotros la cooperaci n debe ser mutua
7512792 todo depende de las prioridades de la otan si la prioridad es el apoyo al r gimen de el presidente georgiano mija l saakashvili en perjuicio de la asociaci n con rusia eso no es culpa nuestra
7512793 cuando oyes que tanta gente ha visto el v deo y que el juez todav a no lo tiene sobre su mesa se produce un cierto enfado porque se considera que es un documento importante para la investigaci n y que tiene que estar en el juzgado

7512795 in humility there is mirrored the central mystery of the process of our transformation the mystery that our lord has put into these words unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die itself remaineth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit
7512796 god always gives a greater blessing to humble beginnings than to those that start with the chiming of bells
7512797 it constantly happens that the lord permits a soul to fall so that it may grow humbler when it is honest and realizes what it has done and returns it makes ever increasing progress in our lords service

7512802 not impossible for a deal to be done this year
7512803 how we dig out of this quagmire is the american story that obama must tell it is not a story of endless conflicts abroad but a potentially inspiring tale of serious economic educational energy and health care mobilization at home
7512804 and obama is constitutionally incapable of coming off angrier than mccain
7512805 a few more fisticuffs from the former law professor and many more from his running mate and other surrogates
7512806 can only help make him look less skinny metaphorically if not literally obama should go after mccains supposedly biggest asset experience much as mccain went after obamas crowd drawing celebrity

7512818 we are ready to take any decision up to halting relations altogether
7512819 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7512820 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7512821 in less than 100 years the georgian military has three times carried out genocide against the ossetian people why are they killing us because we simply want to live as equals with all the other nations
7512822 if it does this russia will further isolate itself from the entire world and will force the international community to seek more active ways to restore the territorial integrity of georgia

7512870 maybe that will remind us in some sense that actually our economy is a social economy as well as a commercial economy that in our city social entrepreneurship has always been and may always be as important as commercial entrepreneurship that our culture our sense of ourselves and our sense of whats happening in our city is determined as much by the social economy as it is by the commercial economy
7512871 a much needed and radical new departure in television in ireland
7512872 that more channels results in better television or more choice
7512873 the truth of course is that greater choice only comes when you have a greater diversity of programmes a wider range of views expressed from all sectors especially the minority and marginalised groups more inspiring ideas and stimulating and creative entertainment only then will we actually translate the number of channels into something that gives you genuine choice

7513163 are determined to consolidate world economy and in a 1973 memo on the trilateral policy program then director brzezinski recommended the study of control over mans development and behavior as a theme for later consideration more specifically such a task force would undertake to study the social educational implications of the availability especially in advanced societies of new means of social control trilaterialism is the current attempt by a ruling elite to manage both dependence and democracy at home and abroad
7513164 the debt leash can be pulled in tight as part of an economic and political destabilization campaign to strangle a rebellious nation into submission
7513165 invited to participate in shaping and administering the proposed new world order all those invited to join were members of the power elite in my view the trilaterial commission represents a skillful coordinated effort to seize control and consolidate the four centers of power political monetary intellectual and ecclesiastical
7513166 we cannot escape and indeed should welcome the task which history has imposed on us this is the task of helping to shape a new world order in all its dimensions spiritual economic political social
7513167 nowadays humanity so multifarious within its oneness needs a new philosophy of life a new ethic that can shape the fundamental values which are common to all religions and which rest upon the consensus of all the peoples of the earth

7513181 the more carbs and sugars you eat the more your appetite control cells are damaged and potentially you consume more
7513182 people in the age group of 25 to 50 are most at risk the neurons that tell people in the crucial age range not to over eat are being killed off
7513183 when the stomach is empty it triggers the ghrelin hormone that notifies the brain that we are hungry when we are full a set of neurons known as pomcs kick in
7513184 however free radicals created naturally in the body attack the pomc neurons this process causes the neurons to degenerate overtime affecting our judgement as to when our hunger is satisfied
7513185 a diet rich in carbohydrate and sugar that has become more and more prevalent in modern societies over the last 20 30 years has placed so much strain on our bodies that its leading to premature cell deterioration

7513232 it is a little bit disconcerting to see what feminism has evolved into
7513233 when theres a group of people attempting to shame female creativity female beauty female pride under the auspices of protecting women its really really scary
7513234 and i will put over them four divisions says the lord the sword causing death dogs pulling the dead bodies about and the birds of heaven and the beasts of the earth to take their bodies for food and put an end to them
7513235 i cannot see how key elements in the treaty could be given effect simply by legislation particularly as we have already held a referendum on the whole treaty
7513236 there will without a doubt be more cases after the closing of the olympic games
7513237 i do not think there is a system that we do not know
7513238 nowadays when there is something like this we always hear about it i do not believe in anything magical in any case if there were anything that has not been detected we will look for it and we will end up detecting it
7513239 we believe that we have had fewer cases because the deterrent effect has been augmented
7513240 it has become more difficult to cheat because a we have augmented the number of tests from 3 500 in athens to 4 500 now secondly we have also increased the penalties

7513264 weve increased prosecutions on the western slope over the past two years and will keep prosecuting criminal aliens here and in every part of colorado
7513265 significant sentences like this put essential teeth into u s immigration laws
7513266 aliens especially criminal aliens like renteria valdez cannot re enter the united states after being officially deported without suffering the severe consequences of their illegal actions
7513267 offer a wide range of undergraduate majors as well as masters and doctoral degrees
7513268 in order to better understand people i need to listen to them
7513269 if we can create easily accessible channels through which we can listen to nature we might get meaning and information that we wouldnt otherwise know
7513270 replaced people with machines so as to listen continuously and understand as much as possible but it turns out that a lot of citizen scientists including myself would rather be outdoors so the focus turned to how to better tell the story of nature through people
7513271 what can we tell about the environment from both the instruments and the people
7513272 the push now is toward facilitating international long distance collaboration for observing nature
7513273 for example in dealing with owls people elsewhere can listen to our backyards while we sleep and we can listen to their backyards while they sleep
7513274 im really exploring democratic venues through which large numbers of people can listen in
7513275 in a way that helps us obtain a broader understanding and appreciation of nature
7513276 protecting our children from individuals like this defendant who prey upon and sexually exploit children is a top priority for ice
7513277 sexual predators should know that ice will do everything in its power and use every tool at its disposal to keep our children safe whether the potential victims are around the block or around the world
7513278 the lengthy sentence imposed by the court removes a child predator from our community
7513279 the protection of children will continue to be a top priority for this office and the department of justice
7513280 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have every right to gain independence
7513281 and one of the main legal principles for recognizing independence is the fundamental principle of international law the right of people to self determination

7513283 when i say we i mean both south ossetia and abkhazia
7513284 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
7513285 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
7513286 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
7513287 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations
7513288 a large percentage of americans are not health literate which is related to significant health problems including medication errors failing to seek treatment and an inability to understand directions about proper health behavior
7513289 the role of a health journalist includes translating medical information and acting as a liaison responsible for providing quality information we need to actively find ways to improve health coverage and recognize the importance of the medias role in improving the publics quality of life
7513290 tacit understandings of health literacy interview and survey research with health journalists
7513291 we found that there are a variety of behaviors learning disabilities and emotional problems that are unique to patients with xxyy syndrome that may be better addressed with more targeted therapies
7513292 our research is important because it provides an accurate picture of what patients are experiencing that can help physicians who treat patients with the disorder
7513293 until now physicians have had to search the medical literature to patch together a treatment plan mostly based on information on klinefelter syndrome
7513294 as a result people with xxyy werent being screened for the specific medical problems associated with their disorder they werent receiving therapies or medications for the behavioral and neurodevelopmental issues that are more profound for them and they werent receiving the types of community services that can help them live independent lives our research is an important resource for families and practitioners
7513295 life skills are more of a struggle for these males and they may need different medications a broader array of behavioral therapies and more intensive community support than those with klinefelter syndrome
7513296 we were tired of having our families running around the country looking for answers from people who didnt have them
7513297 the more we talked the more we realized our boys had things in common that were not addressed in the literature
7513298 kyle knows that people dont understand xxyy and therefore dont understand him as a person she said
7513299 the study helps the world know why he is like he is
7513300 if you have a sample from a brother or a father it is easy but if we get away from this and have to turn to more distant relatives things are much much more complicated

7513341 the university of florida doesnt give scholarships unless youre absolutely amazing or youre an athlete
7513342 uwf was a logical choice given the competitive nature of other larger schools
7513343 we received about 600 more freshman applications this year over this time last year
7513344 continued growth for us is possible because the larger universities have gotten so big that they really dont have any room to grow and theyre running into caps set by the board of governors
7513345 i think we can still manage that within the constraints that are being imposed by the legislature and board of governors
7513346 although we have 15 new faculty coming in this year there are 37 faculty positions that used to exist that no longer exist

7513388 overall down the road its still a big priority for the government of canada
7513389 but for now we had to stop with that process because it bidding was definitely over and we have to provide the best value for taxpayers money
7513390 we realize the challenges that are coming and this is why i want to ensure that its still a top priority for our government and we will do everything that we can to speed up the processes
7513391 we heard a lot of noise on the ground since last friday
7513392 and i thought it was important to rectify some points
7513393 we advised first the bidders and the industry and then to be sure that the process was open and transparent we released the press release to make it clear for everybody
7513394 there has been a lot of speculation too around the canada buy policy and i just want to make sure that its clear that our government is committed to remain and keep working with that policy
7513395 if there were some visit in europe you know its the kind of thing that can happen to see how the things are done over there but it doesnt mean that we intend to breach that policy not at all

7513399 but this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry
7513400 theres a large relatively meaningful percentage of the population that walk around as carriers of listeria it exists in our environment in your environment
7513401 while these results are highly significant and indicate the investigation is on the right path the investigation is not complete
7513402 there will be a couple of days ill go without food
7513403 im used to it i mean ive been doing it for a couple of years now its just life i guess
7513404 i dont really tell too many people whats going on
7513405 i have one friend who knows the whole story and im comfortable with him knowing
7513406 i got it when i was younger and i was stupid to get it
7513407 its one of those things where you can spend money and not really spend money at the same time
7513408 friends ask me to go out and i just cant unless i say i have no money and that puts them in a bad situation because they either feel bad because theyre eating around me and im not or they end up paying for it and then i feel bad
7513409 theyre taking retail jobs kitchen jobs grocery stores or fast food
7513410 so theyre working but they cant get enough to get out of poverty
7513411 a lot of them would love to work more but its just not there for them
7513412 we have moderately good child tax benefits and support for low income families and we have the guaranteed income supplement for seniors but what happens to everyone in between
7513413 the problem is that crisis support isnt where its at
7513414 you have to do front end poverty reduction education supports all of that stuff for prevention and then on the other end you need longer term supports like more affordable housing
7513415 we know that the higher the level of education the less likely you are to be poor so were basically setting these kids up for failure if you had daycares in high schools youre preventing those drop outs
7513416 if i had a computer at home id probably be more inclined to do it because id have my own space
7513417 ever since i was five years old ive wanted to be a teacher
7513418 every kid will have a different story some of them dont feel welcome at school some have learning disabilities that are undiagnosed some of them have anger issues and some have addiction issues

7513421 when the olympics are held in britain and theres a football tournament where the final is going to be in britain they want us to have a team in the competition
7513422 at the moment in beijing we dont have a team no mens team and no womens team when it comes to london i think its important that there is a team so ive been talking to fifa the football association and sepp blatter and hes going to try and make it possible for us to have a team at the olympics then well talk to the other football associations and well see who wants to be part of this and maybe well get a manager that everybody is happy with i know sir alex ferguson has been approached by seb coe these are things that are possible alex ferguson has got to be formally approached of course
7513423 it was a dream game all i could think of was thank god the ball went over the line and now thanks to that i have a gold medal
7513424 when steve mcclaren was appointed he rang me and asked me to return he also came down to training and asked if i fancied it
7513425 that meant a lot to me but i dont think i was ever that close that i would have said yes
7513426 yes it wasnt about thinking it was too much or i wasnt capable it was just that when i was playing i was not enjoying it one little bit
7513427 i am 34 in november and hope to still be playing when i am 35
7513428 anything after that will be a bonus as long as i still feel i am contributing to united i will carry on
7513429 these new figures by erg are a strong indication that the review of the roaming regulation also has to tackle the issue of per second billing
7513430 to look at it in that amount of detail would prevent operators from having any flexibility
7513431 this shows there continues to be a worrying lack of competition in the roaming market

7513435 get the clickiness out of the files before the lesson starts
7513436 what we learn could lead to new interpretations of the forces of nature and possibly to an understanding of dark matter the mysterious substance that is believed to contribute the bulk of the mass of the universe
7513437 only about 1 in 10 billion collisions might produce a pair of z dibosons which we observed
7513438 the higgs is predicted to be at least 10 times rarer than the zz our observation of zz puts us deeper into higgs territory the observation of zz is perhaps the last experimental stepping stone before finding the higgs
7513439 could you imagine someone from the cavalier daily happening along and snapping a picture of me
7513440 all male all white coats and ties and nearly everyone born in the u s a
7513441 i love constructing the schedule its like a jigsaw puzzle
7513442 ill wonder about each city hell visit what would i like to do there its fun for this armchair traveler to learn about these places
7513443 also sometimes you have to bite your tongue you have to be aware of your constituency
7513444 at a staff retreat we took the myers briggs personality test and i scored off the scale for thriving on detail
7513445 i was upset because no one else was off the scale about anything but the trait does come in handy
7513446 we saw that as soon as we dont play together as soon as we dont put our spirit together we can lose we have to put more heart in keep focused and play our football
7513447 i believe they wanted it a bit more than us in the first half when you want to play at the top you must start the game with the right attitude and personality fulham started stronger and were sharper the corner showed that we were not sharp enough the mistake we made on the corner is not excusable
7513448 when you lose a game the solution is not always to buy
7513449 my passion for creating and sustaining healthy work environments in clinical and academic settings will be one of my guides as i enthusiastically look forward to working with the university community
7513450 changes in place with our beautifully appointed state of the art facility the claude moore nursing education building and the soon to be renovated mcleod hall and changes in top leadership with a dean transition
7513451 one real challenge of the job is that theres always more to show and say than we ever can but the great joy of this position is the sheer variety of its challenges
7513452 we typically plan about two years out although much of the work is concentrated in the seven or so months immediately before opening
7513453 an entire team is involved from exhibit curators designers and installers to library staff working in special collections or web development or digital services to faculty serving as advisers it can take nearly 20 people
7513454 id have to say that planning the exhibitions for the opening of the harrison institute small special collections in fall 2004 was the most challenging so far
7513455 it meant planning three simultaneous exhibitions from american journeys and its 300 highlights from special collections to declaring independence to flowerdew hundred
7513456 we had to come up with a custom high security display case to house the declaration of independence broadside and produce the documentary film that plays in the exhibition plus every exhibition has its own related brochures and publications
7513457 theres just something incredibly exciting about sharing the experience of original artifacts
7513458 again and again at these exhibits people have aha moments of realization of seeing the past from a fresh perspective
7513459 doctors nurses and other medical personnel face pressure to participate in abortion a practice that many find abhorrent in good conscience
7513460 the enforcement of federal laws designed to protect their freedom of conscience is long overdue
7513461 catholics do not stand alone in opposition to the deliberate destruction of nascent human life all health care providers should be free to serve their patients without violating their most deeply held moral and religious convictions on the value of life
7513462 organizations calling themselves pro choice are actually pro coercion in seeking to deny the freedom of doctors and nurses
7513463 dont doctors have the right to choose not to participate
7513464 over the coming 30 days of public comment the bishops urge the pro life american public to thank secretary leavitt and encourage hhs to implement the strongest possible regulations
7513465 people should not be forced to say or do things they believe are morally wrong
7513466 health care workers should not be forced to provide services that violate their own conscience
7513467 in any way change a patients right to a legal procedure
7513468 participating in any activity with a reasonable connection to the objectionable procedure including referrals training and other arrangements for offending procedures
7513469 poses a serious threat to womens health care by limiting the rights of patients to receive complete and accurate health information and services
7513470 an important reason for the crackdown is the olympics this year chinese leaders face more pressure from outside groups house churches and even ordinary individual citizens
7513471 has been marred by a well documented surge in violations of the rights of free expression and association as well as media freedom
7513472 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
7513473 it is important that this great country open itself to the gospel
7513474 the newly integrated rfid vol ser labels along with our feature rich custom developed software help make our dataguard rf system the easiest most accurate rfid tape tracking system on the market
7513475 with our open interface imation software that syncs with any existing tape management system data center managers can enjoy the benefits of rfid without changing their existing tms
7513476 a broad array of firms increasingly are aware that missing or lost tape cartridges not only can jeopardize their customers privacy and security but can also damage their public perception
7513477 imations dataguard rf provides a solution for more efficient tape cartridge tracking inventory and management that helps to mitigate exposure to these security related issues
7513478 it would have been unjust for us to have got anything out of it
7513479 durable cost effective rfid clear disc tag is one more example of daily rfids commitment to develop high value rfid products
7513480 daily rfids superior printing and encapsulation produce attractive durable tags and the passive rfid inlays give us long read range while keeping the investment low
7513481 after they realised we werent from home amp away there was this dead silence
7513482 the crickets were chirping and i think i could hear a crow in background so they ushered us up the red carpet and on to a podium to have our picture taken
7513483 then a security guard came up to me and the other female cast member and said can we get the girlfriends out of the shot we were like were actually in the show but thank you for validating our presence and our sense of equality in the comedy industry
7513484 i was like adams the nicest guy in the world of course hes going to say that then his producer called the following week theyve had me on five times this year
7513485 were nurturing new talent and getting good radio out of it abc tv is on board theyre basically looking for formats they can develop into television series the 10 episodes were making now are pilots but im delighted with it and id like it to continue
7513486 shows like little britain and the league of gentlemen started as radio shows and then went to tv
7513487 i thought the way i grew up was normal until i started comparing myself to other people
7513488 instead of giving us umbrellas for example mum would cut arm holes in a garbage bag we were only allowed to watch half an hour of tv a day until i reached the age of 10 i had to be in bed by 6pm when it was daylight savings the f ing sun would still be shining
7513489 if that was true my job would be done the jokes would write themselves id just sit back and put my hand out for the cash
7513490 were just trying to find out what we wanted to do with our lives
7513491 we just used to laugh about all these situations we and our friends would get into so we decided to do something with it
7513492 but the characters are not josh and i im not that much of a bitch
7513493 i think our friends just wondered what wed been doing for two years
7513494 estoy muy feliz los dos xitos me han hecho ilusi n y ojal pueda celebrar muchas m s cosas este a o
7513495 robben est incre ble es el primer partido que le veo y espero que siga as y mejore m s y m s cada d a porque es muy importante para el equipo
7513496 lo de robinho es un problema personal yo s lo deseo que se resuelva lo m s r pido y de la mejor forma posible para l y para el club
7513497 lo de julio fue lo mejor para las dos partes y si lo de robinho tambi n es as no hay problema aunque yo preferir a que se quedase
7513498 we heard significant interest in learning about innovative approaches other states were taking that could help improve their health system performance
7513499 go beyond narrowly targeted quality improvement projects to really engage in delivery system redesign
7513500 the sessions gave us an opportunity to step back and think through our initial plan for implementing medical homes and the steps needed they helped us refine our thinking about how we could move forward in a meaningful way
7513501 realized we need a model specifically designed to a rural state
7513502 we also encouraged the teams to examine their states existing public and private quality improvement projects and to coordinate efforts in order to align incentives and attain economies of scale
7513503 achieving person centered primary care the patient centered medical home
7513504 aligning quality measurement across payers and reforming payments to primary care physicians are essential to redesigning medical practices and implementing the medical home model
7513505 attaining a clearer understanding of what constitutes a medical home and its importance
7513506 were interested in models to effectively use resources to create medical homes that are more community based
7513507 if at the end of the year the states have taken concrete steps toward redesigning their health care systems and have established relationships and ongoing communication with each other well consider the institute a success and if they do these things we would also expect to see movement in their scorecard indicators in a few years
7513508 implementing a chronic care model for the people of massachusetts
7513509 the goal is to promote individualized guideline based care for each patient and for a practices population as a whole
7513510 the ultimate goal is to expand and integrate ehrs the patient registry and the exchange to support quality improvement throughout the public and private health systems in vermont
7513511 person centered care reforming services and bringing older citizens back to the heart of society

7513514 finding an experienced operator was the most crucial element of this joint bidding process and we believe sail and stade de france are an impressive team with an exciting vision for the stadium
7513515 they offer extensive experience and a successful track record in sport marketing stadium operations and events programmes this combination of international and local expertise is exactly what we were hoping for we are confident of concluding a comprehensive agreement with them
7513516 un oras insuportabil are potential sa fie un oras minunat
7513517 we understand that there is another child but we were unaware at the birth of the child that there was an issue so we did not have the opportunity to act
7513518 were very concerned that the health of both of these children is monitored and that the little baby in particular can be vaccinated
7513519 weve had some phone contact with them from time to time and obviously each time were urging them to come forward
7513520 the incidences of acute reactions to the hepatitis b vaccine are extremely rare and if they do occur they are usually short lived
7513521 so if youre weighing up the risks of vaccination versus not vaccination then we would certainly recommend vaccination
7513522 we will make a decision in the best interest of the family
7513523 like when he comes home after the office and opens the door hell find a note that would ask him to go to the window and open the curtains
7513524 and in it would be another note guiding him somewhere else where hell find a huge bday card tell me where should i keep the card please and finally the last note that would ask him to go to the bedroom where ill be waiting with lots of andles and delicious cake
7513525 which would be a usually just be a funny bit of propaganda but theyre actually paranoid enough to believe it

7513530 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
7513531 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7513532 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
7513533 for catechins the class of antioxidants under examination and among the most potent dietary antioxidants only between 0 1 and 1 1 per cent of the amount consumed makes it into our blood if we can improve that rate the benefits are enormous
7513534 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue
7513535 past research has shown that the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can positively impact the bodys immune defense and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract
7513536 steve jobs eventually will get old i like our chances
7513537 marbles was my favorite game and marbles were important to me
7513538 our initial assumption had been that things would stabilize as we got into the first part of next year
7513539 this big backup in mortgage rates puts that at significant risk
7513540 thats typical of any credit cycle when things get out of whack in one direction they overcompensate in the other
7513541 its simply not clear at least not clear to me what will stop this self reinforcing process
7513542 the primary focus to date has been on the provision of liquidity
7513543 the measures that affect capital either by supporting asset values injecting public funds or strengthening economic performance are increasingly important for the future
7513544 theyve already gone too far to the edge of the cliff
7513545 some form of intervention is going to be very difficult to avoid
7513546 there arent easy options from here but the one that supports the mortgage market is going to override
7513547 the crisis has now spread to the real economy and who knows what will happen as a result
7513548 give a person fireworks and you make them happy for a day teach a person how to make fireworks and you make them happy for a lifetime

7513558 voters are divided over whether mccain would continue bushs policies thats one reason why mccain is competitive imagine what this election would look like if george w bush were running for re election or vice president dick cheney were running to succeed him
7513559 the republican party and mccain are being by helped by the recent crisis between the republic of georgia and russia anything that heightens concern over national security is likely to be good for mccain

7513561 mrs elliott i wanted to come by and thank you personally for this book not to get to personal but our marriage was going down hill we have been married almost 25 years and we didnt have a sex life anymore i purchased this book from you and took it home left it in the bathroom for my husband to read
7513562 mrs elliott i want to let you know that you have saved our marriage we wanted to personally thank you together
7513563 a certification of birth also known as a short form birth certificate the long form is drawn up by the hospital and includes additional information such as birth weight and parents hometowns
7513564 the hawaii department of healths birth record request form does not give the option to request a photocopy of your long form birth certificate but their short form has enough information to be acceptable to the state department we tried to ask the hawaii doh why they only offer the short form among other questions but they have not given a response
7513565 recently factcheck representatives got a chance to spend some time with the birth certificate and we can attest to the fact that it is real and three dimensional and resides at the obama headquarters in chicago
7513566 we couldnt get someone on the phone in hawaii to tell us whether the number represented some secret information and we erred on the side of blacking it out since then weve found out its pretty irrelevant for the outside world
7513567 potentially if you have that number you could break into the system
7513568 they responded and apparently it isnt good enough that he posted his birth certificate
7513569 they say they want it because they claim he is not a citizen of the united states its pretty ridiculous
7513570 to presume kennedy is coming and make preparations on the basis of him coming
7513571 youre odd i would have thought that you above all others would try to gain my favor you are new after all
7513572 forgive me if i dont fawn over your fathers pocket book like everyone else dose my father will disapprove of me saying this but if you ever want me to like you youll have to work for it or maybe thats too much for you i bet youve never actually gained another persons respect
7513573 make me brat or does the spoiled prince not want to get his precious hands dirty
7513574 i am ashamed of you two mostly you nicolai what would you father say if he found out that you were fighting
7513575 get up and take your places ill decide on your punishment after class
7513576 the punishment for your earlier action is one hundred lines i will refrain from fighting because it is a barbaric activity and could scar my families reputation i am being lenient on you since this is your first offence however do not think that i will not tell your fathers in fact i will go and do just that get started if you finish your lines before i return place them on my desk when you are finished you may leave
7513577 you provoked me and stop calling me a spoiled prince
7513578 you are a fool i bet im the first person to ever point out the truth to you in fact im also willing to wager that youre an only child
7513579 this is the last time i try to befriend someone like you
7513580 if you really want to know then yes i was testing your reactions to see what kind of a person you are and i didnt like what i saw
7513581 you are a very confusing person if you wanted to be my friend you should have asked me to sit with you not insult me
7513582 ah but then you would have thought that i was like those other boys and im not if you hadnt noticed i have never once lied to you now if youll pardon me im going to hurry and get this done
7513583 hey new kid you have some nerve getting into a fight with nicolai
7513584 at least i wasnt sucking up to him like you three were

7513615 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7513616 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it
7513617 theres a lot of very creative people in the group
7513618 they make so many different crafty visually brilliant things and they love using their talents to push this along and see their costume on the news

7513632 john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7513633 up to 7 7 times more energy than what is used in making the ethanol
7513634 you know most people just dont understand that biomass isnt very energy dense
7513635 it always amuses me to see these motorsport magazine evaluations of drivers
7513636 for me you have to take into consideration how long a driver has been in formula one when you evaluate his performance
7513637 for no other reason that puts lewis top of the heap he is the best in formula one at the moment
7513638 if you take into account how little experience he has had thats the bit that gives him the edge
7513639 it doesnt mean to say he is particularly quicker than the others or he has dominated its just you have to take how long they have been involved in the sport as one of the values
7513640 how can you criticise him only a fool doesnt realise that irrespective of age you learn something every day
7513641 it is no different for a racing driver because they spend their whole life driving a racing car and they are going to learn more and more
7513642 with all drivers in formula one they are on a very steep learning curve and the longer they are in it the steeper it becomes
7513643 i wouldnt be surprised if lewis has won more races to grands prix at his age i doubt there has ever been a driver who has won eight of his first 29 races
7513644 i still look back on lewis behaviour after losing the world title
7513645 he took it a hell of a lot better than i did and more than many other people in the company
7513646 i dont think he used his inexperience as a crutch at all so on the sunday evening after brazil my admiration for him went up a significant amount
7513647 its at least order of magnitude more important to worry about the demand side rather than the supply side
7513648 u s has single handedly corrected a chronic global supply demand imbalance helping to drop crude prices nearly 25 over the past 2 months
7513649 the department of energy says the projected price impact of opening up additional outer continental shelf drilling in the us is
7513650 will the gops cynical lies destroy the chance for serious energy and climate policy
7513651 it was dense enough that you couldnt see more than five yards in that area a person could have been five yards away and not seen anything
7513652 the bottom line is it is just not necessary to use facebook when you have all these other venues
7513653 on a professional level i dont want to know about their personal lives
7513654 i absolutely cant vouch for the truth of this story
7513655 some of these pragmatic issues may have been tackled already by the various private companies including oil industry giants chevron and shell which are already researching algae fuel but a published scientific report on these fundamentals will be a major benefit to other researchers looking into algae biofuel
7513656 its just a matter of dealing with problems and doing whatever we have to do
7513657 we certainly feel the imperative need to get our systems running
7513658 if it got below zero degrees tonight wed still be able to heat that entire building
7513659 there was a situation but we dont believe there is one anymore
7513660 young people have always been essential to the campaign and will continue to be
7513661 thats why we work hard to let them know we need them to be involved when they get back to school again
7513662 students have already showed an interest in the campaigns and will definitely continue to up until election night
7513663 for students without cell phones its important for them to know where they can go to get help
7513664 some personal responsibility falls on students to be sure theyre walking in groups and taking safety measures on their own for their own well being
7513665 nite ride is a ride home so if youre home we wont pick you up and take you somewhere
7513666 but if youre in the library for example well take you back home
7513667 its tough sometimes but i think theyre doing the best they can
7513668 really small businesses fall through the net so there arent any options if they need funds to recover they need additional loans
7513669 we want the businesses back and this was one small way we could indicate our support for these businesses
7513670 we just thought that at this time 25 000 would be adequate and if they needed more we could contribute more later leaving the door open for more donations if need be
7513671 cash is limited so we want to balance our budget and maintain our operations without getting into a bind financially
7513672 when you have these kinds of dollar impacts you have to step it up and find ways to help people and that potentially means other budgets must be affected
7513673 in the long run we know small businesses provide more jobs than large businesses
7513674 theyre really the driver to the american economy so it seems really shortsighted not to help small business come back from a disaster
7513675 some of our students struggle because of existing barriers but we have programs in place to take out those barriers
7513676 the label attached to the school doesnt equate to its quality
7513677 i thought what a great idea weve been planning this for a year now
7513678 its set up its organized really well and all the volunteers are really helpful
7513679 this is the first thing ive been to and its been pretty good
7513680 i suspect thats kind of where obama went with the biden pick
7513681 i dont think it hurts i do think it helps some
7513682 its not a bad pick its just not an amazing pick
7513683 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7513684 im not sure hes one of those people you can just say you need to be quiet joe
7513685 its hard to tell recently biden has been pretty careful about things
7513686 as long as he continues that way it will be ok
7513687 in terms of how the ui talks to freshmen specifically they are much more concerned about whether they are fit for the university and are they going to be successful
7513688 people dont pay attention to whether you are ranked 22nd or 23rd
7513689 looking at all of the factors that the u s news looks at weve pretty much stayed the same
7513690 its more of a matter of other universities moving ahead of us
7513691 the only thing thats a little upsetting is that you cant say youre in one of the top 20 business schools
7513692 many peer universities especially in the big ten are much more selective than the ui is
7513693 iowa came together during and right after the flood but the sense of a community working together is fading and people could be starting to feel alone
7513694 people are now realizing all that was lost and all that is to be done thats what were here for
7513695 we talked to some of the families that came and they told us their personal horror stories
7513696 sometimes people just need an unbiased interested person to listen
7513697 it will be hard for those whose home community was affected by flooding to come here and see their university disrupted as well
7513698 everyone has done a tremendous job preparing to make this semester as normal as possible
7513699 students have to cope with that hassle factor for a while but the flood showed the strength of iowans and now everyone has to find the best way to move on
7513700 because of band camp we have to go all the way to west high
7513701 im sure the flood will affect her somehow but its her first year so she wont notice
7513702 i got all my stuff in really early so i was supposed to live in mayflower but my friends and i didnt know if it would be open so we switched
7513703 i was supposed to be in temp housing so i was just happy to get a dorm
7513704 i had heard that the campus was going to start late so i was worried about that
7513705 i liked the campus when i came for a college visit
7513706 as a homeowner i have to want to be bought out
7513707 look at this place youd be crazy to want to leave
7513708 ive got nothing to hide so electronic surveillance doesnt bother me to the contrary im delighted that the bush administration is monitoring calls and electronic traffic on a massive scale because catching terrorists is far more important that worrying about the governments listening to my phone calls or reading my emails
7513709 might permit an innocent american to be subjected to such intrusive surveillance based in part on race ethnicity national origin religion or on protected first amendment activities
7513710 if you visited a home in india this is what you would be eating
7513711 theres just nothing like home cooking especially when its delicious ethnic food
7513712 this whole thing provides such an important opportunity to iowans to learn about this culture
7513713 nous sommes tout pr s darriver la conclusion du travail commenc la saison derni re mais nous savons que nous allons devoir jouer avec la m me d termination quau match aller turin
7513714 nous allons tre face une quipe qui voudra faire un grand match devant son public cela ne sera pas facile pour nous
7513715 theyve got some great tools are good hard working kids theyre big guys who can move
7513716 were very fortunate as a defense to have big skilled guys that can move like that
7513717 i cant put all the pressure on mitch and matt
7513718 we just need to keep that intensity up and just know that theyre there to help us if we have any questions on the field
7513719 anytime you start right in the middle of the defense and youve got two guys who have played three and four years who are good players good guys who are hard workers who are leaders it means a hell of a lot
7513720 i dont pretend to know all of the guys in the country but ill just as soon have our two as opposed to any other two in the country
7513721 i conquered the 48 ouncer at geezer bills steak amp grill
7513722 im not interested in an easy decision i just hope we can make a good decision im going to take my time
7513723 well give them a shot at it and when the time comes and it looks to me like somebody is ready to go head to head well sit down talk it out and go from there
7513724 i really dont have a take on it the coaches are going to make the best decision they can make
7513725 were going to try to come back here four times a year
7513726 innovation and compromise are needed for epa hog farms and iowans
7513727 unable to distinguish between our friends and our enemies he has essentially adopted our enemies view of the world
7513728 i was just so pumped to go out and play
7513729 the women got us really pumped for the game and to play someone other than ourselves
7513730 our whole team is just amazing we all work together and communicate great
7513731 it feels like weve been making very sincere connections with people
7513732 like a kids book but in an adult way a fairy tale all put together with wood and shambles
7513733 its a huge part of what i strive for in life to remain childish in some ways
7513734 theres so much music out there that doesnt really mean anything its just there for the wrong reasons we want to create something that can help make peoples lives better i think the innocence and sincerity has a lot to do with that
7513735 damn id like to earn the shit outta that a all night
7513736 is just an arbitrary ideal placed upon you by a society that doesnt understand how ambition makes you feel
7513737 thats right they dont understand my need to become the best psychiatrist since carl jung
7513738 this takes a step forward in two ways firstly the use of bone as well as skin and next is carrying out this operation on someone with a benign tumour
7513739 there will always be limitations to this the main one would be a societal constraint a lack of suitable donors
7513740 however there is certainly demand for this with the major area being for people with facial burns
7513741 this particular surgery is a way of giving back a life to a patient who has been horribly scarred by burns trauma or a tumour
7513742 the cost of health care continues to be a real and pressing concern
7513743 making sure we are paying for high quality health care services not just the number of services provided is just one of the most critical issues facing the american public and the federal government now and in the future
7513744 the two of us had plans for what we were going to do but you could say our whole lives stopped
7513745 and believe me when you see someone dying of aids its really bad its different each time no one dies the same way
7513746 this aids study was it seems the beginning of many years of research being carried out on me without my knowledge or consent
7513747 if as the ethics application form states consent was obtained from all subjects how is it that i did not know about my aids status until 1987
7513748 i did not know anything about his studies or research
7513749 i believe nonconsensual research was conducted by doctors of hemophilia in this country
7513750 frustration a sense of being repeatedly betrayed there are lessons to be learned that havent been learned yet
7513751 i dont know why its there but i think its a blessing
7513752 it raises the hair on your neck it gives you chills
7513753 change we need after eight years of failed policies that favored special interests at the expense of our families under george bush and john mccain
7513754 joe biden is the genuine article who has brought change to washington without being changed by washington
7513755 theres only three things he mentions in a sentence a noun and a verb and 9 11 i mean theres nothing else
7513756 stronzo come cazzo guidi c la bambina davanti mavvess potutt accider a piccirell

7513758 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7513759 we dont have any illusions about the challenges we face in getting our message out but you cant expect people to cover you if you dont show up
7513760 there should be a balance and we want to make sure were available to tell the other side of the story
7513761 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7513762 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7513763 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law
7513764 they need to stop standing in the way of expanding domestic production and take meaningful steps now to address the pain caused by high energy prices
7513765 when congress returns they should remove this restriction so we can get these vast oil resources from the ocean floor to your gas tank
7513766 this congress has been one of the most unproductive on record theyve failed to address the challenge of high gas prices
7513767 they need to send me a bill next month that i can sign so we can bring relief to drivers small business owners farmers and ranchers and every american affected by high prices at the pump
7513768 youve got to hand it to the candidate and the campaign they have a great sense of timing and tone and appropriateness six months ago people said he wasnt tough enough on hillary clinton he was being too passive but he got it right at the right time
7513769 the world of wine is really based on a french vocabulary the names of the grapes are french son and words like clos and chateau are all over wine you cant really appreciate wine if you dont understand its traditional language
7513770 i dont need to read french to know if its red or white

7513774 fruit of the long and hard work of the plo and its representatives abroad
7513775 reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
7513776 neither this man nor his parents sinned but this happened so that the work of god might be displayed in his life
7513777 neither this man nor his parents sinned let the glory of god be displayed
7513778 but in the middle of this mess i have come to put the glory of god on display
7513779 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
7513780 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
7513781 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
7513782 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
7513783 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
7513784 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
7513785 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
7513786 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
7513787 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
7513788 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself

7513790 in our view they need a persons consent if they make use of a persons face for commercial ends
7513791 in america people have been photographed in potentially tricky positions one man appeared to be climbing a fence while two men in san francisco appeared to be gazing at a woman as she bent over an ambulance driver was seen stopping and eating a sandwich
7513792 we will not launch in uk until we are comfortable street view complies with local law including law relating to the display of images of individuals we will use technology like face blurring and operational controls such as image removal tools so street view remains useful and in keeping with local norms wherever it is available
7513793 due to a huge demand for the iphone 3g we are currently out of stock online come back on 10 july sic for more information
7513794 there is nothing wrong with change if it is in the right direction
7513795 weve looked back over the last two or three runs and noticed that a whole programme can get swallowed up by one monster film a bit like one of those yes albums from the 70s where side one is just one track so were trying to calm down the prog rock side actually a band analogy is a good one here i was reading the other day how rem had spent ages recording previous albums and tied themselves in knots in the process but that their latest one was knocked out fast with short sharp songs that dont outstay their welcome well inevitably still have big films cos its the only way you can enjoy the three of them cocking about together but theyll be shorter overall and alongside them well be inserting some quick two or three minute punk songs
7513796 the plurk service has an odd quirky feel to it its much more visual than twitter and its fun to use
7513797 it takes much longer to listen to a message than read it and voicemail is usually outside of our typical workflow making it hard to forward or reply to easily
7513798 im more likely to respond to your urgent message if you text me or email me or just call me back in half an hour
7513799 in todays busy busy world of instant communications voicemail seems quaint there is no way of knowing if or when a message will be received and the industry estimates that 20 per cent of the billions of voicemails left each year simply sit there unloved and unheard
7513800 more mobile carriers are offering text conversion for a monthly or per message fee its my guess this will become more and more common voice is here to stay as a data input method but listening to messages will certainly become an increasing luxury to be reserved for loved ones or those messages that arent transcribed properly or you need to hear it for tone or emotion for now most people dont have voicemail transcription services so think before you voicemail more and more people just find it annoying
7513801 some vandalistic tosser gets his christian name in the paper for wrecking a waxcrafters hard work on a drunken dare and the german establishment applauds him

7513809 auctions in some categories are already pretty much dead not many people bid for rechargeable batteries gillette razor blades toothbrushes or even mobile phone handsets or dvds the kind of commodity items you pick up in a supermarket ebay started out for the collectors market but its been overtaken by the business market buyers have become used to instant sales on the internet and they expect ebay to be no different
7513810 none of the promotional imagery is anything other than computer generated albeit from geniune data sources people like to believe that satellite images are standard photographs when the truth is a lot of standard imagery is false colour although the images provided to promote the series are intriguing they are really just graphical representations of data on top of an altered satellite image ive nothing against this type of representation per se but i do think that data is more readily accepted when it looks pretty these images and maps offer brightly coloured lines and dots and the appearance of a fast moving exciting world often the images look great and you think wow look how interesting that is without really thinking about whether it shows anything at all
7513811 a daily dose of satirical news comment and all round silliness
7513812 the dark knight may be based on a comic book but its a real movie made by real talents exciting engaging gorgeously crafted and thematically rich nolans set himself up for a third film of course and even with ledgers passing removing the possibility of his returning to the series there are still plenty of places nolan might take batman the confidence vision and skill hes brought to the dark knight make that something to be hoped for
7513813 while someone someday might make a better superhero movie the bar has been set very very high the dark knight isnt just the best movie of the summer its the best movie of the year so far and everything else is going to have to try very very hard to top it
7513814 and on camera there you see aragon s the spain coach who in 1977 took a holiday to a lovely little cottage in brighton and also went to see emlyn hughes pick up his 50th cap for his country when they beat italy 2 0 at wembley

7513849 its hard to believe that john mccain is now in danger of exceeding his credit limit on the equivalent of an american express black card his campaign is cheapening his greatest strength and making a mockery of his already dubious claim that hes reticent to talk about his p o w experience by flashing the p o w card to rebut any criticism no matter how unrelated the captivity is already amply displayed in posters and tv advertisements
7513850 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about its a pretty hard experience hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7513851 i spent some years without a kitchen table without a chair and i know what it is like to be blessed with the opportunities of this great nation
7513852 listen pal i spent 22 years in the navy my grandfather was in the navy we in the military service tend to move a lot we have to live in all parts of the country all parts of the world i wish i could have had the luxury like you of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the first district of arizona but i was doing other things as a matter of fact when i think about it now the place i lived longest in my life was hanoi

7513949 that was important to us we scored two good goals on set pieces the pieces were set up because we were able to get behind the defense which is something we really tried to concentrate on last week getting behind the defense caused them to foul us the fouls set up the set pieces
7513950 for a while i was saying that our team was really figuring out how to play on the road but after these last two road games it is hard to feel that just because of the number of chances were giving away
7513951 its not even the number of goals were allowing though the game tonight probably could have been six or seven it seems like weve got to take a few steps back here and figure things out quickly defensively
7513952 we definitely had the better run of play early on but to get a result on the road in a hostile place like this is big
7513953 obviously when you give up a goal in extended time you feel like something got away
7513954 but its also nice that we got a point on the road and we played 30 plus minutes with a man down it was also a pretty physical game im glad to get a point
7513955 its really hard to break down 10 guys when theyre all committed to doing the same thing

7513957 i dont really like making excuses but when every week we change four or five guys in the lineup its difficult
7513958 but the commitment from the players is magnificent i think they all work hard and theyre committed san jose maybe has one good look at the end and zach makes a good save but we had 10 i dont know if thats not good playing but we had 10 good looks

7514059 i think the glory of it is that as evidenced by the reaction the power balance has shifted enough

7514061 and heres the thing too when people see the movie from end to end the last thing they ever comment on when its over is me my role the movie has so many other things in it that are way more crazy and creepy than the idea of an australian playing an african american it literally does not even make the top ten thats how nuts this movie is

7514230 thank you dark knight thats added close to half a billion dollars
7514231 one film like the dark knight can make a huge difference
7514232 si dovrebbe assimilare i colori della vita ma non ricordarne i particolari
7514233 il faudra du temps pour que cela se mette en place mais notre conviction cest que les familles les lus et les enseignants vont se rendre compte que les l ves qui ont particip ce dispositif ont un atout une situation meilleure la rentr e donc je pense que l mulation jouera
7514234 des parents poseront leurs lus la question de savoir pourquoi dans leur ville il ny a pas de soutien scolaire
7514235 unaccountable and divorced from presidential control to a degree not previously countenanced in our constitutional structure
7514236 si dovrebbe assimilare i colori della vita ma non ricordarne i particolari
7514237 mingle with clients charm partners and shine in social functions
7514238 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7514239 we feel confident that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7514240 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7514241 i am here because of the opportunities that my father had that my mother had you know we are who americans were supposed to be
7514242 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7514243 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7514244 i am not going to talk about the politics of it
7514245 ill just say that sen biden is a very fine statesman i have known him for a long time he has been a really very supportive committee chair and before that ranking member for the state department and our diplomatic efforts
7514246 be good to nature and itll be good to you
7514247 from our point of view it was fantastic right from the start
7514248 some members were initially very reluctant to use it but now they dont know how we did without it
7514249 we had problems with insurance and having people covered as soon as they did something because there was a one week turnaround
7514250 they had to send in paper work and we had to process a cheque whereas now a payment is made online instantly
7514251 when we review our registrations we are able to generate the subscriptions by member type divers coaches officials or volunteers and they all get an email to say it is due and they pay it online
7514252 so in a matter of five minutes all the registrations for the year can be done without the paperwork and mailouts
7514253 we found it was going to cost in the vicinity of 30 000 with some of the other quotes we got and being a tiny organisation it was just not possible
7514254 what really won us over was that their banking systems are fully integrated and reconciled every month by them
7514255 a lot of the other ones went through the paypal system which is just so much more complicated from our point of view
7514256 when you have government grants they like to know if a dive school project as we are running at the moment could result in someone ending up in the olympics in eight years
7514257 we have a 10 year old girl in our talent identification program and we can track what programs she has gone through by what she has entered over that time we couldnt do anything like that before
7514258 the main thing is to get our newsletter into a more electronic format
7514259 im delighted to welcome such a diverse group of member companies
7514260 the expansive nature of our membership continues to reflect the transformation of our industry and the broadening of abms footprint
7514261 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7514262 its reasonable to discuss already today the transdniestr problem i see good chances for solving it
7514263 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7514264 this is a serious warning for us all it is in this context that we should view the question of transdniestr resolution
7514265 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7514266 this is our largest microwave contract to date in latin america it shows that mini link tn is the best in class microwave platform from both a commercial and technical point of view it provides telcel with all pdh sdh and ip capacity requirements for a true high speed mobile broadband network
7514267 heres a list of 79 random everyday tasks but mats sundin is somehow not a normal person and has never done any of these things because he is a professional hockey player until now maybe
7514268 it is written on the bottom of it mark brandon chopper read never plead guilty it was a gift to a friend
7514269 i was extremely cooperative and pleasant at all times during the arrest
7514270 the allegation is that he went around to a property there was an argument i understand there were alleged threats
7514271 if it had occurred they would have plucked him straight away
7514272 same store sales are down 8 through the first 2 1 2 weeks of august the particularly poor economic climate in california florida and the desert southwest continues to adversely affect nearly 25 of our stores and we do not expect conditions in these regions to improve in the near term we expect that same store sales will decline in the high single digits
7514273 during the quarter we continued to move forward with our strategy to grow our apparel business enhance productivity of our real estate portfolio and reduce or exit unprofitable product classifications
7514274 our apparel business showed a solid 13 same store sales increase during the quarter and now represents 81 of our total sales we expect to end the year with apparel representing 85 of our sales mix we believe that by concentrating on apparel and reducing our emphasis on lower margin footwear and accessories we can improve our merchandise margins over time junior apparel achieved same store sales growth of 26 duing the quarter and now represents 51 of our apparel sales we believe there is an additional opportunity to grow the junior business and have set our next target milestone to be 55 of our apparel sales at this level we would still be below many of our peer group whose junior mix is typically greater than 60 of sales
7514275 i remain confident in our belief that we are taking the appropriate actions to improve the areas of the business where we have direct control 2008 remains very challenging but we believe that we are doing the right things to position our company for success when the environment improves in the meantime we will continue to manage expenses and capital needs prudently for the remainder of the year
7514276 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7514277 its reasonable to discuss already today the transdniestr problem i see good chances for solving it
7514278 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7514279 this is a serious warning for us all it is in this context that we should view the question of transdniestr resolution
7514280 right after the conflict with georgia russia would look very indecent if it immediately annexed south ossetia and abkhazia
7514281 i was waiting around all morning and then suddenly there he was
7514282 i thought the little fellow would fly off right away but no he decided to stay for a meal
7514283 he is quite dapper and has such a lovely color
7514284 i dont know how he does it without stopping to take a nap my goodness
7514285 that food is for the hummingbirds not the bees and the ants
7514286 buenas bueno solo era pa saludar hoy me siento muy animada y he aprovechado pa empezar un peke o ayuno de aki al jueves a ver si soy capaz de conseguirlo y sobre todo de perder 3 kilillos en ese tiempo 5 diitas uff ta un pokillo de complicaillo pero se intentara hoy solo e comido una zanahoria en to el dia y me siento genial con muchas fuerzas y super contenta un besazo a todas os kiero un monton
7514287 cest un beau succ s une tape est franchie dans la
7514288 il ny a pas de minorit francophone en flandre il y a des immigrants qui doivent sadapter
7514289 quand la gauche ne repr sente pas une alternative cest la droite qui gagne
7514290 i said then 35 000 people drank the kool aid he said barack is a clean cut guy he never liked gutter politics thats why the clintons did so and so i said i dont want to get into this so i went over to the elevator and he said uncle tom then he grabbed me and hugged me and started laughing i said what did you say i turned to freddrenna lyle and i said what did he say she wouldnt say anything thats when i said some bad things to him
7514291 calling me an uncle tom is beyond the pale especially considering where he is close with mayor daley and with gov blagojevich i am hardly the uncle tom here
7514292 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter
7514293 a drunk woman is not a master of her pussy
7514294 unfortunately in a typical bean counter response to a threat to the profit model this comes down to protecting an expensive investment and in a free market economy the investment many times wins over blatant slap you in the face logic
7514295 a drunk woman is not a master of her pussy
7514296 it is unethical and impermissible to change the rules in the middle of an election to benefit the mayor and the council who are the ones drafting and enacting the legislation to overturn the votes twice of the people
7514297 ive said publicly before the council should have three terms
7514298 but i think any change in term limits should go before the voters again
7514299 anthony has favored ending term limits but believes the right way to do it is by public vote
7514300 new yorkers voted it in and they deserve the right to vote it out if they so choose
7514301 it was blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his 15 minutes of fame
7514302 my family is wonderful so very happy were all great
7514303 we love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
7514304 we all need to do our part and make changes for the better
7514305 there can be some smugness on the part of the prius owners because its distinctive
7514306 if someone wants a prius they better put the order in
7514307 unless toyota sends a lot more cars were going to see prius wait lists spin out again to about six months
7514308 i think that we prius owners need a dating whatever program to hook us up with other prius owners
7514309 stems from my inability to look at people with gas burning cars as attractive
7514310 a big component of hybrid ownership is the social aspect
7514311 i do believe in global warming but the prius isnt the answer
7514312 every time i look at a prius it only reaffirms my belief that ultra liberals and poorly educated science environments are the worlds greatest threats go hug a tree prius buyers
7514313 there is a lot of interest in naturally grown food
7514314 but people do not seem to understand why it costs more
7514315 if this was a way for providing funding for all the necessary services i would support it
7514316 i recognize the need for the development of a national policy this might be a starting point
7514317 it links together the four pillars of sustainability the environment social needs cultural needs and the ability to sustain a thriving economy
7514318 an event like this is important in and of itself i think sustainability is also about bringing the community together for me sustainable planning is community development work you have to bring people in get a positive attitude and get people out and involved its about changing the way we do things and we dont want to impose change we want people to be inspired and come along with us
7514319 our commercial corporate and business communities are leaders they have recognized that their success on all levels depends on how they deal with these sustainability issues
7514320 the use of chemicals poisoning our water and groundwater systems is no longer acceptable
7514321 i think the dichotomy of environment versus economy is old and is becoming quickly outdated
7514322 there is the perception out there because of the bad news stories that we are not open for business and that is not accurate
7514323 we have multiple industrial sites within industrial parks we have land we have a workforce we have good access to education and we have access to the port of saint john
7514324 this is a long term process we have to retool our workforce with the drop in fishing and forestry
7514325 and there is a lot of effort in actively looking for a model to follow to improve our area
7514326 what we are doing at this juncture is talking to big box stores
7514327 instead of dropping containers in halifax or moncton and distributing them from there it may be more feasible to drop containers in saint john use the ferry and distribute product from here we have the warehouse space now that could be used
7514328 that will require fabrication and those kinds of things and we have a number of companies on this side that could benefit
7514329 from the saint john board of trade view one of the things we want to do is work more with chambers in our region and that includes the digby board of trade
7514330 to come to saint john and meet our directors and talk about the opportunities and show them first hand what is going on in our region
7514331 so that may be an opportunity for the folks in the digby annapolis valley area there may be people with skills there that could benefit from what is going on in saint john
7514332 we tell business we are open for business and it is as much a pr exercise as it is a co ordination exercise
7514333 its not flashy its long slow painful plodding work and its kind of sad if people think there is an instant fix
7514334 when they first closed the base and acoa was running it it didnt work
7514335 the local community took over and it became very successful there is a lot of industry there
7514336 i have an idea run around in water get wet
7514337 be as radical a social reformer as mrs thatcher was an economic reformer
7514338 made the conservatives into a tireless defender of the overdog
7514339 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego
7514340 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill

7514344 you pet me you feed me you shelter me you love me you must be god
7514345 you pet me you feed me you shelter me you love me
7514346 for from him and through him and to him are all things to him be glory forever amen
7514347 through him we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among the nations
7514348 addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making melody to the lord with all your heart giving thanks always and for everything to god the father in the name of our lord jesus christ
7514349 wives submit to your own husbands as to the lord husbands love your wives as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
7514350 slaves obey in everything those who are you earthly masters not by way of eye service as people pleasers but with sincerity of heart fearing the lord whatever you do work heartily as for the lord and not for men knowing that form the lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward you are serving the lord christ
7514351 servants be subject to your masters with all respect not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust for this is a gracious thing when mindful of god one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly
7514352 in the same way let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your father who is in heaven
7514353 by this my father is glorified that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples
7514354 i appeal to you therefore brothers by the mercies of god to present your bodies as
7514355 do not present your members to sin but present yourselves to god as those who have been brought from death to life and your members to god as instruments for righteousness
7514356 you are not your own for you were bought with a price so glorify god in your body
7514357 may the god of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another in accord with christ jesus that together you may with one voice
7514358 our earlier initiatives have delivered encouraging results to date and we see further potential for international sales to grow as a percent of overall revenues over the longer term
7514359 our intention has been to enter additional countries on a step wise basis to further capitalize on the interest from clinicians in our breast care products that we see in a number of markets around the world with the addition of these five new geographic markets senorx will now have a presence in over 20 countries
7514360 the simulation based optimization methodology has not changed for over 25 years and is far too time consuming to use for large scale analog circuit designs
7514361 titan analog migration allows designers to capture design know how in a structured and repeatable format and optimize circuits to given specifications using mathematical optimization techniques it allows customers to very quickly explore the specification boundaries of their own circuits and optimize analog circuits for lower power and lower area in a fraction of the time
7514362 with the introduction of this new series of products pgt provides a one stop shop for the commercial construction sector and a more complete architectural systems offering
7514363 we are committed to making it easy for our customers to do business with pgt by offering a new pre assembled system that reduces installation time and makes integration of these products in a project cost effective
7514364 our business demands the efficient porting of custom circuits to meet the needs of our customers
7514365 the titan analog migration solution offers impressive productivity benefits and accelerates porting of designs across multiple leading edge manufacturing processes
7514366 analog migration presents a fundamental challenge and magma has developed the technology to effectively address this problem
7514367 the titan analog migration solution provides rambus with design exploration capabilities for their complex high performance mixed signal designs
7514368 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
7514369 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7514370 one of contemporary arts more exciting areas of endeavor and certainly its most dramatically improved one
7514371 the issue of reducing emissions from deforestation in market mechanism has been a stormy one among delegates and observers
7514372 there is a point where it will be too late it is better we speed up to make appreciable progress in the negotiations
7514373 the inclusion of forests in carbon markets enables developed countries to avoid real carbon emission reductions at home
7514374 the negotiations are focusing excessively on finance and not on the root causes of deforestation such as consumption of biofuels meat and timber
7514375 a ploy by developed countries to shy away from their commitments to reduced carbon emissions
7514376 there is no quota no limit to the number of filipino workers in kuwait
7514377 f or joe biden to talk about qualifications hes never run a city hes never run a state hes never run a business
7514378 i dont have to debate you because everyone already knows im right
7514379 as the problem continue and the fighting becomes intense we expect that our cost of war will further increase
7514380 neither the church nor the state has the authority or right to impose its will or preference for either natural or modern methods of family planning
7514381 it must be underscored that both natural and modern methods of family planning are contraceptives because their common objective is to prevent unwanted unplanned or untimely pregnancy
7514382 will be flawed if conducted under the threat of damnation or waged in churchyards and confessionals
7514383 catholics who refuse to sign against the measure should not be branded as pro abortion or threatened with excommunication neither should a homily of misinformation about the reproductive health bill precede the solicitation of signatures
7514384 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7514385 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7514386 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7514387 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7514388 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7514389 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7514390 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7514391 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7514392 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7514393 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7514394 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7514395 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7514396 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7514397 typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd from the comfort of moms basement
7514398 naturally gamers are not amused by the mccain campaigns quick resort to 80s era cultural stereotypes once mccain masters the internet were confident hell contemporize and start bashing video gamers instead
7514399 wields a fox cloak of deception with a 10 stun against nearby intelligent creatures
7514400 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7514401 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7514402 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7514403 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7514404 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7514405 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7514406 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7514407 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7514408 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7514409 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7514410 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7514411 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7514412 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7514413 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7514414 thus says the lord set your house in order for you shall die you shall not recover
7514415 please o lord remember how i have walked before you in faithfulness and with a whole heart and have done what is good in your sight
7514416 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7514417 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7514418 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7514419 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7514420 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7514421 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7514422 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7514423 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7514424 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7514425 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7514426 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7514427 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7514428 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7514429 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7514430 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7514431 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7514432 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7514433 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7514434 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7514435 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7514436 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7514437 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7514438 ive always felt like an expatriate with a red passport but if
7514439 sounds like ill be buying most of it when im there in october
7514440 thanks for sharing this info i think i will have to make a trip to
7514441 you have to sit by the side of a river a very long time before a roast duck will fly into your mouth
7514442 ideal to encrypt usb disks sticks secondary disks partitions cds dvds containers etc drivecrypt also allows to hide data in music files and create hidden containers partitions by entering the correct password the disks open if however you are forced to reveal a password you could reveal a pre configured fake password and the disk will open showing fake prepared information

7514445 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7514446 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7514447 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7514448 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7514449 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7514450 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7514451 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7514452 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7514453 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7514454 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7514455 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7514456 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7514457 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7514458 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7514459 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7514460 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7514461 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7514462 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7514463 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7514464 windmills should be installed in every uninhabited windy place in this country
7514465 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7514466 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7514467 my position is that a sensible jury would not expect people to be sniffing talcum powder
7514468 we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky
7514469 when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public
7514470 we arent jumping like we usually do we dont think he is going to tell the backstory so the whole thing just seems kind of icky when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public who want to share in celebrities lives no one really cared about clay aiken becoming a single dad either
7514471 when someone seems like they are hiding something its a big turnoff to the public who want to share in celebrities lives
7514472 no one really cared about clay aiken becoming a single dad either
7514473 in recent weeks ricky martin became a proud father by the birth of twin sons the children delivered via gestational ayyyy found this 3 days ago on
7514474 that would be like creating another japan or fighting world war ii all over again
7514475 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
7514476 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
7514477 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
7514478 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
7514479 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
7514480 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
7514481 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature

7514485 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7514486 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7514487 unang una gusto muna naming ipahatid ang aming pakikiramay sa nangyari sa kanyang ama congratulation na rin sa baby but hindi pa kasi namin nakikita ang baby
7514488 actually wala na kasi kaming communication ever since nag change siya ng phone number at si patrick wala naman dito actually this is my first na magbati
7514489 si patrick kasi wala siya rito hes out of the country actually kasi si patrick hindi niya dinala ang cell phone niya iniwanan niya tapos hindi naman niya alam ang nangyayari rito kasi the last time na nag usap kami wala pa namang ganoong pangyayari
7514490 ay ayokong pangunahan kasi yung mga plano nila marami pa silang dapat pag usapan magkaintindihan at si patrick hes already an adult so im giving him all the liberty para planuhin ang life niya kung hihingi sila ng payo nandito lang kami kung hindi naman nila kailangan nandito lang kami kung kailangan nila ng tulong namin
7514491 actually kasi hindi ko alam yung feeling kasi unang una first time tapos meron din naman akong grandson sa mga pamangkin actually mga granddaughters hindi ko alam e

7514510 obama is doing very well with women voters but there is the other side
7514511 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief
7514512 at least i dont cake on the makeup like a trollop you c t
7514513 someone else more than half of clintons supporters are still not on board with obama the holdouts tend to like mccain more than obama and have more confidence in mccains ability to be commander in chief

7514519 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7514520 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7514521 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7514522 aside from producing green obama t shirts earlier this year the obama campaign has not yet displayed the rhetoric or resources necessary to win its share of the irish american vote
7514523 barack obama needs the huge irish american vote in closely fought pennsylvania battlegrounds like pittsburgh and the philadelphia suburbs there are similar pockets of irish american swing votes in other key states
7514524 to ignore this irish dimension serves to the advantage of the implicit republican appeal on racial issues like affirmative action and religious issues like abortion
7514525 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7514526 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7514527 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7514528 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7514529 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7514530 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7514531 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7514532 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7514533 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7514534 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7514535 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7514536 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7514537 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7514538 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7514539 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
7514540 zeb i think the main difference is gore is a politician whos learned to manipulate science while suzuki is a scientist whos learning to manipulate politics
7514541 it is no crime to be ignorant of economics which is after all a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a dismal science but it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance
7514542 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7514543 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7514544 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7514545 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7514546 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7514547 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7514548 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7514549 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7514550 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7514551 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7514552 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7514553 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7514554 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7514555 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7514556 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7514557 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7514558 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7514559 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7514560 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7514561 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7514562 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7514563 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7514564 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7514565 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment
7514566 to protest the arrogant conceit of the obama administration the republican members of his cabinet resign en masse i never wanted the job anyway comments postmaster general joe lieberman
7514567 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7514568 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7514569 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7514570 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7514571 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7514572 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7514573 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7514574 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7514575 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7514576 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7514577 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7514578 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7514579 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7514580 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7514581 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7514582 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7514583 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7514584 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7514585 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign

7514606 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7514607 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7514608 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7514609 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7514610 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday

7514614 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7514615 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7514616 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests

7514619 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7514620 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7514621 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7514622 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7514623 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7514624 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7514625 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7514626 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary

7514687 it just wasnt the law stuff my grandmother linda caucci died in the middle of the season before the michigan game i was very close to her
7514688 he didnt play as well as he could have i think he knows that
7514689 but now he seems to be his old self and thats important for us to be good we have to have a good centerfielder
7514690 it was tough to have a killer instinct when you have other things in your head
7514691 but after the preliminary hearing in may 2007 when no one testified against him and the judge still held him over that was the only time i saw a negative emotion
7514692 the message theyre sending is that football players can do whatever they want and theres no accountability
7514693 scirrotto shouldnt be on the team let alone a captain
7514694 he did what i think all of us would do and his teammates rallied around him i have no problem with that
7514695 i took a peek of it on the internet and i turned it off within minutes
7514696 thats no good for anybody to watch stuff like that
7514697 for me to be told i look like the donovan of old what year are you talking about
7514698 those were great years 2000 04 and hopefully we can put 2008 in that category too
7514699 hes made a lot of plays so far but we have to stay patientwith him
7514700 he is a rookie hes just learning we havent gone into a full game plan for a regular game im sure that hell be able to handle that but you just want to kind of walk him in slowly and get everybody else opportunities to make plays as well
7514701 its a tough situation to go through especially being at the wide receiver position where you have to do a lot of cuts its going to be tough for him i actually told him to get the surgery because i think its important to get it done early before it becomes a real problem later
7514702 maybe some of those playmakers are already on the roster but have struggled with injuries myself included that have held us back a little
7514703 ive said that we are going to go where 5 and no 36 brian westbrook lead us thats not going to change any time soon i hope
7514704 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7514705 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7514706 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7514707 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7514708 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7514709 its reasonable to discuss already today the transdniestr problem i see good chances for solving it
7514710 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7514711 this is a serious warning for us all it is in this context that we should view the question of transdniestr resolution

7514752 acknowledging persistent unease with mr obama among a significant segment of voters
7514753 said they would use speeches and presentations during the next four days including having al gore introduce mr obama for his acceptance speech thursday night to offer a fuller biography and a more detailed plan of what he would do as president
7514754 said sunday he hoped a week of political speechmaking would persuade reluctant middle class voters to swing behind

7514758 since january when biden dropped out of the presidential race he and obama have quietly worked to smooth over their disagreements and biden has sought to erase divisions between the two of them on iraq sources say
7514759 longstanding ties to trial lawyers and lobbyists and a taste for pork barrel spending
7514760 wouldnt be allowed to contribute money to his fathers vice presidential effort
7514761 tapped as his running mate a man whose dramatic life story rivals his own and holds political appeal far beyond the foreign policy expertise that is bidens most obvious asset
7514762 was his status as chairman of the senate foreign relations committee which should help counter republican charges that mr obama lacks the experience to be commander in chief
7514763 sen obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength its quite clear from all of the commentaries all of the things ive heard from democrats in particular the strong choice would have been hillary clinton
7514764 i think the selection of joe biden really is an admission or acknowledgement that barack obama did not have that experience did not have those credentials as joe biden hillary clinton evan bayh and others said about barack obama
7514765 it was a pick made from weakness it is a pick that in effect acknowledges i was being wounded on the commander in chief lack of foreign policy experience issue and i picked the most experienced democratic senator in foreign policy

7514768 hinges on winning a handful of reliably republican states atop the list colorado
7514769 increasingly looks to be a tight race for the white house employing such an unconventional electoral map is more than desirable for the democrats it may be a necessity
7514770 betting that this time colorado and the west may just go their way in recent years democratic governors have replaced republicans in what used to be solidly red montana wyoming new mexico arizona and colorado
7514771 with its nine electoral votes and a surging population colorado may be the bellwether state
7514772 nowhere in the country is the race so close as in
7514773 nowhere is the electorate as much in flux as it is across the mountain west by far the fastest growing region in the nation with millions of new residents coming for fresh starts better jobs and stunning vistas and bringing loose political affiliations
7514774 sees signs that many of the new arrivals are inclined its way
7514775 that obama punished clinton for criticizing him during their long and often heated primary battle for the democratic presidential nomination
7514776 then says that obama deliberately slighted clinton by passing over her to pick delaware sen joe biden as his vice presidential running mate
7514777 also pointed out that mr biden before abandoning his own presidential candidacy had questioned whether mr obama was ready for the presidency

7514782 far too politic to refer to the commander in chiefs may 1 2003 declaration of mission accomplished but petraeus acknowledged that this policy of modesty in the face of success is very much informed by our premature victory ejaculations of previous years before he took charge of course

7514862 the olympics have increased chinese peoples confidence at first there was a lot of criticism but since the opening ceremony and the start of the games theres been widespread praise and this comes in a year where our confidence was shaken by natural disasters and other events
7514863 china is trying to show to the world this face that they are a modern progressing country thats open access for everyone and it really is not the truth the real face is one that denies freedom of speech that denies it brutally and violently when it can
7514864 perhaps some of the western governments and human rights organizations had it a little bit backwards where they expected that the olympics would be a time for more freedom
7514865 i think the government and i think theres substantial popular support for this view view the olympics in a very different way as a time to have temporary controls on society
7514866 after i was released i was afraid to stay alone in the dark i dont know why when i enter into a dark room i get frightened i immediately switch on the light and run away

7514868 they locked him in a shed all by himself with rats in the darkness before he was kidnapped he was never afraid but after that he became terrified of the dark he goes to bed very late at night and he can only sleep after exhausting himself he insists on burying his head under my arm to feel safe when he sleeps
7514869 i have a female she is 13 years old she exposed to kidnapped they raped her and made sexual intercourse with her for about 4 days daily
7514870 especially in children especially in the female any psychological problem is a stigma
7514871 they deny the disease but when we examine the child we discover many problems
7514872 i think the government concern about the security and other issues but of course you have a big problems of our children

7514934 why should the german be interested in the liberation of the jew if the jew is not interested in the liberation of the german we recognize in judaism therefore a general anti social element of the present time in the final analysis the emancipation of the jews is the emancipation of mankind from judaism indeed in north america the practical domination of judaism over the christian world has achieved as its unambiguous and normal expression that the preaching of the gospel itself and the christian ministry have become articles of trade money is the jealous god of israel in face of which no other god may exist

7514949 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget

7514992 between 1982 and 1987 mccain had received 112 000 in political contributions from keating and his associates
7514993 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
7514994 is one of the most stirring narratives ever told on the presidential trail a trail full of heroic war stories
7514995 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
7514996 this is a guy who lived in one house for five and a half years in prison
7514997 the senator has even brought his military record into discussion of his music tastes explaining that his favorite song was dancing queen by abba he offered that his knowledge of music stopped evolving when his plane intercepted a surface to air missile dancing queen however was produced in 1975 eight years after mccains plane was shot down
7514998 so the fact is that we have homes and im grateful for it ill continue to say i am blessed and very proud that jim hensley a war hero a man who barely graduated from high school was able to pass on to his daughter what he struggled for and saved for thats the ambition that all of us have for our children and grandchildren if someone wants to disparage that they are free to do that
7514999 examines the roots of the hensley fortune and john mccains implacable bond to the liquor industry how it has enriched him personally and as a politician and how those ties have dictated his actions on questions of public policy the hensley saga meanwhile swirls with bygone accounts of illicit booze gambling horse racing deceit and crime james hensley embarked on his road to riches as a bootlegger a 1948 federal criminal indictment charged the hensleys made approximately 1 284 false entries related to the sale of thousands of cases of liquor by their two companies united sales company in phoenix and united distributors in tucson

7515002 father rungi said that he expected many who applied to be young attractive and non italian
7515003 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7515004 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year
7515005 a substantial majority of voters in five large european union countries want a referendum on the blocs new reform treaty according to a poll published thursday
7515006 in lisbon and to avoid another defeat the managers of the eu have decided not to hold any referenda at all
7515007 this is crossing the rubicon after which there will be no more sovereign states in europe with fully fledged governments and parliaments which represent legitimate interests of their citizens but only one state will remain basic things will be decided by a remote federal government in brussels and for example czech citizens will be only a tiny particle whose voice and influence will be almost zero we are against a european superstate
7515008 as the former british prime minister of england during the late 1800s benjamin disraeli wrote
7515009 the irish government is especially wary of being seen to be offering a prescription to the people before it even receives an analysis of why the people voted no the results of a major survey of public opinion on the referendum will be received next month and taoiseach brian cowen will then bring his analysis of why the plebiscite was defeated to other eu heads of government
7515010 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe

7515058 its only a small minority of parents who fail to do the right thing by their children by ensuring they are enrolled in school and getting the start in life they deserve
7515059 the fact we offer extensive support to parents facing difficult situations means there are no excuses
7515060 its also sensible we act in this way as when a young child isnt attending school it can be a warning sign that there are serious problems at home
7515061 it is sad that court action is the only way to make a small number of parents understand and fulfil their responsibilities
7515062 the department is prosecuting the parents of children as young as six seven and eight if they neglect their responsibilities and fail to ensure their children go to school without an acceptable reason

7515067 maternity leave is old news for companies looking to retain talent now its dads turn kpmg is among a growing number of companies with programs typically aimed at mothers like telecommuting from home working flexible schedules and taking leave when a new baby arrives who are also focusing on fathers
7515068 the need for a varied work schedule affects both men and women but caring for the children still falls heavily on the mother nearly half of the workforce is now female and about 85 of working women are or will become working mothers this makes flex time a key issue for many women
7515069 its our dearest wish that mamadou wears the national jersey again not only to give him pleasure but his fellow citizens too

7515072 the tribute to ted kennedy is not only going to be emotional but it is also going to be political in its motivations
7515073 the idea is of course to stir memories of prior democratic champions and to link obama with them
7515074 i think obama is an amazing candidate and i think he will be an excellent president and i am very excited about working with him for him
7515075 told through a combination of original interviews archival footage and still photographs that chronicle his enormous contributions to this country
7515076 so i think for all our family this is incredibly emotional
7515077 even republicans are going to have to say give him his due hes been there for a long time
7515078 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off
7515079 so far the public has only seen the sound bites and the youtube version and you have not heard from michelle
7515080 it will be a proud moment to see the unedited version the smart graceful harvard educated lawyer mother and supportive spouse
7515081 the muttering you hear is that she has a little too much edge
7515082 shes too smart and too accomplished to stand out there and smile for 15 minutes the challenge is to get up there smooth and charming and not have too much attitude
7515083 it is intended to be very personal open and very revealing about who they are
7515084 america will know their values their life decisions and what drew them to one another
7515085 spouses arent viewed as being as threatening or as partisan as their husbands
7515086 because they are not running for office themselves they can do things voters of both sides of the aisle can appreciate involving illiteracy health care the environment or children they often have the background to make those kinds of things credible
7515087 her legs are olympic standard shes in fantastic shape you wont find a fitter bird than her
7515088 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7515089 we wanted to reach out to the best folks in the business on what wed like to see as a forward looking technology strategy on everything from how to get more people engaged to information and data security
7515090 the tac has been a way for us to pull best practices from the private and public sectors
7515091 we built a brand new network because the network in place at the pepsi center could not handle the demand
7515092 we started by building a structure in the pepsi center which is essentially a main office and went underground to feed to customers
7515093 we essentially had to duplicate a lot of the infrastructure
7515094 as an example dnccs staff will be able to move among venue locations like invesco field and the hyatt hotel at the convention center with their cisco ip phones as they relocate depending on their changing functions
7515095 we are taking all of the steps that people would expect us to take
7515096 but were not going to talk a lot about them
7515097 weve added firewalls in place and weve got equipment in place to capture any kind of attacks
7515098 why do we turn our back on a president who has not turned his back on us
7515099 the day will come that we will thank him for what hes doing
7515100 he understands what it means to fight a war somewhere else rather than inside our own boundaries
7515101 we have a nominee and hes going to be a good president
7515102 voters are divided over whether mccain would continue bushs policies thats one reason why mccain is competitive imagine what this election would look like if george w bush were running for re election or vice president dick cheney were running to succeed him
7515103 the republican party and mccain are being by helped by the recent crisis between the republic of georgia and russia anything that heightens concern over national security is likely to be good for mccain
7515104 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7515105 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests

7515115 advancing this work through the open standards process offers tangible benefits for device and platform vendors developers and consumers alike
7515116 these standards will enable the development of a new generation of enterprise enabled resources which can be automatically discovered and then function seamlessly together
7515117 this work will make it possible for a wide variety of devices to find each other and interoperate using web services techniques
7515118 the project will leverage existing basic web services methods to expand the scope of soa networks to a much broader range of machines and endpoints
7515119 ws dd is complementary to standards such as uddi and it will help improve the scale and flexibility of applications through the improved dynamic discovery of devices such as smart phones and services that may not be connected ca will continue to work closely with other industry leaders to enable a new generation of management security and governance solutions that support these more dynamic flexible applications
7515120 the formation of the ws dd technical committee is an important milestone and builds upon mature ws base protocols by expanding the scope to include the wide variety of devices being used today in homes and enterprises defining protocols for discovering securely consuming and exposing web services in a lightweight footprint that suits these devices has the potential to greatly broaden the reach of web services to meet customers needs discovery of enterprise resources whether devices or web services can help make large scale soa implementations more robust and simpler to manage
7515121 red hat is pleased to be involved with ws dd as we believe this is an important missing piece of the ws standardization effort particularly as it applies to the ongoing move towards more autonomous and large scale infrastructures that we are seeing being developed
7515122 a lightweight protocol for locating and identifying web services instances dynamically within an ad hoc environment should prove invaluable for enterprise level monitoring of soa landscapes by building upon the ws discovery specification we can address such requirements in a pragmatic and interoperable manner as the co author of the original specification were delighted to take a leadership role in advancing this standard further through the formation and work of the new technical committee in oasis
7515123 the only way we will be successful is if we are unified as a party and all democrats know we are full partners
7515124 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november

7515152 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7515153 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7515164 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7515165 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7515166 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7515167 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7515168 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7515169 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7515170 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7515171 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7515172 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7515173 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7515174 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7515175 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7515176 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7515177 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7515178 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7515179 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7515180 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7515181 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7515182 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7515183 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7515184 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7515185 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7515186 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7515187 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7515188 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7515189 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7515190 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7515191 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7515192 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7515193 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7515194 who are open to doing something on the production side
7515195 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7515196 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7515197 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7515198 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7515199 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7515200 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7515201 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7515202 viet nams lawyers can now approach a new and potential service market thanks to the countrys accession into the global economy to strong foreign investment flow and to diversified business forms
7515203 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7515204 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7515205 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7515206 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7515207 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7515208 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7515209 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7515210 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7515211 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7515212 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7515213 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7515214 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7515215 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7515216 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7515217 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7515218 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7515219 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7515220 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7515221 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7515222 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7515223 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7515224 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7515225 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7515226 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7515227 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7515228 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7515229 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7515230 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7515231 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7515232 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7515233 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7515234 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7515235 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7515236 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7515237 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7515238 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7515239 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7515240 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7515241 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7515242 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7515243 ive never had the chance to join any associations for the disabled my friends and i only gather together informally to meet and talk we all hope that these associations will be set up and will help us to gain access to better job opportunities public activities and individual assistance
7515244 its been quite candidly pretty tough some of the time

7515247 each hereditary disease is a sign of one or more errors in dna
7515248 todays genetics technology can find these errors in each person and warn them of the potential that they may acquire a certain disease
7515249 dna disease detection cards could be personalised to find remedies for each disease and each person
7515250 the final aim is to give an early diagnosis and improve prevention to boost living standards and longevity
7515251 dna cards have become popular around the world proving their obvious value
7515252 generally speaking viet nams dna technologies can not catch up with world standards for the time being but dna technologies for identification and disease detection purposes in the country are very close to world standard
7515253 its very important some of my relatives have died of several different diseases
7515254 i really want to know whether my children and i carry the germs for these diseases so that if they are in danger theres the possibility of early intervention
7515255 what would happen if the cards could not be kept confidential for some reasons
7515256 perhaps some couples who want to get married may require each other to show each others cards and that may be the root of an unhappy ending for some

7515302 thats driven by the immigration debate the way republicans handled the immigration debate was one of the most extraordinary political mistakes a party has made in recent times
7515303 the way hispanics have been alienated because of immigration has made it much more difficult for mccain to win the election
7515304 this cycle were competing in a number of districts that have significant hispanic populations
7515305 democrats are saying the system is broken and needs to be fixed and republicans were in the majority and couldnt get it done

7515307 candidates recognize the system is broken and are committing to addressing it when they get into office
7515308 in the latter part of this century or the next mexicans will be a majority in many of the states and could therefore take control of the state government using the democratic process
7515309 they could then secede from the united states and then we might have another civil war
7515310 they have an allegiance to mexico where they were taught the u s fought an unjust war with mexico and took this territory

7515313 i think jack davis rant says it all he thinks we are going to go to war with california and arizona
7515314 this is probably why his handlers wont let him debate and hide him from the press
7515315 we should address our illegal problems thoughtfully not by demonizing anyone
7515316 hes feeding an environment of intolerance that doesnt distinguish between legal and illegal immigrants
7515317 hes presenting our whole community as invaders people who want to take over the country
7515318 our country has been invaded occupied and settled by 10 million illegal aliens
7515319 my remarks at the center were designed to bring urgency to the conversation
7515320 i believe passionately in protecting our homeland and securing our borders if my language was hyperbolic the danger it described certainly is not
7515321 i think building a double wall long the southern border is the least expensive long term solution to maintaining the heritage of our fathers
7515322 the farmers overall would be really concerned about his statement
7515323 hes not a regular farmer hes one of these big guys id call him a multinational farmer
7515324 we are a nation of immigrants but we are also a nation of laws
7515325 require the people already here to learn english pay taxes and get in line for citizenship at their own expense
7515326 its not practical to deport millions of people but we cant reward or encourage further illegal entry into the united states with special rights or privileges
7515327 corporate greed creates the demand for cheap labor which draws immigrants from across our borders and hurts law abiding american workers
7515328 well their money doesnt impress me and i wont take a dime there is a safe and sane solution that puts employers and labor on the same side of the law and we must work together to find it without undue influence from special interests
7515329 my remarks at the center were designed to bring urgency to the conversation i believe passionately in protecting our homeland and securing our borders if my language was hyperbolic the danger it described certainly is not
7515330 our broken borders unsecured ports and lack of effective inspection and enforcement jeopardize the prosperity and security of americans every single day until we fix it we are vulnerable to another attack like we had in 2001 or worse and american workers and their families will continue to suffer

7515354 the governments failure to act fairly had left many people in limbo now they will be able to vote and participate fully in civic life
7515355 this suggestion that plaintiffs should be resigned to participate vicariously in civic society is shocking offensive and wrong it echoes the sentiments of those who challenged womans suffrage suggesting that women should be content to participate in the political process vicariously through their husbands votes

7515366 mr ganleys unexpected late withdrawal came as shock because he had personally assured me that he would be there to take part in the debate i feel badly let down by mr ganley for not keeping his word
7515367 faced with such heavyweights mr ganley has chickened out and made america his priority instead of honouring his commitment to take part in the only public forum on the difficulties facing ireland in the wake of last junes defeat of the lisbon referendum
7515368 declan ganley took part in extremely robust debates during the campaign i think its fairly clear that he hasnt chickened out of any opportunity to address anybody about the lisbon treaty
7515369 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in this is very much a personal view at this stage
7515370 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7515371 mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put that would not be a fair reflection the government is instead following the steps it said it would take in the wake of the referendum outcome
7515372 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu
7515373 we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7515374 in the view of the other member states we will be preventing the eu from equipping itself to deal with the many political and economic challenges facing todays europe
7515375 european affairs minister dick roche raised the prospect of a second lisbon treaty referendum last night saying he believes it is the appropriate response to the countrys continuing political crisis
7515376 the catholic primate of all ireland yesterday voiced fears that some christians had voted against the treaty because the eu was becoming ever more secular in its outlook
7515377 mr roche said if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7515378 some members of government may be relieved that the unpalatable truth is now being aired
7515379 a government spokesman said last night mr roche is not calling for a second referendum to be put
7515380 the differing views from senior members of church and state will this week reopen the entire lisbon debate but may not bring closer the finding of a solution that would ensure our continued full membership of the eu
7515381 ireland has been given until october to tell our partner states what we intend to do to rectify the situation
7515382 we now need to take a hard look at our situation within the eu mr roche said we have to recognise however that all other member states 26 sovereign democratic parliaments are likely to have ratified the treaty by the end of the year this will leave ireland in an isolated position
7515383 the european affairs minister privately does not see any chance of resolving the problem by trying to put elements of lisbon into irish law by passing bills in the dail if the legislative route was not adopted the first time out it could not be resorted to now he believes

7515393 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit

7515397 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7515398 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa believes that it will be able to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for
7515399 as long as russia can be said to be abiding by the terms of the cease fire in georgia
7515400 there is an issue but i dont think its so strong to prevent the waiver from passing as long as russian behavior is what it has been agreed to on georgia

7515408 this incident underlines why we believe it is irresponsible to leave scab managers in charge of any tube station not least a busy one with lifts
7515409 we understand that managers left floundering by the emergency delayed calling the fire brigade and that the fire service eventually responded to a call from one of the trapped passengers
7515410 under normal circumstances if it took more than 20 minutes to get people out managers would be demanding to know why it had taken so long and if it took more than an hour they would be looking for someone to discipline
7515411 safety reps tell me that the fail safe systems on the lifts at elephant and castle are unusual but the people normally staffing the station are familiar with them
7515412 instead of parachuting in scab managers without the training local experience and knowledge to cope when things go wrong lul should be sorting out the injustice to jerome bowes that has led to this dispute in the first place

7515455 we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to build on this moment
7515456 we were prepared for smog pollution demonstrations but everything has gone very smoothly
7515457 and so we believe the games had a good influence
7515458 the reality is that the chinese governments hosting of the games has been a catalyst for abuses leading to massive forced evictions a surge in the arrest detention and harassment of critics repeated violations of media freedom and increased political repression
7515459 not a single world leader who attended the games or members of the ioc seized the opportunity to challenge the chinese governments behavior in any meaningful way

7515476 the problem for domestic companies is that they now lag further behind their foreign counterparts
7515477 this is not going to be helpful as the big three will lose more pricing power and be forced to continue dependence on rebates and discounting in a market where consumer preferences keep shifting away from domestic cars
7515478 the american consumer has long been the single biggest force propping up the us and the global economy
7515479 but declining customer satisfaction combined with weaker demand for us exports may make it difficult for american households to shoulder the burden of being the locomotive for world economic growth

7515510 we were alerted by our telecommunications contractor sprint on saturday the 15th of august of a problem at our training center so we immediately blocked the capability for all international calls and monitored long distance calls

7515514 we want to do this as expeditiously as possible but efficiently and accurately as well
7515515 ensure theyre in a secure state at the end of the day

7515526 when we began rewriting our software as web based applications we wanted an authoring product that was optimized for the web and could provide true single sourcing that product was flare
7515527 we have been using flare since april 2006 and it is one of the best decisions weve made we havent looked back since
7515528 we were jumping into a new world with our software and documentation and it was time to look at a new authoring solution
7515529 we reviewed a number of products but most were based on older proprietary architectures we were attracted by madcap flares standards based native xml architecture we also liked the fact that flare is based on net and visual studio providing a lot of potential for seamless integration with our web based software
7515530 we love the snippets in flare its one of the things that has transformed our lives
7515531 now when we have an update we just go to the snippet source make the change and the change appears everywhere it just takes a few seconds its so much more efficient and there is a lot more control
7515532 our qc people say it has affected their process as well
7515533 before they had to review every topic and hope that a function or field was described the same way knowing that we use snippets they no longer have to eyeball every instance where a change occurs it adds a whole new level of certainty
7515534 our web based documentation has become such an asset that our sales team pitches it to prospects almost treating it like another application
7515535 flare makes our technical writing team feel like rock stars
7515536 basys has taken a strategic step in extending its market leadership by transforming its proven benefit plan applications into web enabled processes supported by state of the art web based documentation
7515537 we are thrilled by the role that our ground breaking native xml flare authoring software has played in enabling basys to deliver a world class customer experience along with superior quality control and productivity we look forward to supporting basys as it delivers new web optimized solutions and documentation for the future

7515540 who decides what the price band should be when companies like vodafone essar and bharti airtel can have a price band of around rs 800 900 how come the countrys number one telecom company is priced so low
7515541 the amount will go to the government and this might not necessarily be used for bsnls expansion

7515550 iran hasnt bought wheat from us since 1981 and of course we remember the political problems at that time with the hostages
7515551 but they are so desperate after a drought cut their crop down by a third this year so theyve purchased 43 million bushels of u s hard red winter wheat over the last three or four weeks
7515552 after i was released i was afraid to stay alone in the dark i dont know why when i enter into a dark room i get frightened i immediately switch on the light and run away
7515553 my son was held for seven days before they released him
7515554 they locked him in a shed all by himself with rats in the darkness before he was kidnapped he was never afraid but after that he became terrified of the dark he goes to bed very late at night and he can only sleep after exhausting himself he insists on burying his head under my arm to feel safe when he sleeps
7515555 i have a female she is 13 years old she exposed to kidnapped they raped her and made sexual intercourse with her for about 4 days daily
7515556 especially in children especially in the female any psychological problem is a stigma
7515557 they deny the disease but when we examine the child we discover many problems
7515558 i think the government concern about the security and other issues but of course you have a big problems of our children
7515559 i didnt see any child psychiatry center outside iraq we told the ministry we told the government they say they have no money for the training
7515560 we still dont have enough time to see all the conditions admitted to this hospital

7515581 maar de waarheid is dat sommige vrouwen pas kunnen klaarkomen door een trilling die niet kan bereikt worden door de mens de vibrator is een hulpmiddel geen vervanger
7515582 voor mannen is penetratie het grootste genot en meestal staan ze er niet bij stil dat dat voor vrouwen niet het geval is de binnenkant van de vagina is veel ongevoeliger dan de delen erbuiten
7515583 de hoeveelheid vaginaal vocht is afhankelijk van vrouw tot vrouw sommigen hebben er altijd veel anderen maar af en toe nog anderen maar zelden het kan veranderen met de hormonenspiegel of onder invloed van stress of medicatie

7515607 corsi intensivi per i prof del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola
7515608 non un 7 in condotta lintroduzione alla valutazione del comportamento pi un 5 in condotta perch con il 7 si viene promossi mentre questa insufficienza fa media e nei casi pi gravi viene lasciato alla discrezionalit del consiglio dei docenti prevedere la bocciatura
7515609 la scuola non deve essere unappendice del welfare non deve avere una funzione sociale ma deve svolgere una funzione educativa e formativa ha continuato il ministro abbiamo introdotto leducazione alla cittadinanza perch i ragazzi siano cittadini consapevoli dei propri diritti ma anche dei propri doveri e allo stesso tempo anche leducazione ambientale alla salute ai corretti stili di vita e leducazione stradale tutti i progetti che vanno a correggere lattuale progetto di educazione che non n condiviso n esaustivo
7515610 premiare il merito e introdurre una rivoluzione che indispensabile perch oggi c un livello di insoddisfazione generalizzato tra le famiglie e anche fra gli insegnanti ha proseguito il ministro occorre liberare le risorse oggi il 97 del bilancio del ministero viene utilizzato per pagare stipendi molto bassi la scuola stata utilizzata come uno stipendificio un modo per creare occupazione
7515611 un errore che credo sia stato commesso in buona fede ma che oggi paghiamo e facciamo pagare ai giovani il test elaborato da ocse pisa dice che la nostra scuola al 37esimo posto nella parte bassa della classifica una realt a cui porre rimedio
7515612 la finanziaria prevede una razionalizzazione delle spese e da l passa lintroduzione della meritocrazia e il 30 dei risparmi che andremo a produrre grazie a una riduzione degli sprechi sar cos possibile premiare chi disponibile a fare formazione continuativa chi raggiunge i migliori risultati

7515614 significativo siamo tutti preoccupati ma chi lo critica indichi una strada diversa
7515615 dove il bilancio ingessato chiaro che non ci sono margini abbiamo la necessit di fare qualche sacrificio oggi per rilanciare la scuola di domani ci assumiamo la responsabilit di procedere a una razionalizzazione indispensabile loccasione per rilanciare la qualit della didattica
7515616 la scuola elemento unificante dello stato e i programmi devono essere uguali per tutti ma la scuola si deve aprire al contesto territoriale e alzare la propria qualit abbassata dalle scuole del sud

7515723 if someone wants a prius they better put the order in
7515724 unless toyota sends a lot more cars were going to see prius wait lists spin out again to about six months
7515725 i think that we prius owners need a dating whatever program to hook us up with other prius owners
7515726 stems from my inability to look at people with gas burning cars as attractive
7515727 a big component of hybrid ownership is the social aspect
7515728 i do believe in global warming but the prius isnt the answer
7515729 every time i look at a prius it only reaffirms my belief that ultra liberals and poorly educated science environments are the worlds greatest threats go hug a tree prius buyers
7515730 there is a lot of interest in naturally grown food
7515731 but people do not seem to understand why it costs more
7515732 it was blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his 15 minutes of fame
7515733 my family is wonderful so very happy were all great
7515734 we love each other very much and want everyone to know that the matter was completely blown out of proportion
7515735 but it certainly could have a very subliminal effect it could degrade the brand
7515736 we tried not to play into their hands and be drawn into a provocation when they arrived and will try to continue this policy when they leave
7515737 orchestrated the entire malicious dirty campaign in time for this election
7515738 what is important to me is to win whether it is by a margin of one or 10 000 it doesnt matter
7515739 god willing we will perform well we will manage against all odds unless there is massive rigging
7515740 capable of bringing change that will benefit the people regardless of race
7515741 there was absolutely no noise it was very disturbing we only had time to swerve to the right before being mown down
7515742 we no longer have any hope of finding people alive

7515759 there is a good case to be made for the centrality of agency to any understanding of the meaning and purpose of the plan of salvation and the atonement of jesus christ which is its essential core after all if we were not moral agents no atonement would be necessary because we could not really sin
7515760 we cannot embrace both reductive biological naturalism and human agency
7515761 since both conceptual dimensions agency and indeterminism are anchored on one end by determinism it is common to conflate freedom and indeterminism since they both find themselves in opposition to determinism
7515762 mechanical and biological links are clearly destructive of agency as are stimulus response links governed by environmental forces requiring no active participation by an agentic person

7515772 we demand so much from our avid ds systems over the course of a week we may be asked to work on a wide range of projects from pal trailers to episodic television and effects work to 4 4 4 features that will be filmed out
7515773 weve been beta testing the new version of avid ds for a few months here on a variety of different projects we are very impressed with the performance improvements color management capabilities and the addition of the advanced color correction tools with secondaries having all those effects in real time in 4 4 4 is a tremendous timesaver our clients expect speed accuracy and style regardless of the type of project or how tight the deadline avid ds 10 is the perfect platform allowing us to continue meeting these needs for our clients
7515774 without question the avid ds system offers the highest quality integrated toolset for the online editorial process
7515775 the new real time secondary color correction feature is excellent and our clients love the grades we are able to add to their final product overall there are just loads of little extras and improvements that i keep stumbling upon which are huge timesavers and just another example of how avid has been really listening to the user base

7515809 the relationship was also personal with an mbna executives buying bidens house at a favorable price and one of his sons taking a job for a time as an mbna management trainee as the wilmington news journal reported hey its a small state
7515810 biden returned mbnas favor by delivering key democratic support for the companys top legislative goal the 2005 bankruptcy reform act which made it tougher for broke people to escape their credit card debt bidens staff says he forced lenders to add special protections for low wage workers and single mothers before he would back the bill
7515811 it makes it harder for average people to file for bankruptcy protection it makes it easier for landlords to evict a bankrupt tenant it endangers child support payments by giving a wider array of creditors a shot at post bankruptcy income it allows millionaires to shield an unlimited amount of equity in homes and asset protection trusts it makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize while opening new loopholes for the enrons of the world it allows creditors to provide misleading information and it does nothing to rein in lending abuses that frequently turn manageable debt into unmanageable crises even in failure ordinary americans do not get a level playing field

7515853 the privacy youre concerned about is largely an illusion all you have to give up is your illusions not any of your privacy
7515854 if the nineteenth century was a world of privacy and prudery a world of closed doors and drawn blinds
7515855 then the world of the twenty first century is the world of the one way mirror the world of the all seeing eye
7515856 obviously if youre a terrorist privacy is enormously important so the more we think of privacy as endangering us that will reinforce these commercial incentives to surrender privacy

7515867 we all need to do our part and make changes for the better
7515868 there can be some smugness on the part of the prius owners because its distinctive
7515869 if someone wants a prius they better put the order in

7515871 i think that we prius owners need a dating whatever program to hook us up with other prius owners

7515876 there is a lot of interest in naturally grown food
7515877 but people do not seem to understand why it costs more
7515878 if i could find a hybrid in my price range then it would make sense for me and i would buy one
7515879 i dont love love love how it looks but i sure do like the idea of it

7515885 we put the bodies in the main mosque he told the associated press by phone sometimes pausing to collect himself as he wept
7515886 most of these dead bodies were children and women it took all morning to collect them
7515887 they told the soldiers we dont need your food we dont need your clothes
7515888 i believe that all members of council want to support this request it is certainly a safety issue however i have serious questions and doubts about the applicant and their inability to meet the requests of staff
7515889 we are getting a major piece of infrastructure its going to have long term benefits to the community in terms of safety
7515890 i havent heard that is the case today so unfortunately i cannot support a full road closure which otherwise might have support of the neighbourhood just to get it over with
7515891 if it is the wish of council we are quite prepared to have that manned 24 hours a day to prevent other traffic from using that route
7515892 we have no problem with that it thats your desire
7515893 the ditch that has to be constructed is 10 feet deep and 30 feet wide the cranes required to swing the culvert pieces into place have to be positioned in such a way that they can swing back and forth without interference from the public
7515894 when we purchased this property from the majoros family to develop lakewind the pond and marsh were included in the sale but were in need of rehabilitation says medican owner wesley reinheller

7515896 my administration will re organise the shoddy building plan to reflect the minna city master plan
7515897 it has produced good results so far as the best performers are from the clubs
7515898 we have learnt things that we did not know before
7515899 the pregnancy rate has decreased now we only have two to three cases unlike before
7515900 we use drama song folk tales to address issues that they consider taboo
7515901 the clubs provide a safety net for the girls to speak out more and counsel each other because sometimes they face similar circumstances
7515902 washington long before the mortgage crisis began rocking main street and wall street a top fbi official made a chilling if little noticed prediction the booming mortgage business fueled by low interest rates and soaring home values was starting to attract shady operators and billions in losses were possible it has the potential to be an epidemic chris swecker the fbi official in charge of criminal investigations told reporters in september 2004 but he added reassuringly the fbi was on the case we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis he said today the damage from the global mortgage meltdown has more than matched that of the savings and loan bailouts of the 1980s and early 1990s by some estimates it has made that costly debacle look like chump change but its also clear that the fbi failed to avert a problem it had accurately forecast
7515903 or maybe disabilities issues grind your gears check pei disability alert you will find out all about it but not much about anything else
7515904 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7515905 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7515906 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7515907 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7515908 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7515909 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7515910 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry
7515911 we continue to see pressure on our market and the consumer generally
7515912 despite the macroeconomic conditions we saw improved execution in our merchandising and operations initiatives during the past quarter i am very proud of what our associates have accomplished in a difficult environment
7515913 burden the original decision of the woman and the physician
7515914 would essentially bar abortions because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child and if this is a child then this would be an anti abortion statute
7515915 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7515916 if this is a child then this would be an antiabortion statute
7515917 obama is a father of two young girls you can bet that attacks like that will get him or any father riled up that language seems to be way over the top his critics can paint him as a pro choice liberal thats fair but to go any further is really beyond the pale is obama really sinister a monster
7515918 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7515919 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7515920 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7515921 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7515922 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7515923 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7515924 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7515925 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system
7515926 ten years ago waits of 18 months were not uncommon but by the end of this year no one should wait longer than 18 weeks none of this would have been possible without the hard work and dedication of everyone working into he nhs
7515927 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7515928 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7515929 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7515930 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40
7515931 its clearly a strategy to eliminate our members and reverse our majority in parliament
7515932 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7515933 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations we dont need arrogance on the part of any of the parties we need maturity and harmony and not acrimony
7515934 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7515935 i really love wales so its great to have the chance to play at a big festival here instead of taking the motorway we took the road up through the brecon beacons i feel at home here
7515936 bryn has asked me to be involved for a few years but because of filming ive never been able to
7515937 we cant make torchwood toys we cant market to children because its an adult show maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
7515938 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible
7515939 i knew that there would definitely be an end to donna at the end of the series
7515940 but had that not been the case had it been open ended had there been potential for donna to stay for another series i must confess that id have said yes like a shot
7515941 could donna come back well in science fiction anything is possible

7515945 aggressive actions which result in the death of thousands of south ossetian civilians has with finality deprived the georgian leadership of the right to demand that the people of south ossetia and abkhazia be subject to its adventurist policy
7515946 it is hard to say what decision russias political leaders will make on our republics but i can say for certain that abkhazia and south ossetia will never be part of georgia
7515947 if they break off this cooperation as a matter fact it wont mean anything terrible to us
7515948 we are ready to make any decision up to an including terminating relations as a whole
7515949 we will position our men on the french naval ship to study large ships this would also be an exposure for them in terms of how large carriers work
7515950 the nuclear powered charles de gaulle would be good exposure for the indian naval officials as there are many issues like nuclear propulsion involved in operating a large aircraft carrier at sea
7515951 we sympathize with the bereaved members of the families who have lost their loved ones we call upon the orissa and central governments to bring to book immediately those responsible for this dastardly act

7515962 natos naval deployments in the black sea where nine foreign vessels have already been sent cannot but provoke concern

7515967 georgian reconnaissance and sabotage groups are reinvigorating their efforts and are preparing military actions along the routes of russian armored columns as well as acts of sabotage on transportation infrastructure
7515968 among the most pressing human rights concerns pertaining to the conflict was the return from both sides of the persons detained
7515969 at this difficult time both sides must be encouraged to respect core human rights principles and humanitarian law
7515970 such gestures of good will by both sides are important humanitarian acts to save lives to protect human rights of those victimized by the conflict and to start rebuilding mutual confidence between the parties
7515971 clearly the sinister agenda of this regime is to tilt the balance of numbers in their favour during the voting for the speaker of parliament

7515990 with mdc gone the future health care demands of our already under served community cant be met how will midwives be licensed without this accredited program
7515991 with the alarming rate of infant mortality and the growing racial health disparities in the state of florida it is foolish to eliminate the one program best suited to train more health professionals to address this crisis

7515999 kids will learn about their teammates living outside of the county and they will turn them in before the season starts they take it seriously
7516000 the school system has been working with the county to try to reinforce that we are diligent about our residency
7516001 by having the new residency verification process we can really help schools manage this issue
7516002 if we stay in the same address and we go to a school literally around the corner thats crazy
7516003 because id never written songs before we didnt know what the rules were
7516004 we didnt know you shouldnt write about the tasteless things going around in your head
7516005 this musical is coming from the mind of dana marschz the teacher and he doesnt think its funny and hes not trying to be offensive
7516006 the joke of it is that hes so damaged and hes trying to be so honest with his feelings but hes so limited with his abilities that it ends up being completely inappropriate
7516007 hes the son of god and i think thats cool
7516008 so why do i feel like ive been raped in the face
7516009 it maybe came out of frustration because we had seen so many musicals and we were trying to do something that was really funny
7516010 im not pretending these songs are as good as any musical ever
7516011 i hope people will think theyre a breath of fresh air

7516025 vamos a provocar que estados unidos aumente las deportaciones de hondure os o que no ampl e el estatus de protecci n temporal tps
7516026 no puedo comentar al respecto no he seguido sto y la misi n tampoco ha seguido sto
7516027 le repito que en estos momentos la misi n no sac este tema pero haremos las preguntas respecto a las implicaciones econ micas del alba ahorita ni he visto este tema

7516029 club de los ni os rebeldes en contra de eua nuestro principal socio comercial
7516030 los pueblos est n esperando que se resuelva la derogatoria de estos decretos los ind genas tenemos nuestra visi n sobre el desarrollo respetamos mucho lo que diga el presidente garc a pero los ind genas creemos que esto es un avance para dejar por sentado que el desarrollo se da con respeto y responsabilidad para nosotros no es un retroceso es avanzar en el estado de derecho que plantea nuestra visi n del desarrollo en el pa s
7516031 nosotros ya hemos manifestado que tenemos clara nuestra agenda tenemos una para trabajar con el ejecutivo y otra para trabajar con la presidencia del congreso de la rep blica nosotros vamos a seguir dialogando con el gobierno aidesep tiene muchas propuestas por conversar
7516032 hemos aprendido muchas cosas a ra z de todo esto una de ellas es el respeto al derecho de los ciudadanos porque estos decretos legislativos no afectan solo a los pueblos ind genas sino que tambi n caen sobre los pueblos de los andes nosotros no queremos da ar la gobernabilidad queremos ayudar a que la pol tica se lleve siempre dentro del marco del respeto
7516033 los pueblos est n pendientes de la decisi n final del ejecutivo
7516034 los pueblos est n muy pendientes de esto no creo que solamente la selva los andinos tambi n ya est n prepar ndose para escuchar el resultado final este proceso de di logo debe continuar de una manera m s organizada
7516035 de unos 13 o 14 a os para ac al parecer cuando entr en vigor el famoso tlc tratado de libre comercio de am rica del norte la gente ya no compr ni los jorongos ni las cobijas de lana las sustituyeron por chamarras y frazadas de fibras sint ticas de origen chino mucho m s baratas pero de menor calidad
7516036 con el aprovechamiento de los desperdicios ampliamos nuestra variedad de productos pero ni as ganamos m s
7516037 como la venta de jorongos ya no deja y el dinero no alcanza
7516038 yo por ejemplo aparte de tejer mantengo a mi familia con el apoyo del programa setenta y m s pero tambi n trabajo en la siembra de ma z y de frijol
7516039 nos dijeron que nos dar an apoyo pero que si quer amos crecer tendr amos que modernizarnos y para ello deb amos comprar unos telares seg n m s sofisticados hicimos el esfuerzo conseguimos unos ya usados y nunca sirvieron mis compa eros tuvieron que empe ar una camioneta para juntar el dinero

7516046 then you have ais that can make mistakes for us that turned out to be a very interesting and important foundational idea
7516047 were all really excited about halo wars because from everything weve seen so far its a very cool faithful adaptation
7516048 in halo 1 we wanted to find little behavioural roles that we could teach the player about how ais react to certain things
7516049 ai has developed to a point where a lot of the big problems that were solving are not really ai problems at all theyre animation problems
7516050 this is how you play this animation and this is how you move in this particular direction
7516051 no no you think you want to do ai but you really want to do animation
7516052 spore for example is a fantastic piece of work theyve started to take a much more procedural approach to animation
7516053 theres an interesting dichotomy between what appears hard and what actually is hard
7516054 drivers practiced their routes last week so we fully expect everything to go smoothly today
7516055 we can now see real time live where every hisd bus is
7516056 it made a really big difference in my life and i didnt want it to just go away
7516057 i wanted to do as much as i could to bring mount carmel back
7516058 its the weather conditions when its raining outside they still have to walk that long distance
7516059 im probably going to get exercise but im a little bit scared too
7516060 i dont want to walk that far at almost the crack of dawn
7516061 hands take longer to get to the wheel when youre on the phone
7516062 sure you can call it the bug and run it over project all the bad things your brother does to you onto it and itll be a snap bam one less toad
7516063 cmon bug if you knew you were going to completely get away with it would you pee on me
7516064 imagine he knows everything you do about this business but thinks like a child
7516065 because of the cost of making the playstation 3 and because they sold it at a loss sony basically has pretty much no chance of making money on the ps3 because its lost more money than they made during the entire peak of the playstation 2 its not going to happen again for sony
7516066 if they release the playstation 4 and have an even more expensive console and raise the cost of games by ten dollars that would not be good
7516067 this is going to force them to make the ps3 last longer and theyre kind of positioning to do that
7516068 tons of people might be contenders right down to the last week thats what people want lots of competition and unpredictable things happening
7516069 we thought wed focus on good characters and lots of things could happen its a show that makes itself in some ways
7516070 de dood van de jongeren is telkens weer een grote schok voor de omgeving het moet nu afgelopen zijn
7516071 anything and everything could turn up in the collection from charles lindberghs goggles to a bearskin coat that belonged to custer
7516072 im shocked by the video when i look at amy i think for christs sake just get a grip of yourself
7516073 enough is enough as the police know amy is a drug addict and she has now been caught twice on film taking illegal drugs they should arrest her and put her behind bars
7516074 rehab clinics are a waste of money unless you want them to work amy doesnt want to give up drugs so shes got to learn the hard way in prison
7516075 police have to act she is making a mockery of the law it has got to stop the price amy has got to pay is losing her freedom
7516076 a blunder that makes you look ridiculous used in the phrase make a spectacle of yourself
7516077 id say were up at least 10 percent in renting space
7516078 you know i think its just a big event its a well known flea market and the people just kind of like to come to it
7516079 all the vendors seemed to be happy they made money
7516080 should be prepared for new traffic patterns and considerable traffic delays
7516081 it may be a bigger crowd because of the gas prices
7516082 if the public finds out about this it will look bad that will erode confidence eroded confidence will undermine the system
7516083 an act of a man or a woman who believing in the public interest overrides the interest of the organization he serves and publicly blows the whistle if the organization is involved in corrupt illegal fraudulent or harmful activity
7516084 eine moschee zu bauen das ist ein eiertanz par excellence

7516104 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach
7516105 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7516106 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
7516107 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue
7516108 past research has shown that the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can positively impact the bodys immune defense3 and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract
7516109 its been black and white from day one with the sfa

7516118 dass das projekt mit dem namen tiger woods verbunden ist bedeutet f r uns einen enormen wertzuwachs und wir sind stolz darauf ihm einige der wichtigsten fortschritte vorstellen zu k nnen die wir seit seinem letzten besuch vor ort erzielt haben
7516119 ich bin stolz auf meine partnerschaft mit tatweer die bei der umsetzung des
7516120 das gesamtkonzept spiegelt die erstaunlichen dimensionen wider die dieses projekt mittlerweile angenommen hat gleichzeitig unterstreicht das konzept die tatsache dass es sich hier um eines der ehrgeizigsten bauprojekte der welt handelt die landschaftliche gestaltung von al ruwaya wird genau jene elemente widerspiegeln die ich am golfsport liebe und ich hoffe dass es sich als ein anspruchsvoller und sorgf ltig durchdachter golfplatz f r spieler aller spielst rken erweisen wird
7516121 the matter is important we are ready to hear it
7516122 we are extending the stay on the tribunals order by another six weeks
7516123 efforts would also be made to invite bronze medal winner pugilist vijendra kumar to inspire the young talents of the state
7516124 we were really proud of her its amazing what she has achieved she is an incredibly bright pupil the school made a really big deal of her achievement she will be representing the british people in beijing
7516125 they gave her such a shock she had been hoping she would win but i dont think she could believe it when she actually did
7516126 she is definitely excited about it she was really looking forward to going and it was quite emotional for her
7516127 the scrip is already oversold it might witness a knee jerk reaction for 1 2 days if tata motors pulls out of the singur plant there is still a lot of support for the scrip
7516128 i made a major investment here to move is going to be a great cost to the company and great cost to tata motors shareholders and i think its going to be a great cost to west bengal
7516129 watched it being cut into pieces by his partners in crime
7516130 do i think its a mans world in television that is the most ridiculous question i have been asked all week
7516131 the worst thing you can be in this industry is a middle class white male if any middle class white male i come across says he wants to enter television i say give up all hope theyve no chance
7516132 he lists women because he couldnt possibly name all the men in positions of power in tv because he would be there all bloody day he talks about middle class white men being a beleaguered species on bbc well excuse me but jonathan ross jeremy on newsnight look at the today programme have i got news for you newsnight it seems to me that tv is a fantastic place for middle class white males
7516133 unfortunately hes very out of touch with reality with whats going on in tv there is a failure to represent women in terms of news and political content
7516134 sixty per cent of television viewing of bbc one and most channels is done by women and it was hard for broadcasters to find large male audiences except for sports programmes
7516135 this is the first time he has been sore in his life he had the softest of trials and pulled up without a problem on the way back to capel i called into the vets at lark hill just to make sure everything was ok and when we trotted him up his was lame
7516136 it is not a serious problem but when you are heading across to victoria to take on the best horses in the land everything must be 100
7516137 that is not the case so well now aim him at the summer carnival here at ascot which i am sure will make everyone at perth racing happy
7516138 i know it will be difficult to defend his railway stakes crown because horses just dont win the race with big weights
7516139 it certainly brought us back down to earth very quickly
7516140 but it only balances up the freakish good run we had last summer and hopefully he can get amongst the winners again this year
7516141 god willing we will perform well we will manage against all odds unless there is massive rigging any independent observer will concede we have an edge
7516142 we will go on a token strike wednesday and if the government goes ahead with its decision to disinvest we will go on an indefinite strike
7516143 it is debt free and has a net worth of rs 750 billion any bank will give loans to the company for expansion
7516144 who decides what the price band should be when companies like vodafone essar and bharti airtel can have a price band of around rs 800 900 how come the countrys number one telecom company is priced so low
7516145 the amount will go to the government and this might not necessarily be used for bsnls expansion
7516146 telecom companies like mtnl mahanagar telephone nigam ltd hindustan cables and iti ltd who listed themselves on the stock exchange are now loss making companies for the past five years
7516147 we have been assured by the telecom minister that the government will not proceed without the trade unions consent

7516170 investigates the role of the saudi arabian religious establishment in spreading a hard line fundamentalist islamic ideology in the uk the very ideology the government claims to be tackling
7516171 preachers proclaim the supremacy of islam preach hatred for non muslims and for muslims who do not follow their extreme beliefs and predict a coming jihad
7516172 i was appalled by some of the things we saw it must be investigated i want to know what this stuff was and why it took a tv documentary to expose it the mosque must know what is happening inside its building
7516173 its deeply disturbing that this preaching of hate is still going on there should be a further investigation into the bookshop and what these people are preaching
7516174 with digital media becoming such an integral part of our daily lives consumers are looking for a simple and convenient way to enjoy recently purchased music movies or tv programming anytime anywhere

7516306 when the taliban fell and i decided to come back to afghanistan some of my family was not happy with me
7516307 my three sons even did not come back with me but my wife and daughter did and we now live and work in kabul
7516308 when we heard from the ministry of education in kabul that they desperately needed land for a school my wife encouraged me to give this land here for a girls school
7516309 she had to move away from panjshir to get an education and she didnt want the girls today to have to do the same thing
7516310 it is a good thing that his family was willing to give their personal land for a girls school because good useable land is getting very hard to find here in panjshir
7516311 when i decided to come back to afghanistan a good friend of mine from holland asked me why i would want to leave the netherlands for afghanistan
7516312 i told him that i was sure that as long as coalition forces were here helping our government then i knew it would be a good safe place to come
7516313 i am very happy that i made the decision to come back to afghanistan because i can do something for the people here for my people

7516315 i remember having a conversation with a friend several years ago about how when a tv show starts losing its ratings they will almost always bring in a celebrity to try and revive it
7516316 i think someone at microsoft marketing must be from the tv industry
7516317 somehow i doubt that was the kind of comparison microsoft was hoping to make
7516318 what could be more appropriate than using professional comedians as vista pitchmen
7516319 i wish theyd use judy tenuta now that would be ads that bite
7516320 and they blew it and then they blew the second impression too
7516321 i cant imagine what they think seinfeld can do to help my customers wont go near vista at this point and i doubt anything other than a new os release would fix that
7516322 if thats what they are planning it will backfire big time i can see random insults moving things from the average person hating vista to the average person hating microsoft no one likes being told theyre an idiot
7516323 the perfect spokesman for windows built on technology developed before the internet well known but not very relevant and even though you really cant avoid windows nobody is fanatical about it
7516324 that really has a synergy with seinfeld you can turn on any broadcast channel in any city in america and be sure theyre playing episodes of seinfeld but nobody is actually a regular viewer of those episodes
7516325 as much as seinfeld was great during its heyday watching it today very clearly dates it and exposes that its not as timeless as theyd like you to believe
7516326 i fear that by drawing on this star of the 90s microsoft may be showing its longing to return to a time when buying a computer meant buying windows
7516327 short of every linux distro calling home which i hope will never happen there may never be a way to know how many linux users there are
7516328 perhaps the downloads of some cross platform application would give a rough idea but that application would have to be something that a linux user a mac user and a windows user would want equally if anyone has a better idea i would love to hear it
7516329 although its difficult to tell how many people are using linux microsoft must have a very good idea of how many people are not using vista
7516330 its a bit though not entirely like trying to calculate the market value of food from a home kitchen compared to that of restaurant meals
7516331 measurement of prices paid is not the only difficult task
7516332 you also have to consider the cost of sampling dont like ubuntu try fedora quickly and free opportunity costs for the software itself a low price now even for what is perceived as lower quality goods in some contexts means money available for other things and freedom to experiment and recombine perhaps windows makes sense for some people in a given organization but the data entry might taste just as good if done on linux based thin terminals
7516333 makes less sense as a concept when the market is as fluid as the free software world
7516334 machines dual boot are repurposed are used as vm hosts or serve apps to dozens of other machines which may or may not be running the same os in the first place and not just for free software sure you can count certificate or license sales for various versions of windows but does anyone even pretend that represents the total number of windows installs
7516335 the best metric to measure the success or failure of an open source project is the number of users moved enough to contribute their vision to the project which enables more people to benefit
7516336 that number not the number of users will measure how much momentum any push for change will get
7516337 it has occurred to me that flash on linux is the one major entry barrier controlling acceptance of linux as a viable desktop operating system
7516338 no matter how stably smoothly efficiently and correctly linux runs on a machine the public will continue to view it as second rate if flash keeps crashing i really do have to suspect adobes motivation for keeping flash on linux in such a deplorable state
7516339 once everybody is using it they dont put any effort into making it work better thats not to say that open source software is always better but at least with open source the more popular your software is the more effort is being put into improving it
7516340 it crashes a lot on windows and linux its annoying on windows and linux the only question i have is why do people still care about flash
7516341 silverlights only chance for survival is adobe screwing flash up and boy do they seem to be going out of their way to do that
7516342 i regret my vote the president did not level with us
7516343 its true in the centre of london and in the big northern cities its linked to the new poverty
7516344 its nothing to do with famine or war quite the opposite england is one of the richest countries in the world
7516345 the people im telling you about have huge tv sets a lot bigger than mine they have state of the art mobile phones cars and they go and get drunk in pubs at the weekend their poverty shows in the way they feed themselves
7516346 i found the cooking of the inhabitants of the slum in soweto in south africa a lot more diverse than ours its true im going to be harsh but i think a lot of english peoples food lacks heart its bland
7516347 its true historically weve never produced wine we have a culture of alcohol and were more beer orientated the only people who drink more than us are the irish and the scottish
7516348 in the past british cuisine was similar to italian cuisine nowadays without the pasta and risotto steam cooking grilled meat herbs spices we used to cook fabulous dishes its all in the past
7516349 unlike french people and i regret it we lost our traditions in gastronomy the world evolves and changes and right in front of us isolated from everything you have france where nothing changes
7516350 its not a judgement its an observation in terms of grand restaurants it seems to me that only one country competes with france and thats japan
7516351 i dont have many but i would like to shoot a tv programme soon
7516352 the french english relationship amuses me as neighbours we criticise each other we mock each other but behind all this we appreciate each other and we respect each other
7516353 id like to watch french women and observe them behind their ovens in their kitchens
7516354 im sure that the rest of the world would love a series on french cuisine directed by an english chef it would be crazy

7516382 if thats what they are planning it will backfire big time i can see random insults moving things from the average person hating vista to the average person hating microsoft no one likes being told theyre an idiot
7516383 the perfect spokesman for windows built on technology developed before the internet well known but not very relevant and even though you really cant avoid windows nobody is fanatical about it
7516384 that really has a synergy with seinfeld you can turn on any broadcast channel in any city in america and be sure theyre playing episodes of seinfeld but nobody is actually a regular viewer of those episodes
7516385 as much as seinfeld was great during its heyday watching it today very clearly dates it and exposes that its not as timeless as theyd like you to believe
7516386 i fear that by drawing on this star of the 90s microsoft may be showing its longing to return to a time when buying a computer meant buying windows
7516387 short of every linux distro calling home which i hope will never happen there may never be a way to know how many linux users there are
7516388 perhaps the downloads of some cross platform application would give a rough idea but that application would have to be something that a linux user a mac user and a windows user would want equally if anyone has a better idea i would love to hear it
7516389 although its difficult to tell how many people are using linux microsoft must have a very good idea of how many people are not using vista
7516390 its a bit though not entirely like trying to calculate the market value of food from a home kitchen compared to that of restaurant meals
7516391 measurement of prices paid is not the only difficult task
7516392 you also have to consider the cost of sampling dont like ubuntu try fedora quickly and free opportunity costs for the software itself a low price now even for what is perceived as lower quality goods in some contexts means money available for other things and freedom to experiment and recombine perhaps windows makes sense for some people in a given organization but the data entry might taste just as good if done on linux based thin terminals
7516393 makes less sense as a concept when the market is as fluid as the free software world
7516394 machines dual boot are repurposed are used as vm hosts or serve apps to dozens of other machines which may or may not be running the same os in the first place and not just for free software sure you can count certificate or license sales for various versions of windows but does anyone even pretend that represents the total number of windows installs
7516395 the best metric to measure the success or failure of an open source project is the number of users moved enough to contribute their vision to the project which enables more people to benefit
7516396 that number not the number of users will measure how much momentum any push for change will get
7516397 it has occurred to me that flash on linux is the one major entry barrier controlling acceptance of linux as a viable desktop operating system
7516398 no matter how stably smoothly efficiently and correctly linux runs on a machine the public will continue to view it as second rate if flash keeps crashing i really do have to suspect adobes motivation for keeping flash on linux in such a deplorable state
7516399 once everybody is using it they dont put any effort into making it work better thats not to say that open source software is always better but at least with open source the more popular your software is the more effort is being put into improving it
7516400 it crashes a lot on windows and linux its annoying on windows and linux the only question i have is why do people still care about flash
7516401 silverlights only chance for survival is adobe screwing flash up and boy do they seem to be going out of their way to do that
7516402 im into that dark shit ive got a 13 hour flight to china and need something good to read
7516403 tell the world that we have risen up against the oppression of the government
7516404 all mankind is from adam and eve an arab has no superiority over a non arab are victims of the first genocide of the 21st century
7516405 arab racism is also so deep it is inscribed in the semantics of the arab language the generic word
7516406 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
7516407 it is the curse of the thinking classes to imagine they can reason even the bloodiest mass murderer into peace
7516408 show me just what mohammed brought that was new and there you will find things only evil and inhuman such as his command to spread by the sword the faith he preached
7516409 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose
7516410 the apes are jews the people of the sabbath while the swine are christians the infidels of the communion of jesus
7516411 fighting infidels until they either convert to islam or submit to muslims as dhimmis is still considered by islamists to be a religious duty
7516412 the militants believe that controlling one country will rally the muslim masses enabling them to overthrow all moderate governments in the region and establish a radical islamic empire that spans from spain to indonesia
7516413 iraq would serve as the base of a new islamic caliphate to extend throughout the middle east and which would threaten
7516414 we are saluting to the spirit of our hero shahid
7516415 we tell them in as much as you love life the muslim loves death and martyrdom palestinians hit a new low setting up a boy unknowingly to become a suicide bomber palestinian children die as human shields for adult terrorist leaders israel tears for palestine child may 21 2006 it was always the case arab muslim leaders have been using abusing their kids as human bombs human shields or as general pawns in their propaganda war to smear israeli defenders
7516416 death is better than living on this earth with the unbelievers among us
7516417 there will be continuing enmity until everyone believes in allah we will not meet the enemy halfway and there will be no room for dialogue with them
7516418 islam does not coincide or make a truce with unbelief but rather confronts it the confrontation that islam calls for with these godless and apostate regimes does not know socratic debates platonic ideals nor aristotelian diplomacy but it knows the dialogue of bullets the ideals of assassination bombing and destruction and the diplomacy of the cannon and machine gun

7516422 the year before with club i sprained my ankle pretty bad so i couldnt work out for a while
7516423 when i came back i decided to go back to the high school team
7516424 i havent really seen much of her floor because shes still in the process of making a floor routine up but shes definitely the one with the highest skill level on the team
7516425 especially in high school with all the homework its a lot
7516426 we practiced on our tramp at home and she helped me
7516427 it takes a lot of talent and a lot of people cant do the things you can do
7516428 it just feels good to do something other people cant
7516429 it definitely makes my job a little bit easier because you dont have to go back and teach them a bunch of basics
7516430 id like to get to state individually instead of just making it as a team
7516431 but i want to make it as a team too

7516433 if we put 2 9 million in there and it turns out to be 3 3 million wed have to give all that additional money back
7516434 we could give a very accurate number if we had those figures
7516435 if youre the second guy to have that heart attack we are going to be able to get you help more quickly than with our current system
7516436 stop the torture stop the war thats what were fighting for
7516437 the whole world is going to be watching and we will march with dignity and discipline today
7516438 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7516439 if students get to know you as a person they like that it helps to build a bond
7516440 the only means a bus driver has to see and support the students behind them is a mirror when they look up and they have to do this while safely transporting the students
7516441 we expect drivers to react to things for which teachers receive constant training and in service days
7516442 after the class we said we need more of this
7516443 we want them to start off on the right foot with the kids and today theyll walk away with some idea on how to do that
7516444 theres been a lot of non violence training and a lot of people dont really want trouble but thats all it takes is one idiot and theyll tar the whole bunch of us
7516445 i wish there was 200 000 people here people would have a sense of whats going on
7516446 if you dont have a place to stay youre stuck
7516447 iraq get out iran stay out bush cheney drive out
7516448 they actually called it that for a little while before they realized their mistake
7516449 its a democratic process we need to have some serious discussions on the issues
7516450 we need to have some serious discussions on the issues
7516451 on a scale of one to 10 it was an eight it touched down and went back up and then touched down again tearing everything up and kicking up dust
7516452 as time goes on having eroding dollars doesnt make sense
7516453 were going to want small class sizes six years from now just as we want small class sizes now
7516454 if we endure a long term decline in the economy the school district will have to do what everyone else is doing which is appropriate
7516455 over time it would be more expensive to keep retrofitting the building rather than build from scratch
7516456 he said he just wanted to prove he could drive a car
7516457 the 14 year old said he saw in the rear view mirror that his friend swerved off the road and hit a house
7516458 so what do u prefer or are u afraid that the 450 and 950 greeks will cause problems and now ur feeling sucere with 40 000 turkish soldiers
7516459 but also whether she would be prepared to accept non eu troops on its soil
7516460 contrary to popular opinion our coaches and our video guys do a great job so we have film on everyone
7516461 we have film on what we think they might do we dont know exactly what theyre going to do when we get on the field we could be wrong
7516462 theres an air of were going to have to learn stuff on the fly theyre going to do some stuff obviously we havent seen before
7516463 like with us no one knows how our spread offense is going to look but us
7516464 different things change from year to year you cant rely on knowing what theyre going to do
7516465 youd rather not have a bunch of guys walking out of the tunnel going whoa this is kind of cool
7516466 we are a young team unfortunately so there are some guys who havent played there before but for the older guys its business as usual
7516467 i dont care if we have to play on mars we still have to strap it on we still have to do what we prepare for attack execute our game plan the way we prepare during the week it doesnt really matter where we play
7516468 he might see who has the longest beard or something

7516470 those first days of a new school year i looked forward to wearing my new school outfit meeting new friends and new teachers but the most meaningful and surely the most memorable moments were when i hurried to the breakfast table to see what my father had written to me that morning i keep these letters in a special binder and read them every year about this time i have since passed this tradition on to my own children the words are different as i have all boys but the love pride and well wishes for the coming year are the same tonight i have placed three letters by three cereal bowls at our breakfast table

7516476 i dont have issues with advertising but with your ability to turn it off

7516482 the timeline is important but what is more important is the content and the nature of the understanding we can reach with the palestinians
7516483 i think that when the israelis and the palestinians can agree on something the international community should respect it
7516484 we asked the americans not to put forth bridging proposals shortcuts and no partial agreements

7516524 on august 5 prior to the beijing games pastor romero had transformed two hotel rooms creating effigies of blood spattered torture victims and painting human rights slogans such as our world our nightmare the protest took place just days before president bush issued his strong condemnation of abuse of religious freedom in china after the protest pastor romero went into hiding and has been living in the open with the protection of a small shelter existing on rations he bought before leaving beijing
7516525 pastor eddie romero is a much loved church leader professor and family man whose actions are driven by deepest concern for the abused in china he took this exceptional step in order to draw much needed attention to the plight of those suffering persecution for their faith and other beliefs
7516526 while csw does not condone civil disobedience we strongly endorse the validity of the calls he is making for china to ratify the iccpr and to release the named prisoners his courage in handing himself over to the chinese authorities shows the depths with which he identifies with the suffering of the chinese people
7516527 teaching religious beliefs without specialised religious education and without permission from the central organ of a registered religious organisation as well as teaching religious beliefs privately
7516528 those organisations are probably not in collecting in a timely manner the necessary documents for registration or are violating something
7516529 we have collected documents and are trying to register again with the nukus justice department
7516530 the vietnamese soldiers seem to have been given a mission to shoot to kill anyone they want in the central highlands just as it was when vietnam was at war with america many years ago

7516551 let the court case finish and only then we will talk to you about this
7516552 they will not do it because they are only interested in expropriating the religious organisations property
7516553 we were told by the authorities that they would give it back to the kindergarten
7516554 but no one including the kindergarten has done anything on the land
7516555 there is no building on that land it is an empty plot
7516556 it looks like they are trying to close down our church with any excuse

7516564 i sincerely hope that no one you know or love is killed by a drunk driver you might then change your mind about whether prevention is better than punishment
7516565 your opinion matches every other drunk ive known in that you think that you are able to handle yourself behind the wheel
7516566 we have laws in this country governing driving like stop signs if you break the law by driving through a stop sign you get a ticket the same is and ought to be true of drunk drivers they break the law and should be punished for it

7516796 la polic a sabe que amy es drogadicta y acaba de ser captada dos veces tomando sustancias ilegales por lo que deber an arrestarla y ponerla entre rejas
7516797 at the establishment of our constitutions the judiciary bodies were supposed to be the most helpless and harmless members of the government experience however soon showed in what way they were to become the most dangerous that the insufficiency of the means provided for their removal gave them a freehold and irresponsibility in office that their decisions seeming to concern individual suitors only pass silent and unheeded by the public at large that these decisions nevertheless become law by precedent sapping by little and little the foundations of the constitution and working its change by construction before any one has perceived that that invisible and helpless worm has been busily employed in consuming its substance in truth man is not made to be trusted for life if secured against all liability to account
7516798 he provided cover to other democrats to do what the credit industry was urging them to do
7516799 the floor started coming up as i clung to the rim and before i knew it the wall starting falling
7516800 it felt like the entire room was going to capsize like the poseiden adventure
7516801 this morning security forces surrounded kalma camp and demanded that every idp internally displaced person leave
7516802 later they opened fire on the eastern side of the camp there were many casualties up to now we have 27 confirmed dead and 75 wounded
7516803 i know from ngos working inside kalma that there is fighting inside the camp but they didnt give me details
7516804 unamid military have dispatched a patrol to see the situation and maybe make a safe corridor for the casualties
7516805 if you have a sample from a brother or a father it is easy but if we get away from this and have to turn to more distant relatives things are much much more complicated
7516806 will some bodies go unidentified i cannot tell you right now but it is a possibility
7516807 sen clinton and her campaign have been wonderful partners in working on this convention with us
7516808 there may be people on the periphery of both operations who believe that for whatever reason this is a storyline they want to promote but this is not the case with the people who actually matter which is sen clinton and sen obama
7516809 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7516810 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7516811 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7516812 degrade and burn up on rentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
7516813 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7516814 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa believes that it will be able to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for
7516815 as long as russia can be said to be abiding by the terms of the cease fire in georgia
7516816 there is an issue but i dont think its so strong to prevent the waiver from passing as long as russian behavior is what it has been agreed to on georgia
7516817 compromiso de la empresa de comunicar los cambios con antelaci n
7516818 they ppp have unilaterally ended the basis of the coalition
7516819 nawaz sharif will announce the future course of action at 6 00 pm 1200 gmt after holding consultations with the party
7516820 it is our desire that the coalition remains intact because the masses are looking towards us for solving the problems of poverty price hikes unemployment and terrorism
7516821 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7516822 its clearly a strategy to eliminate our members and reverse our majority in parliament
7516823 we have been informed they want to arrest 15 mps its all about the vote for the speaker nothing to do with the law
7516824 this arrogance has the potential of sinking the ship of our negotiations we dont need arrogance on the part of any of the parties we need maturity and harmony and not acrimony
7516825 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7516826 the race card has become molefes most abiding if not his only contribution to corporate governance in sa and it always makes for great headlines
7516827 her writing is mature and her lyrics flow in an almost conversational manner which is wholly engaging
7516828 another new talent from canada is about to take the music world by storm
7516829 like an old friend checking in after a long absence theres a rolling open road accessibility to lynne hansons music that i find very old school and refreshing
7516830 shot through with chances missed and if only tunes this debut album by ottawas lynne hanson makes for fine listening
7516831 at that moment there was no regulatory framework but with the approval of the insurance act by parliament in june we were able to come back into the rwandan market
7516832 we continued servicing our clients despite having suspended our operations in rwanda we were the ones running bcrs clinic
7516833 we are in the process of setting up offices in burundi but we plan on having our headquarters in kigali
7516834 we expect kigali to be the hub of the great lakes region as we are also looking at possibilities to tap into the eastern part of the democratic republic of congo
7516835 protecting and allowing them to move freely though the bakassi issue was hot
7516836 if the reactions are good we will come back next year
7516837 when i was coming to rwanda at first i did not know where i would be working
7516838 i did not want to work in kigali because i wanted to go outside of the cities to have the real feel and see what it takes and means to be in rural areas so when they told me that i was going to rwamagana i was happy because i was going to see and have a new experience in life
7516839 rwanda being a french speaking country i thought that it was going to be hard for me but surprisingly enough my whole class was perfect they all knew english though at first we had someone who helped us to introduce the subject that we were going to deal with in the two weeks
7516840 most of the teachers really liked us actually they are asking us to stay longer but we were given only two weeks and hopefully we shall come back next year
7516841 we have learnt a lot of skills we have learnt how to make pupils propose subjects for class
7516842 at the end of the day we have done a lot of things planning introducing topics and the pupils are passive and end up getting nothing
7516843 but during these two weeks we have been taught how to involve pupils in lesson plans this kind of system i believe will benefit the pupils since they are will be more involved
7516844 now that they will be involved even the weaker pupils will have the chance to express themselves so the situation of only a few pupils participating in class is going to stop and i will have a very active class
7516845 president mwanawasas health has always been a problem even before he started his presidential mandate
7516846 the effects of what we eat and do on our health in the future
7516847 met zijn 7 2 ton gewicht en als enige man in de kudde wordt er niet aan zijn gezag getwijfeld
7516848 dan brommen ze bijvoorbeeld iets wat over grote afstand is te horen en bedoelen ze ik eet hier het is hier goed
7516849 zo stormde de hele kudde af op de luidspreker waaruit geluid van olifanten uit berlijn kwam
7516850 we zijn benieuwd hoe deze dieren reageren op geluiden van hun vroegere bekenden
7516851 als de voordelen van een wto lidmaatschap al bestaan dan zien of voelen we ze niet
7516852 i was running a company that was plundering the earth
7516853 at stonyfield we have factored the planet into all our decisions
7516854 there is only one ppc party recognized by the law
7516855 when he left mr marara did not take the entire party with him
7516856 you can check it the high court he has lost the case
7516857 a recognized political party should not be taken as a personal entity those are people who are trying to survive in dubious ways
7516858 i wouldnt be surprised that they engage in such activities because it has been their intention since last year after the party elections
7516859 we are yet to see what will happen during the campaign and the elections which we will analyze when the process is completed
7516860 i did not have money for instruments at that time so i used to mime and did some a cappella with a few friends in a group called boyz ii men
7516861 but since we used to mime their songs our fans decided to nickname us after them
7516862 you could say i was born with a microphone my dream has always been to have a hell of a voice moreover for me singing is the only way to get my message across to the people
7516863 we want to preach to the people about what happened in the genocide and to tell them that it should never happen again which is why we call the tour never again
7516864 we have not come to make money or for our own interest whatever revenue we get from the concerts we will give to orphanages
7516865 we expected to have a big crowd but unfortunately few people turned up so we cancelled the show
7516866 you shouldnt compare the music scene in rwanda with the region
7516867 the country is still healing from the genocide so you should give it time to catch up with others music needs time to develop look at a star like acon he is real big these days but he began his career a long time ago so give rwanda some time and i think everything will be fine
7516868 artists should communicate with each other and have good relationship with other prominent artists in the region
7516869 when you are looking for something you should always avoid being selfish and instead open up for others and also be ready to learn from them
7516870 we can perform alongside them and even invite them to come to europe so that these artists will become better known and get promotion
7516871 some music and sounds are difficult to play on stage unless you have the software much depends on the type of music you are playing
7516872 the easiest music to play live is jazz and reggae other genres are always difficult
7516873 it is high time that we develop our own style i think by having a rwandan style much more people will be interested to attend our concerts because it will be much easier to get the message across
7516874 now concerts often attract only small crowds because its just about staging a show and most of the people dont want the western thing yet thats what most artists do people in this country love their culture so they are eager to live it through music
7516875 but as i grew up i fell in love with nass one of the prominent us rap musicians
7516876 we aim at being the catalysts of rwandas tourism industry in line with the governments vision
7516877 the continued investment of serena hotels mirrors the success story of development and opportunity in africa
7516878 todays discerning travelers are looking for an all inclusive experience whether they need an executive conference off site meeting or luxury accommodation we want to make them feel at home
7516879 the family planning story in rwanda is one of gain and loss followed by rebuilding to regain lost ground and then achieving even greater progress
7516880 a traditional wedding toast encourages newly married couples be fruitful may you have many sons and daughters
7516881 the government was shy to talk about family planning because so many families had lost loved ones
7516882 when asked about the main keys to success most people talked first about the political will behind family planning
7516883 family planning is priority number one not just talking about it but implementing it
7516884 people have a high propensity to listen to authority there is a high level of obeying what the government says
7516885 the biggest challenge now is harmonizing and having national coverage because we are not going at the same pace
7516886 coordination has ensured that all districts are receiving assistance in strengthening family planning service delivery and has led to standardized training and iec tools information education and communication
7516887 while there are various mechanisms for coordination and a number of policies in place there is a lack of a strong central focal point for family planning within the government to ensure coordination and effectively share lessons and identify gaps
7516888 there have been a number of innovative methods of providing motivation and incentives for performance including performance based financing performance based contracts and district incentive funds
7516889 motivation produces results but it can be expensive these projects should include exploration of how to transition to more sustainable systems of motivation over time
7516890 this is a pilot phase for the fund in which we have set aside frw 150 million from riepas annual budget
7516891 if the fund is utilized we expect that the government will allocate rwacef its own budget
7516892 this fund targets companies that are already in the export business and which are faced with certain constraints
7516893 flowers are perishable and need rapid transportation but transport costs are making it very difficult to stay in business
7516894 transport subsidies would mitigate the constraints we are currently facing
7516895 theyve surpassed us because their government has given them subsidies
7516896 when the program was conceived subsidies were no part of it so we will have to sit down with exporters and discuss the issue to see how they can best be assisted
7516897 exporters will get a lot of support from rwacef but it would be a lie to say that it will cover transport subsidies we may at a certain moment do that but not in the short term
7516898 i felt bad it was tough but we were aiming to finish second and i did it
7516899 it was not easy for lewis but he did the job
7516900 again we suffered with a reliability problem this time on kimis car which lost us precious points
7516901 now we have to find out what happened in yet another engine failure and then decide how to react
7516902 clearly what happened is serious and we will have to do all in our power to make up for the ground we have lost through reliability problems in the coming races
7516903 the most positive element for us was that the boxes containing our spare parts were kept closed all weekend
7516904 we didnt need to fit a single replacement part throughout a race weekend that everyone thought would be full of crashes
7516905 now we can work hard for the final third of the season which begins with the back to back races at spa and monza two particularly challenging circuits that will put maximum stress on the engines
7516906 the national economy is experiencing two external shocks related to the global rise in food and petrol prices
7516907 the green revolution program has helped a lot in increasing food production
7516908 we have witnessed cross border trade with rwandan food being sold especially maize and beans
7516909 it may look as a short time fix to the situation but in the long run it would affect the economy
7516910 i would not dignify this tokenism by organising anything there it will have to be at a proper place like here at raffles place or down a major street or nothing
7516911 its definitely a positive step it is a good step in finally opening up our society that little bit it gives us a chance to raise pertinent issues in our society out in the public area
7516912 didnt know it was so hard shopping for hot dog buns
7516913 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful
7516914 mounting bombing raids and widespread detentions of afghans are rapidly turning afghanistan into the mirror image of iraq but these very real events which will have devastating consequences over the next few months and years are largely ignored by us
7516915 best western took immediate action to disable the compromised log in account in question we are currently in the process of working with our credit card partners to ensure that all relevant procedural standards are met and that the interests of our guests are protected
7516916 we continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information
7516917 large consequences for peace and security in europe and beyond
7516918 we were concentrating more on the flight than the record
7516919 die beziehungen komplett aufk ndigen w rde so h tte das f r russland keine schlimmen auswirkungen
7516920 i am your deliverer trust in me absolutely know that i will do the very best for you be ready and willing for my will to be done
7516921 all things are possible with my master my lord my friend
7516922 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever again live in one state with georgia
7516923 its reasonable to discuss already today the transdniestr problem i see good chances for solving it
7516924 how dangerous such so called frozen conflicts can be given that the georgian leadership as they say went crazy
7516925 this is a serious warning for us all it is in this context that we should view the question of transdniestr resolution
7516926 hay alguien ah que quiera hablar que vaya al s
7516927 respecto a esto estoy totalmente en contra y doy fe por experimentaciones propias que realmente las voces y los contactos oui ja vienen de los seres fallecidos
7516928 la tabla ouija no es un juguete es un instrumento para la actividad de medium las tablas ouija han sido usadas durante siglos en las culturas orientales para comunicarse con los esp ritus y para adivinar informaci n
7516929 francamente parker brothers no sabe esta es una industria l der en la fabricaci n de juegos pero duda si la ouija la tabla que habla debe realmente ser considerada como un juego lo que s saben es que muchos se divierten bastante con ella y que quienes disfrutan us ndola est n frecuentemente interesados en el ocultismo
7516930 las tablas guija son tan peligrosas como las drogas no se debe jugar con ellas recuerde las sesiones espiritistas las tablas ouija y otros objetos del ocultismo son peligrosos porque con frecuencia los malos esp ritus se disfrazan como seres queridos y toman posesi n de sus vidas
7516931 la ouija el juego de ni os que deletrea peligro
7516932 ministerio de salubridad para que investigara los efectos mentales negativos del juego antes de que alguien resultara perjudicado
7516933 para el bien de los ni os y adolescentes de todas partes esto debe hacerse ahora
7516934 si usted no invitar a al archienemigo de dios y del hombre a que habitara ntimamente con usted tampoco piense tener una tabla ouija en su hogar
7516935 y cuando os digan preguntad a los encantadores y a los adivinos que susurran y bisbisean responded no consultar el pueblo a su dios
7516936 y si alguno de vosotros tiene falta de sabidur a que la pida a dios el cual da a todos abundantemente y sin reproche y le ser dada
7516937 cuando hayas entrado en la tierra que yav tu dios te da no imites las costumbres perversas de aquellos pueblos que no haya en medio de ti nadie que haga pasar a su hijo o a su hija por el fuego que nadie practique el encantamiento o consulte a los astros que no haya brujos ni hechiceros que no se halle a nadie que se dedique a supersticiones o consulte los esp ritus que no se halle ning n adivino o quien pregunte a los muertos porque yav aborrece a los que se dedican a todo esto y los expulsa delante de ti a causa de estas abominaciones
7516938 oh sacerdote de cristo sabes que soy un demonio por qu me molestas

7516965 tudo depende das prioridades da otan se a prioridade o apoio ao regime de mikhail saakashvili em preju zo da associa o com a r ssia isso n o culpa nossa
7516966 tentar transformar o agressor em v tima justificar o regime criminoso salvar um regime que est afundando e apostar no rearmamento
7516967 the feeling were getting is that its progressing of course its not guaranteed
7516968 the idea that consolidation in the sector is over is not true theres more action to come
7516969 santander is interested in the business of consumer finance which we are involved in germany already
7516970 we have a business model that is growing and its profitable
7516971 the allianz share price is falling because of dresdner and they would like to sell sooner rather than later and potential buyers see that
7516972 there are several banks for sale here and that pushes the price down im not so sure a deal will be possible in the next few months
7516973 non ho mai detto che gli insegnanti del sud abbassano la qualit della scuola italiana unidiozia esistono docenti bravi in lombardia e in sicilia io mi riferivo alle scuole non agli insegnanti sono due cose diverse
7516974 the flood victims will need at least two months of relief support
7516975 with the increasing threats on human life our staff are on high alert to help the affected families
7516976 contingency plans and relief supply stocks are in place and there is a need to improve field level coordination among key stakeholders to help the affected families
7516977 at least i believe its reasonable to expect that a lot of our pass game as similar terminology and route structure to what we used when we coached michael in toronto some of our run terminologys a little but different but some of it is very similar to when we first coached michael in 2002 he has much more of an opportunity to be up to speed than for someone to come in that we dont know
7516978 he can be a tremendous team guy and he really can be a real positive leader on the field and off the field and to be perfectly honest his role in toronto has been inconsistent and he really hasnt had an opportunity to show a consistent good side
7516979 i dont him bishop so i cant say that i dont want him around
7516980 we were 6 0 with the guys we have just no comment i mean that just shows you how it can get you just have to take it one day at a time its a sad day around here its the harsh reality of the game we play and its just a sad day
7516981 i hope the players are always trying to show off in terms of doing the right thing and being the best they can be i told them already im the new guy in here so its a clean slate im looking forward to seeing what they can do maybe for some guys thats a good thing and maybe for some guys it isnt good its wide open and im looking forward to seeing guys perform and impress all of us the coaching staff and the management
7516982 we will not rest until the prisoners are freed and the jails are empty
7516983 we had lost hope that my brother would be released because hes been in prison for 32 years
7516984 its not easy for israel to release prisoners some of the individuals being released today are guilty of direct involvement in the murder of innocent civilians
7516985 we believe this action can support the negotiation process and create goodwill
7516986 this is something that matters a lot to the palestinians it matters a lot to the palestinian people and it is obviously a sign of good will
7516987 when mohammed was arrested i was 22 years old my children were babies
7516988 russias historic role of the guarantor of piece in the caucasus has increased
7516989 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7516990 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state

7517073 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7517074 let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you in the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of party generally
7517075 barack obama represents the merger of two of the worst aspects of democratic politics 60s radicalism and corrupt chicago machine politics with the addition of slow joe biden to the ticket obama has added to his unsteady candidacy an epic amount of beltway cluelessness and arrogance unsupported by anything except frequent flier miles and delawares love for a chuckle headed fellow with a big smile i was worried that the dems had pointed out to obama that his serial gaffing had brought the campaign close to a break point and that he needed hillary i was worried hed actually go find anthony zinni or sam nunn or someone of accomplishment and purposefulness in foreign affairs jim webb would have been hell on the stump tim kaine or evan bayh would have put different states into play kathleen sebelius was a wild card but biden put bidens obvious flaws aside and ask yourself how in the world obama decided to go with biden and youll quickly realize that the democratic nominee must have been impressed with biden on the long campaign trail of 2007 and 2008 even though voters werent and even though biden has no accomplishments of note after 36 years in the senate biden talked a great game and dropped some very interesting place names and this impressed obama talking the talk has been the key to obamas success and in slow joe he found an older far better traveled but equally prolix gas bag for obama it is all about politics and words elections and poses slow joe is the perfect running mate on a perfect ticket for a party betting on wind to solve the energy crisis
7517076 there are two other issues with which mr obama must grapple and far from helping with any of these mr biden actually makes mr obamas path more difficult the first is that mr obamas other big challenge is convincing moderate americans he shares their values he is already seen by many as a liberal big city politician who says people cling to guns and religion out of bitterness associates with radicals and attended a church with a radical theology mr biden is a fierce foe of gun rights ardently opposes restrictions on abortion that have widespread support and promotes gay rights he supports higher taxes bigger government and socialized healthcare that doesnt exactly help mr obama with blue collar voters in ohio pennsylvania and michigan the second is mr bidens lack of executive experience not only has he never been a governor or a cabinet secretary he has never been a mayor an agency head or served in any other executive role not even prosecutor or military officer given that mr obama also lacks that experience having two career legislators heading the executive branch of our government might create doubts more broadly it cuts against mr obamas central campaign theme of change his message is washington is broken and the old establishment needs to be swept away in favor of new blood and a new vision how does picking someone who has been in washington a decade longer than mr mccain jive with mr obamas contention that mr mccain has been in washington too long to change it
7517077 alas the abandonment of babies to suffer and die on the modern equivalent of a spartan cliff did not require confronting evil when obama saw it indeed obama turned a blind eye leading the battle to defeat illinois version of the federal born alive infants protection act which would have treated babies living albeit briefly outside the womb as well babies he opposed the bill in 2003 as he had a similar one in 2001 saying it would undermine roe v wade but even after roe neutral language was included wording good enough that it won support for the federal version of the bill from abortion rights stalwart sen barbara boxer obama remained unmoved until this week obama denied that he ever took such a position his campaign now admits that he was in effect lying when he said pro lifers were lying about his record but simultaneously obama defends a position that comes dismayingly close to the laymans understanding of infanticide while claiming any other position would require him to play god
7517078 instead of pointing to the success of the thousands of black americans who have worked to achieve their own american dreams and using his campaign victory as the presumptive democratic candidate for president as a sign of what americans of any race can do he continues to play to the victim thinking mentality its that same thinking that has kept far too many black americans enslaved to affirmative action and its premise that they cant succeed without it the black harvard sociologist orlando patterson is quoted in larry elders the ten things you cant say in america the sociological truths are that america while still flawed in its race relations is now the least racist white majority society in the world has a better record of legal protection of minorities than any other society white or black offers more opportunities to a greater number of black persons than any other society including all those of africa voting for or against someone because of the color of his skin is a form of racism that should be un american the first black president of the united states should earn it the old fashioned way by combining experience leadership acumen with compelling policy priorities that excite the electorate barack obamas lack of proven leadership experience his inconsistent policy stands and non existent legislative track record leaves much to be desired as a president

7517181 you dont want the president saying one day everyone drive on the right and the next day everyone drive on the left
7517182 if we stay we risk building resentment against the u s if we go we risk iraqi security
7517183 this might incur both risks since it makes iraqis think we are an arbitrary occupier and it makes terrorists think we could be persuaded to leave under pressure
7517184 in other words either coordinated outcome stay or go is better than the uncoordinated one maybe well stay maybe well go
7517185 if the facts change or if situations change then a legitimate public official or a policy analyst or a citizen voting for a candidate would want to know that
7517186 if a situation has changed maybe its a good thing that the opinions have changed
7517187 voters would like to think that their elected officials are being honest
7517188 but i think most voters understand that elected officials have a legitimate reason to want to change their views on issues in a world thats constantly changing and in a political system where in order to get things done you have to sometimes compromise

7517202 tell the world that we have risen up against the oppression of the government
7517203 its expensive and a little difficult to manage but we still think theres good value for the right film at venice
7517204 we took sleuth there last year and it performed incredibly well in italy france and spain and i think the venice launch had a lot to do with that theres nothing like a red carpet event in venice if youve got the right stars but if you dont it can be difficult
7517205 venice doesnt even help much to launch our films in italy let alone anywhere else
7517206 our italian distributor bim was willing to have the film in rome over venice mainly for timing issues better time to release the film in october in italy and secondarily for costs consideration
7517207 thats a factor for a lot of distributors and sales companies acquisitions people go more to toronto where there are more sidebars and product what you manage to accomplish at cannes and to a lesser extent at venice is a great junket but in venice the hotels are obscenely expensive and not very good it costs a fortune to rent interview space and the service is appalling then youve got the cost of boats because all the really big stars want to stay at the cipriani
7517208 the last couple of weeks for me were really exhausting because i had to travel all around the world
7517209 everything in 10 days you can imagine how i feel
7517210 its just a matter of being tired maybe a little run down
7517211 at the moment i think all our players were in the mode of lets just try to get through the u s open and see how we feel afterward so even if youre tired you dont allow it to come out
7517212 by the time its like 7 or 8 in the evening i cant keep my eyes open so im having a hard time
7517213 im trying to adjust especially if i play some night matches here its very important for me to be ready for that
7517214 it really helps my confidence to come into a tournament and feel like theres no one that youre scared of
7517215 you feel like you can beat every single person in the tournament
7517216 youve got a blockbuster night kicking off two weeks of the toughest tennis in the world and more importantly what will be the finest gathering of tennis champions ever assembled in one place
7517217 history is a big part of this game and were trying to marry tradition with innovation at the open
7517218 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7517219 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7517220 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7517221 i would have been dead if president mwanawasa did not personally intervene to ensure my evacuation to south africa for specialist treatment
7517222 this is all to protect poor muslims from rich christians who buy their organs and vice versa
7517223 if some copts are angered by the law then why is it that muslims are not
7517224 it is degrading for both religions if lets say a poor christian has to sell his kidney to a rich muslim or a poor muslim has to sell his kidney to a rich christian it is not right for either religion and that is why we made this law so we can stop organ trafficking
7517225 it is not about trying to promote differences between religions but its just to minimize the trade of organs as much as we can
7517226 we all have the same egyptian blood but if the reason for the measure is to end organ trafficking we reject it because it may also occur between believers of the same religion
7517227 we are afraid that in the future there will be hospitals for christians and hospitals for muslims
7517228 could lead to discrimination between a muslim and a christian living in the same country
7517229 is discriminatory since it violates human rights the constitution and national unity
7517230 if organ donations are from the third or fourth degree of the family then there is less of a chance of a trade happening as its not likely that family members will sell organs to each other
7517231 no one really comes up and says they want to donate their organs to other people who are not in their family this happens in the west but in egypt it is mostly the poor people who are desperate and end up selling their organs for money
7517232 we applaud the courage of the secretary general and his expression of moral authority we expect the secretary general to also stand for the rights of the people of burma who were unable to express their real aspirations in the referendum
7517233 at the very least we dont want the united nations siding with the dictators and forcing the people of burma into an untenable position
7517234 pakistan today is the most dangerous place in the world pakistan faces the threat of both talibanisation and balkanisation which are gaining in strength
7517235 dont hesitate to rape a christian girl even if she dies no one will get us her poor parents cannot pursue us
7517236 within minutes the christian residential area was blazing christian residents fled to save their lives
7517237 you are free you are free to go to your temples you are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in this state of pakistan you may belong to any religion caste or creed that has nothing to do with the business of the state we are starting with this fundamental principle that we are all citizens and citizens of one state

7517271 barack obama has re opened a wound among american catholics by picking a pro abortion catholic politician
7517272 the american bishops have made clear that catholic political leaders must defend the dignity of every human person including the unborn sadly joe bidens tenure in the united states senate has been marked by steadfast support for legal abortion
7517273 now everywhere biden campaigns well have this question of whether a pro abortion catholic can receive communion
7517274 senator biden is an unrepentant supporter of abortion in direct opposition to the church he claims as his own selecting a pro abortion catholic is a slap in the face to catholic voters
7517275 no one today would accept this statement from any public servant i am personally opposed to human slavery and racism but will not impose my personal conviction in the legislative arena
7517276 the promotion of abortion by any catholic is a grave and serious matter objectively according to the constant teaching of the scriptures and the church it would be more spiritually beneficial for such a person to refrain from receiving the body and blood of christ i ask catholics in this position to have the integrity to respect the eucharist catholic teaching and the catholic faithful

7517351 lo que se pretende con estas actuaciones es persuadir a los ciudadanos de que determinadas actividades est n prohibidas porque comportan un elevado riesgo de provocar un incendio sin quererlo
7517352 no se act a nicamente en el caso de que se produzca un incendio forestal ya que es muy importante actuar antes de que el incendio llegue a producirse
7517353 en la mayor parte de los casos se inicia un procedimiento sancionador cuando se producen hechos que sin llegar a ser causa de un incendio forestal suponen un incumplimiento claro de la normativa de prevenci n de incendios forestales
7517354 especialmente la realizaci n de fuego en terrenos forestales o en una franja de seguridad de 500 metros del monte sin autorizaci n o incumpliendo las condiciones de seguridad recogidas en la misma
7517355 del total de estos expedientes el grupo m s importante de las infracciones cometidas con un 27 por ciento del total son debidas al incumplimiento de la normativa reguladora sobre realizaci n de quemas de restos agr colas o forestales la mayor a de ellos en la provincia de castell n

7517423 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7517424 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7517425 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7517426 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7517427 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7517428 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7517429 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7517430 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible
7517431 this is not unlike the type of risk that one experiences from

7517472 if the muslim community should be angry with anyone shouldnt it be with barack obama for being ashamed of islam and for denying his roots
7517473 at the core of that denial is either shame or deception
7517474 and we should not be labeled as islamophobes or racists for demanding to know the truth about a man who wants to become president of the united states
7517475 were not saying theres a problem with his islamic background
7517476 in a strange twist of irony that seems to be what mr obama is doing all by himself and muslims all around the world should be outraged that he is denying his past instead much of the islamic world seems to love him does that make any sense
7517477 mr brown 47 a 6 foot 6 bear of a man is perhaps best known for his involvement with the willie horton television advertisement that helped sink michael s dukakiss candidacy in 1988
7517478 mr brown has had much in his career to be delighted about as the source of scores of conservative assaults on democrats that have earned him their lasting enmity
7517479 that created the muslim terrorists who are now waging jihad on the industrialized world
7517480 its strange to acknowledge that calling someone a muslim is a smear
7517481 speak out forcefully against the anti muslim bigotry at the core of this smear
7517482 raised the issue of islamophobia and allows it to be acknowledged and openly discussed
7517483 when the crews dropped him off he was in a stable but critical condition

7517498 im delighted everyone enjoyed it but im miserable we were like two olympic boxers out there flailing arms and everything but not terribly good when it came to defending
7517499 i would like to think we are a bit more professional defensively than that but perhaps it is a wake up call for us
7517500 we lost one early on against leicester last season so hopefully this will set us up for our next few games
7517501 i thought we invited forest onto us and they kept the ball better than we did scoring some very good goals we might have had a penalty late on but ive never made excuses and im not going to start now
7517502 thats the championship to be honest if youre not 100 on your game then you get punished
7517503 i dont think strikers are going to be our problem we scored 106 goals last season 100 the year before we will be fine
7517504 there is no knee jerk reactions on our part on not taking enough chances because these boys have earned the right to have a go in the premier league
7517505 wed like to sign another striker if we possibly can but if we cant then we wont
7517506 we will not be selling any of our players for less than the amount that we believe they are worth if anyone wants albert riera then they will have to pay what espanyol wants

7517525 essentially you have a sea of plants monocultures for tens of kilometers in what sense can that ever be sustainable
7517526 i am extremely wary of well meaning people who like to feel good about themselves contributing in a terrible way to the destruction of our planet
7517527 the good news is that youre starting to see people all over the world starting to talk about these issues
7517528 people are much more amenable to following these standards and adopting them
7517529 they see it as a very typical developed country attempt to keep developing countries from profiting off a commodity

7517547 for more than a century ichthyologists have thought that pacific and atlantic goliath grouper were the same species and the argument was settled before the widespread use of genetic techniques the genetic data were the key to our finding two species one on each side of the isthmus
7517548 in light of our new findings the pacific goliath grouper should be treated with separate management and conservation strategies
7517549 when a man receives hormone therapy initially the treatment works well and his psa prostate specific antigen level goes down
7517550 but inevitably the psa will start climbing again and that is usually the first sign that the treatment is beginning to fail its a sign that the cancer in the prostate is making a comeback
7517551 the androgen receptor acts differently in different cells in prostate tissue
7517552 its always been assumed that blocking the androgen receptor will stop all prostate cells from growing but we have found that thats not the case since current treatment acts non specifically on all the cells having androgen receptors in the prostate blocking the androgen receptor will give mixed results
7517553 while the androgen receptor is really driving prostate cancer in another sense it appears that the receptor also normally inhibits the spread of cancer cells it seems to have a dual role manipulating the androgen receptor can increase or decrease either of these actions depending on precisely how its done
7517554 the effects of the androgen receptor on hair growth in men vary dramatically depending on where in the body the receptor is working
7517555 when the receptor is very active in the mustache area more hair grows when its very active on the top of the skull toward the front hair falls out and men become bald and the hair on the back of the head is insensitive to the receptor the effects of hormones depend on the location
7517556 we found that the same is true within the cells of the prostate itself

7517563 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008

7517588 a pentagon audit of 8 2 billion in american taxpayer money spent by the united states army on contractors in iraq has found that almost none of the payments followed federal rules and that in some cases contracts worth millions of dollars were paid for despite little or no record of what if anything was received the audit also found a sometimes stunning lack of accountability in the way the united states military spent some 1 8 billion in seized or frozen iraqi assets which in the early phases of the conflict were often doled out in stacks or pallets of cash
7517589 main street may be struggling but wall street is on a bit of a roll despite a drumbeat of bad economic news the stock market is up almost 11 percent in the last few weeks junk bonds those risky corporate i o u s are rallying the value of financial shares bank loans tricky credit derivatives up up up many on wall street the epicenter of the credit mess seem to think that the worst is over for the first time in months analysts and executives sound upbeat again many of them see a broad sustained recovery in both the economy and the financial markets coming in the second half of this year a prediction some market strategists call hopeful at best
7517590 thousands of farmers are taking their fields out of the governments biggest conservation program which pays them not to cultivate they are spurning guaranteed annual payments for a chance to cash in on the boom in wheat soybeans corn and other crops last fall they took back as many acres as are in rhode island and delaware combined environmental and hunting groups are warning that years of progress could soon be lost particularly with the native prairie in the upper midwest but a broad coalition of baking poultry snack food ethanol and livestock groups say bigger harvests are a more important priority than habitats for waterfowl and other wildlife they want the government to ease restrictions on the preserved land which would encourage many more farmers to think beyond conservation
7517591 this search for cash comes as national party committees like the d n c are barred from soliciting or spending soft money the unrestricted donations to political parties but there is one major exception to these limits the unlimited contributions from corporations and unions for the partys convention even more donations for the conventions unlike other campaign contributions are fully tax deductible to corporations as a business expense to many critics this is the last soft money loophole in campaign finance one that neither mr obama nor his republican rival senator john mccain who was a sponsor of the legislation banning soft money has spoken out against and the convention fund raising could test the commitment these two candidates have to erasing the influence of big money in politics
7517592 a majority of nearly every demographic and political group democrats and republicans men and women residents of cities and rural areas college graduates and those who finished only high school say the united states is headed in the wrong direction seventy eight percent of respondents said the country was worse off than five years ago just 4 percent said it was better off the dissatisfaction is especially striking because public opinion usually hits its low point only in the months and years after an economic downturn not at the beginning of one today however americans report being deeply worried about the country even though many say their own personal finances are still in fairly good shape
7517593 the record storms and floods that swept through the midwest last month struck at the heart of americas corn region drowning fields and dashing hopes of a bumper crop they also brought into sharp relief a new economic hazard as america grows more reliant on corn for its fuel supply it is becoming vulnerable to the many hazards that can damage crops ranging from droughts to plagues to storms the floods have helped send the price of ethanol up 19 percent in a month they appear to have had little effect on the price of gasoline at the pump as ethanol represents only about 6 percent of the nations transport fuel today
7517594 last fall blackwater worldwide was in deep peril guards for the security company were involved in a shooting in september that left at least 17 iraqis dead at a baghdad intersection outrage over the killings prompted the iraqi government to demand blackwaters ouster from the country and led to a criminal investigation by the f b i a series of internal investigations by the state department and the pentagon and high profile congressional hearings but after an intense public and private lobbying campaign blackwater appears to be back to business as usual
7517595 im pretty sure that the new president whoever it is will not show up and work on george bushs domestic achievement on day 1 she told a group of civic leaders and educators promising to do everything in my power to improve the law before the white house changes hands for ms spellings a longtime and exceedingly loyal member of the bush inner circle it was a startling if tacit admission that the presidents education legacy is in danger no child left behind the signature domestic achievement beyond tax cuts of the entire bush presidency has changed the lives of millions of american students parents teachers and school administrators yet its future is in grave doubt adopted by congress on a wave of bipartisan unity that followed the terrorist attacks of sept 11 2001 the law imposed unprecedented testing requirements and tough expectations on the nations nearly 99 000 public schools but despite rising test scores there is no hard and fast evidence most experts say that it is actually improving student achievement

7517598 such massive galaxy clusters are thought to be rare objects in the distant universe
7517599 they can be used to test cosmological theories indeed the very presence of this cluster confirms the existence of a mysterious component of the universe called dark energy
7517600 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7517601 according to the current cosmological theories we should only expect to find this one cluster in the 1 of sky that we have searched

7517613 after months of wrangling democratic and republican leaders in congress struck a deal on thursday to overhaul the rules on the governments wiretapping powers and provide what amounts to legal immunity to the phone companies that took part in president bushs program of eavesdropping without warrants after the sept 11 attacks the deal expanding the governments powers to spy on terrorism suspects in some major respects would strengthen the ability of intelligence officials to eavesdrop on foreign targets it would also allow them to conduct emergency wiretaps without court orders on american targets for a week if it is determined that important national security information would otherwise be lost if approved as appears likely the agreement would be the most significant revision of surveillance law in 30 years

7517639 during the current conflict between russia and georgia a number of statements have been made by several leaders of osce participating states in connection with the rights of states to protect their citizens and in particular national minorities residing abroad
7517640 both the past and the present have shown us that when states take unilateral actions to defend protect or support their citizens or
7517641 one of the bedrocks of international law is that the protection of human rights including minority rights is primarily the responsibility of the states where minorities reside this also holds true in the case of minorities holding dual citizenship
7517642 protecting minority rights is also the responsibility of the international community including the so called
7517643 states should refrain from conferring citizenship en masse to residents of other states which is in violation of the principles of sovereignty and good neighbourly relations
7517644 when human rights including minority rights are violated on a large scale as in cases of ethnic cleansing mass expulsion and acts of terror the international community has a duty to intervene the purpose legitimacy and effectiveness of such intervention are best assured through multilateral operations if unilateral steps are taken particularly by neighbouring states the motives and credibility of their actions may be brought into question

7517671 language of choice is not in fact the most compelling way to engage most americans on abortion it doesnt resonate with most voters in the center and it activates negative stereotypes about feminism and promiscuity

7517801 i was instructed not to look him in the eye and that was my first experience of honouring someones privacy to the point where you look away when they come near you
7517802 just about every day he was at my house and wed play nintendo games i was about five feet tall wearing a back brace due to scoliosis i dont think either one of us was doing that great with the ladies in high school john was still kind of fitting into a niche hes more than made up for himself with how hes done since then

7517806 making clothes together in our studio makes us feel complete we probably sound like a group of grannies in a knitting circle but its the truth and it gives us some control over our visual identity

7517826 are you sure you want to live like common people
7517827 we know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines

7517835 this transaction accelerates the overseas expansion plans of ncs by providing operational scale and an enlarged regional footprint the it services market is a high growth area and the potential for growth is enormous
7517836 moving forward with scs cementing a win in cooperation with outsourcer eds for the singapore governments standard operating environment soeasy project the new organization will not only be a force in singapore but can potentially leverage its know how for greater geographic expansion throughout the asia pacific region
7517837 while ncs has been a key systems integrator and provider of managed services in singapore scs also brings increased vertical depth with their portfolio of trusted services which encompass specialist e government and healthcare services
7517838 to be a significant solutions provider to business customers in the asia pacific region
7517839 a much stronger strategic position in the near to medium term
7517840 over 80 percent of scs revenues are still derived from the singapore market
7517841 adding any new and significant core competencies that ncs does not already possess
7517842 singtel will have to demonstrate that it can operate scs business significantly better and grow the regional revenues significantly in order to justify the price premium it is paying for scs
7517843 to consolidate the companys operations and human resources without unnecessary delay

7517845 then you get in your game and you start watching the film and you see yourself moving in the pocket and you realize thats why i was doing that
7517846 hes just got to stick with what coach cutcliffe teaches him

7517853 the olympics have increased chinese peoples confidence at first there was a lot of criticism but since the opening ceremony and the start of the games theres been widespread praise and this comes in a year where our confidence was shaken by natural disasters and other events
7517854 china is trying to show to the world this face that they are a modern progressing country thats open access for everyone and it really is not the truth the real face is one that denies freedom of speech that denies it brutally and violently when it can
7517855 perhaps some of the western governments and human rights organizations had it a little bit backwards where they expected that the olympics would be a time for more freedom
7517856 i think the government and i think theres substantial popular support for this view view the olympics in a very different way as a time to have temporary controls on society

7517984 besonders wichtig ist dass f r die fahrg ste der wiener linien die m glichkeit besteht jederzeit die gebotenen kommunikationsm glichkeiten des unternehmens zu nutzen und am ende der anrufleitung kein computer sondern eine mitarbeiterin bzw ein mitarbeiter als kontaktperson zur verf gung steht auch verzichten die wiener linien obwohl dies technisch l ngst m glich w re im bereich der u bahn auf einen fahrerlosen betrieb f r die wiener linien hat die sicherheit der fahrg ste oberste priorit t

7518014 i want to do my best and try to make it permanent
7518015 i had a few options but i chose sunderland because of the manager the club has big ambitions and really good players
7518016 i feel like i have a point to prove because i think i can do really well in the premier league and show people i can score goals in this division
7518017 the way i play my game i think i am made for england
7518018 el hadji called me he had a few words with me and said the ambition at the club is good so i said good
7518019 its a good lively forward line with me and el hadji and dont forget about kenwyne jones as well and plenty of other players who are quality
7518020 nobody expects sunderland to be a good team but i know the boys now and we want to show people that we are a good club and that we can go and do well
7518021 we can surprise a lot of teams like we did against tottenham
7518022 it was a surprise for me to score on my debut and i was very happy for the guys for the manager and for the people who support me
7518023 but i think we deserved the win we played well we always tried to play football and we fought against tottenham who are a good team
7518024 djibril will be one of the top scorers in the premier league i know it
7518025 it is great for him to be at sunderland and great for the premier league to have him
7518026 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7518027 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7518028 actives et la maison et m res de familles et femmes tout court
7518029 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7518030 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7518031 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7518032 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7518033 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7518034 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7518035 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7518036 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7518037 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7518038 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7518039 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7518040 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7518041 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7518042 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7518043 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7518044 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7518045 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7518046 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7518047 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7518048 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7518049 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7518050 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7518051 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7518052 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7518053 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7518054 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7518055 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7518056 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

7518064 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7518065 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7518066 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7518067 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7518068 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7518069 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7518070 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7518071 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7518072 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7518073 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7518074 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7518075 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7518076 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7518077 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7518078 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7518079 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7518080 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7518081 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7518082 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7518083 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7518084 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7518085 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7518086 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7518087 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7518088 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7518089 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7518090 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7518091 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7518092 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7518093 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7518094 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7518095 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7518096 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7518097 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7518098 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7518099 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7518100 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7518101 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7518102 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues

7518162 the belief that this dream could be achieved with no risk no worry and no money down was at the center of the american romance with real estate in the early years of this decade and not just in merced how long will the economy have to pay the price for that illusion the experience of merced which rose higher and fell faster than nearly anywhere else suggests that recovery from the national real estate debacle will be painful and protracted in the three years since housing peaked here the median sales price has fallen by 50 there are thousands of foreclosures on the market the asking prices on those properties are so low that competitive bidding a hallmark of the boom is back

7518226 in our meeting with transportation experts it became clear that the transport ministry is planning on canceling a large part of the haredi lines that exist in the city
7518227 force the ultra orthodox population in specific neighborhoods to take the light train and in other neighborhoods to ride the regular lines
7518228 we conclude that the light train is not at all suitable for the ultra orthodox communitys needs neither worldly nor spiritually the goal of forcing the ultra orthodox community to use the light train constitutes a severe spiritual danger
7518229 the transport ministry intends on altering the bus routes that serve the general public and move them to the geula neighborhood and thus to completely ruin the neighborhoods spiritual character

7518308 more companies are realizing that risk uncertainty is inherent in everything that happens you start with the risks you analyze those risks and then you determine what actions you need to take to manage those risks when you have that thought process in a holistic erm program it can be very effective
7518309 technology is more and more important for effective risk management its very difficult to manage all the risks as well as the accountabilities and responsibilities and to track those activities this holds true for the communication thats needed up and downstream in the organization as well technology is almost essential at this point to do it well
7518310 this podcast series truly captures the goal of our recent executive erm forum to address how risk management activities have evolved over the past year particularly as a result of current us economic conditions
7518311 these interviews not only serve as a great way to gain best practices from some of the most forward thinking executives in the grc space but also provide viewers with the knowledge needed to evaluate the strength of their own risk management programs and initiatives

7518329 a vast array of individuals seriously over rate the importance of money in making themselves and others happy
7518330 study after study from psychology shows that money doesnt equal happiness
7518331 people are wedded to the idea that more money will bring them more happiness
7518332 when they think of the effects of more money they are failing to factor in the fact that when they get more money they are going to want even more money when they get more money they are going to want a bigger house they never have enough money but what they do is sacrifice their family life and health to get more money

7518338 when we moved the show to atlanta seven of the top 10 states were from the southeast we hope by going to las vegas that we will attract manufacturers from texas arizona california and washington as well as states east of the mississippi this show is expected to be the second largest fabtech event ever with more than 800 exhibitors
7518339 the show also offers young people in america canada and mexico the opportunity to see what a career in manufacturing can mean
7518340 people who come to fabtech will see a life and career in manufacturing that you dont read about or see every day a lot has changed in the last 50 years what you see today are very sophisticated machine tools run by programmers and software engineers who produce precise parts in efficient ways

7518372 the way the military sees it if youre in the cargo hold of an airplane at high altitude and then drop by parachute to a hot desert that would be a temperature shock situation
7518373 dust and humidity is dealt with in a couple of ways
7518374 it cannot only survive drops to concrete but also constant jouncing in the back of a jeep
7518375 if the systems fall the drive wont get the full shock
7518376 the ssd flash drives are far more stable and less prone to error and read problems than a spinning platter drive would be
7518377 they have accelerometers that can tell if it is falling so it can remove a drive head from the disk so any shock that occurs wont damage the surface
7518378 its really hard to get that drive arm to dig into the surface even though they are floating microns above the disk to read the data to get them to go that extra bit takes quite a lot
7518379 panasonic engineers have developed special materials including proprietary super sheet technology as well as other forms of padding used in shock mounting to protect these drives in the extreme environments in which they work
7518380 we have deployed ssd based toughbook notebooks in the most extreme vibration environments such as for example helicopters where vibration is a significant risk
7518381 these things are not dainty theres a large heat envelope
7518382 they can also have doors that can be opened and closed or port covers you can open to run them in a way thats not fully locked down but then seal it all back up

7518384 wrel technology employs strongly coupled resonators a principle similar to the way a trained singer can shatter a glass using her voice intel said at the receiving resonators natural frequency energy is absorbed efficiently just as a glass absorbs acoustic energy at its natural frequency with this technology enabled in a laptop for example batteries could be recharged when the laptop gets within several feet of the transmit resonator the company explained

7518395 its not about introducing a curriculum for young children or making them read or write before theyre ready quite the reverse
7518396 learning and development requirements that all early years providers must by law deliver
7518397 the early learning goals which young children should have acquired by the end of the academic year in which they reach five
7518398 the matters skills and processes which are required to be taught to young children
7518399 it makes a point of mentioning the welfare requirements but the statutory learning requirements which have caused so much disagreement and dissent are noticeable by their absence
7518400 there is plenty in the statutory framework that both parents and practitioners have taken strong and principled issue with because of its developmental inappropriateness
7518401 but in stark contrast there is pretty much nothing that any parent or practitioner would take issue with in this parents booklet
7518402 the booklet seems to amount to little more than a propaganda exercise specially launched by the department for children schools and families and designed to head off any parents revolt about the eyfs
7518403 our government helped the citizens by maintaining order it did little else its expenses were low and so taxes were low
7518404 it would be a hard government that should tax its people one tenth part of their income
7518405 in 1940 our federal state and local governments taxed us one fifth of our incomes but franklin could not have guessed the tremendous growth of this country
7518406 as students our young citizens are given school buildings our government does hundreds of things for us in our everyday life
7518407 in the western world of the nineteenth century various political and economic groups believed that government operated schools could be a mechanism for assuring the distribution of their particular ideology to the population
7518408 here was the principle that government had authority to control schools and it was well enunciated in the new england colonies early in their histories
7518409 colonial legislatures showed a slackening of effort to require compulsory education and gave greater freedom to private groups to educate children in schools of their own preference
7518410 unhampered by the control of the town meeting and little influenced by traditional modes of procedure these institutions were free to grow with the town
7518411 the private schools were free to originate and to adapt their courses of instruction to the interests of the students
7518412 shall these adopted citizens become a part of the body politic and firm supporters of liberal institutions or will they prove to our republic what the goths and huns were to the roman empire
7518413 she assassinates massacres poisons tortures intrigues she commits every crime in the calendar such as arson pillage murder and rape
7518414 from the standpoint of the public schools the cpi was the first major attempt to bring the goals of locally controlled schools into line with the policy objectives of the federal government
7518415 believed that local control of educational policy was a major hindrance in adapting the public schools to the needs of the united states as a world leader
7518416 for the most part board members are drawn from the more favored economic and social classes
7518417 lack of confidence in the public school on the ground that it is under the control of the great capitalistic and employing interests
7518418 the institution offers itself as a powerful agency of propaganda to any group able to secure dominion over it

7518425 when crews arrived they found an 18 month old boy who had suffered a very serious head injury
7518426 they were told that it had been caused by an airgun

7518431 after the georgian leadership lost their marbles as they say all the problems got worse and a military conflict erupted
7518432 and i believe we should handle other existing conflicts in this context
7518433 we have agreed to meet and discuss the transdniestria settlement
7518434 i think there is a good reason to do this today i see good prospects of reaching a settlement
7518435 russia is ready to continue its efforts towards finally solving the transdniestrian crisis
7518436 thank god during all these years we had enough brains and reserve not to allow a similar deterioration of situation
7518437 frozen conflicts are a real volcano which can blow up anytime
7518438 that is why taking into account what had happened elsewhere it would be useful if we exercised again such wisdom not to allow such things to repeat in our country

7518445 theyre behind bars weve got them on diego garcia in bagram air field in guant namo
7518446 we have received concurring confirmations that united states agencies have used diego garcia which is the international legal responsibility of the uk in the processing of high value detainees
7518447 he had received credible evidence from well placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on diego garcia between 2002 and 2003
7518448 the cia officer surprised attendees by volunteering the information apparently to demonstrate that the agency was doing its best to obtain valuable intelligence

7518485 it brings a tremendous sense of peace to my life
7518486 he fought for this country and helped open some doors
7518487 he helped show people the idea of black people as second class citizens was wrong
7518488 he was dad he gave me an allowance he gave me chores he was like all the other fathers on the base
7518489 it wasnt until i was out of college that i realized he was a hero
7518490 theres no getting away from the peace message its on my neck down to my waist
7518491 we do feel to some extent that these elections have sabotaged our peace actions and messaging because the media is completely focused on the two candidates
7518492 just about every place mccain goes we have somebody confronting him
7518493 we want the undecided voters to see we associate mccain with more war and with the failed bush policy and of course we want the media to cover it
7518494 theres a lot of very creative people in the group
7518495 they make so many different crafty visually brilliant things and they love using their talents to push this along and see their costume on the news

7518507 obamas stadium address on thursday the 45th anniversary of rev martin luther king jr s i have a dream speech will result in effusive and overwhelming press coverage this coverage will be impenetrable and will undoubtedly impact the polls
7518508 the one returns this time to lead us to the road to denver
7518509 we will encourage voters to look beyond the glamour of barack obamas celebrity status to his inexperience and lack of accomplishment
7518510 even democrats in ohio are calling on senator obama to offer something more than a lofty speech ohioans are beginning to wonder if theres anything more to barack obama than his trusty teleprompter
7518511 hiding out in one of your seven houses while your surrogates launch more low road attacks is not a surprising strategy for john mccain
7518512 but given his shocking disconnect with the struggles of american families john mccain would be better served using this time to rewrite his economic plan that was authored by an adviser who thinks we are a nation of whiners and which offers nothing more than the same failed bush economic policies of the last eight years
7518513 generally the court accepts only cases that it finds interesting but sometimes a what the hell element seems to come into play

7518521 thanks to my prisoner of war experience i had as they say in politics a good first story to sell
7518522 is one of the most stirring narratives ever told on the presidential trail a trail full of heroic war stories
7518523 examines the roots of the hensley fortune and john mccains implacable bond to the liquor industry how it has enriched him personally and as a politician and how those ties have dictated his actions on questions of public policy the hensley saga meanwhile swirls with bygone accounts of illicit booze gambling horse racing deceit and crime james hensley embarked on his road to riches as a bootlegger a 1948 federal criminal indictment charged the hensleys made approximately 1 284 false entries related to the sale of thousands of cases of liquor by their two companies united sales company in phoenix and united distributors in tucson
7518524 if were in nato we wont have to worry about nato attacking romania over our relations with our hungarian minority the way you attacked yugoslavia

7518531 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond

7518534 consumers need to be able to communicate in a safe environment with debt collectors
7518535 debt collectors are required by federal law and have been since 1977 to treat you the same way the wal mart nyse wmt greeter treats you with truth fairness dignity and respect
7518536 this is an attempt to collect a debt and any information obtained will be used for that purpose
7518537 very very real need for debt collectors to take the publics perception of the industry very seriously
7518538 there are babies whove been born and are now walking and talking since we started this campaign

7518541 their lifestyle hasnt changed whats changed is how expensive its all becoming and how static their income has been and what you see is a growing sense of struggle
7518542 were trying it out to see if it will help with the grocery bill
7518543 were just now starting to feel worried about how things are going to go in the next few months
7518544 for all our own concerns we have a lot of sympathy for younger people with families and all those expenses
7518545 recent further price increases in raw materials have been larger than tmcs cost reduction efforts are able to offset
7518546 we know for a fact a lot of localized populations have suffered dramatic declines
7518547 from that its probably not too big a leap to think its probably at least somewhat true across the board
7518548 the biggest challenge and unanswered question is the effects of climate change
7518549 to me its a plan that says theyre going to do more planning
7518550 my study plots in california at least indicate theyve continued to plummet and very seriously so
7518551 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7518552 its really very interesting that with all these efforts that have gone into building safer highways safer cars better enforcement this really dramatic change were seeing is due to economics to the price of gasoline
7518553 this is really the first time since the 1970s that people are thinking about driving and about what is the cost of an individual trip
7518554 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster

7518562 we need citizens to call us when they have a law enforcement need

7518582 were really hoping that these food prices and these fuel prices settle down
7518583 we want to maintain an increase in health foods for our children and still be able to afford it
7518584 part of the rationale behind the escalation of a la carte prices was to offset the increase in operational costs without raising meal prices

7518589 i am very excited that senator obama has selected senator biden to be his running mate
7518590 the obama biden ticket provides the united states with a new and meaningful dialogue with world leaders and will improve americas standing with our allies and the global community
7518591 as a governor i know the value of having reliable partners who are willing to tackle tough challenges in washington
7518592 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7518593 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7518594 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7518595 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7518596 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7518597 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7518598 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security

7518600 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7518601 many others were discussed but my impression was that those three a few weeks ago were really the centerpiece kaine bayh and biden
7518602 who about three days after i announced was able to stand with me in the seat of the old confederacy right here in virginia and say the time for change has come
7518603 i have had interactions with the obama campaign over the last several months but i will not get into details
7518604 my answer to any question about the subject that i think youre referring to is that all inquiries should be directed at senator obamas campaign
7518605 obviously the most important question is is this person ready to be president
7518606 can this person help me govern are they going to be an effective partner in creating the kind of economic opportunity here at home and guiding us through some dangerous waters internationally
7518607 i want somebody who is going to be able to challenge my thinking and not simply be a yes person when it comes to policymaking
7518608 i want to ask visa again the first time all papers was well prepared
7518609 it would be great if sen mccain came to lynchburg particularly this fall
7518610 he came here early on and lynchburg is a small town
7518611 i think one stop per campaign is about all we can hope for
7518612 windows la usa como si fuera ram lo que tienen q hacer es lo siguiente
7518613 i think hes made a great pick with joe biden
7518614 as far as i know we are the only prison program in the country that can handle statewide fresh produce frozen produce meat and milk all of it delivered to any institution in less than 24 hours
7518615 we have some talented individuals locked up here in the state its saved a lot of money
7518616 id never been close to a cow id never been near a tractor before i came here
7518617 by selecting joe biden for vice president barack obama has shown voters that not even governor tim kaine can hide the fact that he is out of touch with the core values held by the hard working families of virginia virginians deserve a president and a vice president who understand that we need a comprehensive solution to the energy crisis lower taxes for virginias families and who have a record on strong national security what virginia doesnt want is an inexperienced presidential ticket that will raise taxes on families and industries that are most important to virginias economy john mccain believes in lower taxes energy solutions and a stronger national security voters in virginia will support john mccain for president because they always know where he stands
7518618 barack obama has sent virginia voters the message by choosing senator joe biden as his running mate that he just wasnt seeing the momentum in virginia that he had hoped barack obama spent two full days campaigning in virginia and his message is not resonating there is no question in the minds of voters that he will raise taxes on virginia families ignore the energy crisis and continue to support retreat and surrender in iraq voters in virginia will support john mccain because he is a proven leader and ready to be commander in chief on day one he believes in lower taxes for virginia families and has an all of the above plan to solve our energy crisis i am proud to help john mccain to victory in virginia in november
7518619 congratulations to my friend and colleague in the u s senate joe biden for being selected as barack obamas running mate however i am confident as virginians continue to get to know barack obamas record and counterproductive proposals they will see he is out of touch with the core values and issues most important to our families barack obamas plan for our economic competiveness includes raising taxes on individuals retirees and small business owners and creating more carter era taxes and restrictions on our american energy solutions john mccain in comparison has a proven record of character and putting our country first senator mccain will provide the credible leadership america needs for our economic competitiveness national security and energy independence
7518620 at long last the speculation about who senator barack obama would choose as his running mate is over i congratulate senator biden on being selected to run with senator obama in november however it is obvious that senator biden will do nothing to help senator obamas chances of winning in virginia i remain convinced that virginia will vote for john mccain he is the only candidate who has the background knowledge and experience to lead our country at a critical time in our history and he is the only candidate who has put forth positive solutions on important issues such as national security economic security and energy security i look forward to campaigning with senator mccain to victory here in virginia this november
7518621 virginia voters will not support an obama biden ticket this is a ticket that believes in higher taxes more government inaction in the face of rising energy prices and that fundamentally fails to understand the true nature of the enemies we face abroad the contrast between an obama biden ticket and the candidacy of john mccain could not be more stark or more important john mccain believes that lowering taxes is the best way to strengthen the economy and create jobs in virginia while barack obama already voted for higher taxes on virginia families john mccain believes that our energy security is dependent on offshore exploration and nuclear power while barack obamas energy plan is for virginians to merely inflate their tires john mccain believes that we should leave iraq a secure nation while barack obama advocates timetables and surrender there is a clear choice in this campaign and virginians will choos e john mccain this november
7518622 an obama biden ticket lacks the crucial military experience that voters are looking for
7518623 a few years ago we at pike place fish market committed ourselves to becoming
7518624 mir negro yo creo que el progresismo blanco permitido por el sistema no sirve para un carajo
7518625 pensar que fue el frepaso y con posterioridad la alianza la m xima expresi n de ese progresismo permitido por el sistema
7518626 entramos en una din mica del 2 de inflaci n mensual y lo m s grave es que el enfriamiento de la econom a que ya se siente en varios sectores no est ayudando a frenar los aumentos de precios
7518627 para agosto estamos proyectando una inflaci n en torno al 2 por ciento lo que implica cierta aceleraci n ya que hasta hace pocos meses est bamos trabajando con un promedio del 1 5 por ciento mensual
7518628 en agosto los alimentos se muestran un poco m s tranquilos pero el problema es que hubo otros aumentos importantes en taxis y cigarrillos a lo que hay que sumar el tradicional impacto de las vacaciones de invierno en el rubro esparcimiento
7518629 para la estimaci n supusimos aumentos en prepagas y otros rubros como las expensas y la educaci n con lo que si el mes cierra nicamente con la suba en la medicina prepaga el rango se podr a bajar al 1 5 por ciento lo que igualmente representa un ndice muy alto

7518631 it didnt have enough women and african americans were actively excluded from any participation and the party was terribly boss ridden governors and mayors just actually chose the delegates and that seemed to me undemocratic
7518632 i decided when i was chairman that we ought to make the democratic party live up to what it called itself
7518633 well there were a lot of hard feelings in the old days but there was no way to express them the bosses just pretty much decided who would be the nominee to paraphrase winston churchill democracy is messy you know it often makes a spectacle of itself but it beats any other system you can think of
7518634 children while it doesnt occur often are probably the most vulnerable just because if someone steals my childs identity they can use that for 10 to 15 years before they the child apply for a loan and they find that their credit is really not good
7518635 we dont ask for age in our identity theft surveys
7518636 our self reported anecdotal data indicates that about 5 percent of the complaints last year were for people 18 and under
7518637 many people find out after theyre over the age of 18 that they were victims of identity theft when they were under 18
7518638 the conventional wisdom is that its about 500 000 people a year who are children who become victims of identity theft
7518639 what most people do not understand is that credit issuers may not have a way to verify the age of the applicant
7518640 the information on the application is typically taken at face value this is particularly true with telephone and internet applications
7518641 a child should not have a report unless someone has started to apply for credit using that childs social security number
7518642 if you ask for a report for a child and theres no report thats the best result because if there is no credit history there wont be a fraudulent account opened
7518643 its highly unlikely that the lender will open an account if there is no credit history
7518644 if we get a request for a credit report that has a birth date that belongs to a minor we will not provide a credit report
7518645 receiving a preapproved credit card offer in your childs name might upset you as a parent
7518646 however it might only be an innocent marketing tool sent by an affiliate of your bank because you opened a college fund for your child
7518647 if you are told that there is no credit report this is probably not a case of financial identity theft
7518648 charismatics are insufficiently missional if a charismatic is also reformed in theology there can be a tendency to be passive in mission
7518649 a missional church sees itself as an outpost with a view to expand and add disciples of jesus a missional church should not be defined by the number of people in a room on a sunday but rather as the number of people on mission together
7518650 our data do support the premise that risk factor profiles vary by breast cancer subtype and that hormonal risk factors have a greater impact on luminal type breast cancers than her 2 overexpressing or triple negative tumors
7518651 further research is needed to clarify the epidemiology of her 2 overexpressing and triple negative tumors because at the current time no consistent risk factors for either of these 2 subtypes have been identified
7518652 compared with luminal tumors both her 2 overexpressing and triple negative tumors have a poorer prognosis
7518653 however to our knowledge differences in the epidemiology of these subtypes are not well defined
7518654 we figured this was our alamo and wed defend it
7518655 i looked at my nephew and said lets get the pump and get out of here
7518656 the top stayed in place but the whole foundation collapsed
7518657 we were one of two people in the area who had flood coverage
7518658 wed been living out of the house for three weeks and spiraling into debt
7518659 beautiful wetlands behind the house that connected to the kickapoo river
7518660 we sometimes had 20 to 30 egrets standing out there in the water
7518661 old timers say that you just hose out the house and move back in
7518662 were in our sixties and theres a world of difference between going through this when youre in your thirties and when youre older
7518663 still counting the days i been without you 1 2 3 4 still counting the days that youve been gone
7518664 networkd is a strategic acquisition for sparxent it has an excellent reputation a strong customer base and it will become the platform for future growth

7518670 today we must fulfill what is i think our historic mission to defend small countries from aggressors
7518671 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian state
7518672 the population of georgia will feel more safe from today from the russian aggression
7518673 they will feel safe not because the destroyer is here but because they will feel they are not alone facing the russian aggression
7518674 there are a lot of delegates here who had passionate choices in an extended primary season
7518675 we feel confidant that if we can demonstrate a record of change a record of vision a team of barack obama and joe biden can convince democrats republicans and independents to support a ticket of change in november
7518676 i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment a lot of democrats will vote mccain its ok really
7518677 i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us
7518678 he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7518679 thank you very much i am so pleased to be on a ticket with
7518680 and we passed them out last week and today were just picking them up we had a given date where we were gonna pick them up and we got all the school supplies
7518681 theres a hundred plus thousand dollars in renovations so all this money will go to them to spend to renovate their house
7518682 with the current indecisiveness between tlac and aep appalachian about who is going to do the conversion there is no sense in talking about it until it is settled
7518683 each day during which such violation continues shall be considered as a new offense
7518684 with the rise in the cost of living especially with energy and food prices escalating so rapidly more middle class families are finding it difficult just to get by in this back to school season
7518685 even in times of a bad economy like you find now sales of hunting licenses are going up more people than ever are going hunting right now
7518686 we figure we got almost every single person waiting in line
7518687 i think the democrats are trying to steer as far away from his campaign as they can and i dont blame them
7518688 bob goodlatte is a tremendous congressman youre going to have a very hard time unseating an incumbent like him
7518689 i was just happy to be there with all those wonderful people and help spread our message
7518690 at the state level they probably think goode is more vulnerable than goodlatte but we dont feel like that at the local level
7518691 its very very hard to beat an incumbent but if anyone can do it this guy can
7518692 you could tell it was a wreck it was sliding you could tell i jumped up immediately
7518693 i ran to see what it was and it was a body laying there a medic was there
7518694 ive actually learned to do a little bit at a time throughout the summer and it helps catch the sales the really good sales
7518695 i had a 14 gift certificate the other day so i got two rolls of paper for 61 cents i was very excited about that so i definitely take advantage of any kinds of discounts
7518696 for my supplies for my students i tried to cut it down a little bit i try not to ask too much of them
7518697 ive seen some of the lists theyve gotten a little shorter theyve actually cut down on the things like the clorox wipes and the baby wipes and things like that now theyre just optional so we dont necessarily have to buy them
7518698 those teachers were excellent examples of what it means to work hard up until the last day
7518699 its difficult to do that however im really excited about those weve hired
7518700 we hired experience now we didnt hire as much experience as we lost
7518701 i got my room in a little bit of order
7518702 probably the biggest challenge is to meet every student where they need to be met
7518703 i think the biggest thing for ninth graders is getting them to buy into their education and that they need to graduate
7518704 i love school i love education i love to learn
7518705 you know you can take all the classes you can take and do student teaching and do observations and what not but theres nothing like the on job experience and theres just nothing to replace it
7518706 i always try and remember when i started out and how awkward it was and how you feel so uncomfortable because its something brand new to you
7518707 those of us that have been around for a while we probably dont get as excited and apprehensive about it because weve done it for a while
7518708 i think its disappointing you dont have those resources to draw on

7518841 your honors there is still time to avoid the disaster of abortion in mexico
7518842 such as post abortion syndrome depression and possible complications from any kind of surgical procedure
7518843 by 2050 it will have lost one third of its population officials have already outlawed the advertising of abortion in state media and the closing of all private abortion clinics is under consideration
7518844 in the czech republic where the birth rate has fallen to 1 22 children per woman well below what is needed for replacement politicians have already begun implementing reforms to reduce the number of abortions
7518845 by 2025 25 of the island will be 60 or older thus provoking an unsustainable situation for the countrys economy
7518846 as i understand it this puts the burden on the attending physician who has determined since they were performing this procedure that in fact this is a nonviable fetus that if that fetus or child however way you want to describe it is now outside the mothers womb and the doctor continues to think that its nonviable but theres lets say movement or some indication that in fact theyre not just coming out limp and dead that in fact they would then have to call a second physician to monitor and check off and make sure that this is not a live child that could be saved
7518847 would not try to exercise the sort of medical measures and practices that would be involved in saving that child
7518848 really designed simply to burden the original decision of the woman and the physician to induce labor and perform an abortion
7518849 lets trust the guy who just botched the abortion to determine whether or not he actually did botch the abortion

7518944 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7518945 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7518946 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7518947 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7518948 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful

7518963 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7518964 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7518965 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7518966 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7518967 this is a planning took where all things are going
7518968 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7518969 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7518970 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7518971 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7518972 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7518973 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7518974 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7518975 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7518976 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7518977 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7518978 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7518979 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7518980 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7518981 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7518982 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7518983 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7518984 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7518985 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7518986 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7518987 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7518988 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7518989 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7518990 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7518991 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7518992 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7518993 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7518994 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7518995 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7518996 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7518997 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7518998 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7518999 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7519000 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7519001 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7519002 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7519003 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7519004 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7519005 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7519006 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7519007 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7519008 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7519009 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7519010 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7519011 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7519012 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7519013 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7519014 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7519015 security professionals especially for larger facilities campuses and military bases need the option of going mobile
7519016 skm mobile enables them to view their cameras in real time and be alerted when incidents occur but not be tied down to a security office we are thrilled to be on the forefront of mobility for video surveillance providing this critical solution to help organizations ensure the safety of people and assets

7519026 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7519027 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7519028 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7519029 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7519030 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7519031 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7519032 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7519033 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7519034 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7519035 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7519036 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7519037 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

7519048 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7519049 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain

7519057 its not something i care to discuss with the public only because i think its disrespectful to my husband i wouldnt want him to talk about all of his ex girlfriends

7519061 there have been more than 40 million abortions since 1973
7519062 since january 22 1973 roe v wade 52 520 348 babies have been aborted in the united states
7519063 the stakes of this election will be made very clear
7519064 senator obamas carefully hedged answers obscure more than they explain and this was the case in his conversation with rick warren
7519065 listening to my opponent at saddleback you would never know that this is a politician who long since left behind any middle ground on the abortion issue
7519066 he is against parental notification laws and against restrictions on taxpayer funding for abortions
7519067 in the illinois senate a bipartisan majority passed legislation to prevent the horrific practice of partial birth abortion senator obama opposed that bill voting against it in committee and voting present on the senate floor
7519068 in 2002 congress unanimously passed a federal law to require medical care for babies who survive abortions living breathing babies whom senator obama described as quote previable
7519069 this merciful law was called the born alive infants protection act illinois had a version of the same law and barack obama voted against it
7519070 at saddleback he assured a reporter that hed have voted yes on that bill if it had contained language similar to the federal version of the born alive infants protection act
7519071 even though the language of both the state and federal bills was identical senator obama said people were quote lying about his record
7519072 when that record was later produced he dropped the subject but didnt withdraw the slander and now even senator obamas campaign has conceded that his claims and accusations were false
7519073 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake

7519076 pro life voters of either party can now support sen obama on the basis that more lives will be saved than if they had just taken a moral stand hoping to overturn roe v wade
7519077 im just speaking to one issue at a time here
7519078 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
7519079 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out

7519140 the realisation came as a thunderbolt i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7519141 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7519142 during prime ministers questions she could rise from the front bench in an economic debate and recite the rate of inflation all the way back to william gladstone without a note
7519143 on any visit id pop into the kitchen to scan the noticeboard where her calendar was written out before going to see her in the sitting room
7519144 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7519145 when i invited a friend round to mums house for tea he engaged her in conversation about mikhail gorbachev quick as a flash she snapped back into iron lady mode and was utterly engaging it was as if the dementia had sharpened her powers of long term recall
7519146 im not worried about the reliability of my car as you can tell because for the past 18 months weve had phenomenal reliability
7519147 thats obviously due to the whole package the whole team has put together and the mercedes engines great the car is great
7519148 weve not really got any problems which means we can focus on developing the car rather than worrying about reliability which is a bonus for us
7519149 we need to work very hard to fix these engine problems as it will be the key for the end of the championship
7519150 ive already mentioned consistency is crucial and reliability is part of being consistent
7519151 if you have a single problem youre not consistent and in being consistent you are talking about the performance reliability and the drivers
7519152 all of these things are very important from now through to the end of the season
7519153 it was not a nice weekend but it is not the first time
7519154 we are now in a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted i think we still have a chance to come back
7519155 we just need to get things as we want and try again

7519166 one must always take threats seriously both those made by israel and by mr hassan nasrallah because this is a very inflammatory region
7519167 but honestly this time i dont take either side very seriously and i hope i am not mistaken

7519172 but over the past nine years the whole attitude to the problem has become very antagonistic theres little interest politically and publicly in providing proper treatment facilities it has done such disservice to children
7519173 it was 8am on a monday over a year ago when suddenly there were all these voices in my house i thought they were jehovahs witnesses at first then they said they were the police they didnt tell me why they were there for ages but they knew things about my children their names and what they were doing i got more and more scared i dont think ive ever shaken so badly then they showed me the search warrant i couldnt believe my eyes the words indecent images of children i was in shock and had no inkling of what my partner was doing yet at the same time i had a sort of sudden understanding of why he hadnt been easy to live with for so long i had to send the police off to the business we run to arrest him i thought thats the end of my world the first thing he said when he was arrested was im going to have to commit suicide thats the first thing i thought hed do when i read the search warrant ive known him for 20 years i knew what hed think meanwhile they searched the house took away any computer materials the senior policewoman came with me to wake my teenage daughter i told her what had happened she didnt take it in then we went to the school my other daughters were taken into a room one by one with me and their older sister and the police and told what had happened they were devastated then without me they were questioned about their relationship with their father it was devastating that their dad had this interest and also that someone might think he was doing that to them which was not the case they chewed us up and spat out how do you deal with it we did lots of talking we were all sitting on a bed that night and someone thought of dad all on his own and we sent him a text saying we loved and supported him and were there for him he didnt come home he could have but didnt it was better that we had some space we spoke on the phone the next night it was dreadful hes such a kind hearted person and he felt strongly that he wanted his children to have a childhood yet it didnt occur to him that he was taking away someone elses ive always thought the people doing these things were monsters but i cant think that any more because this does not define him he has a heartfelt desire to deal with the problem and it is something he has to atone for he got a non custodial sentence but this has tainted him forever i feel tainted forever i didnt tell anyone for an awfully long time my mother and siblings dont know i did tell a few friends but aside from one couple who stood by both of us they support me but not him i dont blame them but it upsets me it doesnt work unless they support all of us im an open person but i cant communicate with people in the way i used to there is always this black cloud that i cant tell anyone about i feel sad about it but i made the choice for my family to have as normal a future as possible and for my future and his to be as normal as possible wed been together for years but actually got married after this happened just our daughters were present we realised our family was the most important thing in our life and as a couple we have a lot of work to do but that has to come after he has done the work on himself first if i didnt have absolute confidence that in his heart he wants to overcome this i couldnt do it none of us view his arrest as anything but positive because it is really the only route out he needed help to stop i know that he tried to stop himself at least once because actions he took which didnt make sense at the time now fall into place but how could anybody with three daughters addicted to illegal activities of this nature and on whom the entire family was financially dependent ever admit what he was doing
7519174 when my husband and i were first arrested we were about to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary so i thought i knew him
7519175 the police came to our door on a winters morning just after 6am arrested my husband and took away the hard drive of our computer

7519188 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
7519189 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
7519190 the overwhelming feeling expressed in more than 90 messages posted about the topic was that finding a northern ireland anthem could benefit the team
7519191 i heard poots spouting some rubbish about how northern ireland fans wouldnt stand for a change how dare he speak for all fans why not ask them first
7519192 for those who think it will diminish their britishness watch how hard sinn fein fight against this and ask yourselves why
7519193 mr poots is more and more increasingly out of touch with grassroots unionism i resent the fact that he would label anyone that disagrees with him as a lesser unionist
7519194 me being proud of being northern irish and wanting us to use a northern irish anthem doesnt make me any less british than you or devalue my unionism and not all northern ireland fans are unionists anyway you fool
7519195 poots reaction was totally predictable its just a stupid im more british than you points scoring exercise
7519196 its a small step in raising this important issue and it deserves discussion at all levels no matter the outcome
7519197 good on you basil dup sinn fein axis not in favour what a surprise
7519198 this would be a very positive step in my eyes the one and only chant i hate hearing at windsor is the old no surrender as it offends many of our own players i am pro union but that is neither here nor there and has nothing to do with supporting all 11 players wearing our green shirt
7519199 as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business
7519200 the refusal is based upon his felony conviction as he is not a politician going to the us on peace processing business he does not get a waiver to entry despite his conviction as other convicted ira members have
7519201 he could apply again but the likelihood of his being able to enter the states is slim to none given both his record and the political climate
7519202 there is a famous story from seoul in 1988 that there were so many used condoms on the roof terrace of the british teams residential block the night after the swimming concluded that the british olympic association sent out an edict banning outdoor sex here in beijing organisers have realised that such prohibitions are about as useful as banning breathing and have instead handed out thousands of free condoms to the athletes if you cant stop em at least make it safe

7519204 rania wannous spokeswoman for visit london said the issue has been

7519208 there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis
7519209 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7519210 i think there is a danger that sinn fein are trying to create a crisis policing and justice devolution can only occur if there is sufficient public confidence in the ability of politicians to handle such a sensitive matter i think the question is this will these remarks by sinn fein convince anyone out there that this is mature politics when people are threatening to pull the whole thing down
7519211 bearing in mind the statement went through their official press office one is left with the impression its a bit of kite flying by sinn f in these comments were not off the cuff or out of the blue
7519212 the criminal cases review commission recommended that his case go back to the court of appeal which this summer cleared him
7519213 aided and abetted by secret sects satanic groups and new age movements
7519214 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7519215 there is now widespread and growing concern among republicans at the failure to transfer policing and justice powers from london to belfast in due time
7519216 when sinn fein changed our policy on policing in the north accepting that a new beginning was being made it was with the prospect that policing and justice powers would be transferred by may of this year
7519217 it is now the end of august and we do not even have a date for transfer this is totally unacceptable
7519218 last saturday night there was a rocket attack in the middle of lisnaskea co fermanagh in which several police officers were nearly murdered there was no coordinated political response an emergency executive meeting was convened to address floods while the attempted murder of police went unmentioned if there was a rocket attack on garda in dublin city centre on saturday night brian cowen would call an emergency meeting of political and security figures to agree a strategy to deal with the threat while i dont want to over emphasise the dissident threat they are intent on killing police and there could be civilian deaths too

7519222 we all want to see a great britain football team its the right thing to do to have a successful olympics
7519223 gordon smith the sfas chief executive has spoken to the prime minister about team gb but we are unlikely to alter our position and remain opposed to the concept of a great britain football team
7519224 how can you have a great britain football team which includes northern ireland would you therefore support changing the name to team uk

7519237 the imaginary time bomb why an ageing population is not a social problem
7519238 historically modern societies double their wealth about every twenty five years this kind of growth projected across the next half century would dwarf the extra pension and other costs to society of more elderly dependents moreover it is far from certain that extra years of life mean extra years of ill health and dependency serious disease tends to be concentrated towards the end of life so living longer may simply postpone the point of onset without increasing the costs

7519283 there was tremendous pent up demand for vista sp1 either due to customer dissatisfaction with the product or because users were convinced of its benefits from all of the media hype surrounding its release no similar demand existed for windows xp service pack 3 most likely because overall the majority of users are quite happy with windows xp service pack 2 we found just a handful of users still running service pack 1
7519284 what seems clear from these numbers is that microsofts customers felt windows vista was in urgent need of a service pack 12 18 months after it was released while those still using windows xp were relatively happy with the platform and in no rush to patch it

7519303 its extremely important just to keep making forward progress rather than trying prematurely to come to some set of conclusions
7519304 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year there is a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7519305 there is no doubt that we seek peace and we are trying to seek our goals and there wont be peace without the release of all prisoners
7519306 this is a great joy for our mothers and our people but it remains a small step because we left behind us thousands of prisoners
7519307 its not easy to release prisoners especially prisoners that were involved directly in terrorist acts against innocent civilians

7519333 i think that kdb might have considered forming and leading a consortium to buy
7519334 but it appears burdensome for a state run institution to play a leading role in the purchase of a foreign company and take risks which may be more than financial
7519335 my point is that state run institutions may take a catalyst role in pursuing these kinds of deals

7519390 if you look at the film it didnt look like anything serious
7519391 i felt a little burn in my knee i wanted to go back out there but they wouldnt let me
7519392 i was ready i wanted to knock somebodys face off
7519393 it was painful but most of my pain was coming from my heart
7519394 so i was laughing my leg is over here over there almost apart from my body and im laughing because theyre joking

7519396 you could tell there was something that was very serious
7519397 im futuristic i might even become a knee surgeon now i can probably perform one
7519398 i almost fainted the first time i did it and it never got old
7519399 they are going to have to live in a society that is going to have to be more conservative with the use of fuel
7519400 as people drive less they are actually hurting the highways
7519401 people are consuming less motor fuel and not contributing as much back to the highway fund we want to keep everyone happy and healthy and to do that we need the funding
7519402 we have great transportation infrastructure however that infrastructure is aging and is almost 50 years old
7519403 unless there is some funding put into place we may go into simple maintenance mode
7519404 its cyclical it may drop 20 cents here and there but it will just continue to go higher
7519405 the miles traveled are likely to return to a normal pattern
7519406 the tunnels which are in surprisingly good condition were part of speers grand plans what we now call germania
7519407 interest is constantly growing we have about 150 000 visitors a year to the bunkers
7519408 that is partly why we want the bunkers to be protected they are an important part of the history of berlin
7519409 the project aims to harvest 14 million cubic meters 494 4 million cu ft of timber worth about 4 billion

7519413 boat collisions with submerged tree stumps cause many fatalities every year
7519414 maybe at the time we thought we had enough timber in our forest estates to sustain us now because of the decline we need to diversify

7519420 we urge china to take positive steps to address international and domestic concerns about its record on human rights and religious freedom
7519421 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7519422 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7519423 there is no money for facilities or training the war the security the difficulties with food and everything there are just many other internal difficulties to deal with
7519424 when we went back home my friends and i were rounded up and we were told if we did it again we would get killed some of my friends stopped being in sports i had many phone calls threatening me that if i didnt stop running i would get killed lately i do not have these problems i think probably they realized we just wanted to be athletes and were not involved with the government
7519425 the food is not something that is measured and given to us every day
7519426 the stadiums i never thought something like this existed in the world
7519427 the buildings in the city it was all very surprising it will probably take days to finish all the stories we have to tell
7519428 i didnt know what it was when i saw it
7519429 the olympic fire in the stadium everywhere i am it is always up there
7519430 its like the moon i look up wherever i go it is there
7519431 the good thing sports is the one thing which unites all of somalia
7519432 because of us the somali flag is raised among all the other nations flags you cant imagine how proud we were when we were marching in the opening ceremonies with the flag
7519433 despite the difficulties and everything weve had with our country we feel great pride in our accomplishment
7519434 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me
7519435 but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was very nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
7519436 we know that we are different from the other athletes
7519437 but we dont want to show it we try our best to look like all the rest we understand we are not anywhere near the level of the other competitors here we understand that very very well but more than anything else we would like to show the dignity of ourselves and our country

7519452 what i do want to point out is that while printing books on demand might sound like a great idea it is ultimately up to the photographer to perform quality control
7519453 i find it slightly surprising that while many photographers especially those who grew up before the so called digital revolution know the names of expert analog printers there does not appear to be a corresponding pool of expert digital printers
7519454 the men started to tell her that they can see she has financial problems they told her that they can help her to get out of the financial problems if she does what they tell her
7519455 when she came back they told her to leave everything she has with them she must go and collect two stones a few metres away from them she was further instructed not to look back when she went to collect the stones that will her overcome her financial problems

7519460 we shall not build in our cities or in their neighborhood new monasteries churches convents or monks cells nor shall we repair by day or by night such of them as fall in ruins or are situated in the quarters of the muslims
7519461 a policeman assigned to guard the archangel michael church in deshasha beni soueif province south of cairo hit three women while they were taking sand into the church to fix the floor which was cracked as result of water collection underneath
7519462 the archangel michael church in deshasha is but one example of the futility of any efforts to reform and unify construction and renovation laws for places of worship so long as security agents continue to violate existing laws in a discriminatory manner and with complete impunity
7519463 the decrease in net sales and comparable store sales was primarily due to the great success of harry potter and the deathly hallows in the prior year period
7519464 this quarter brought many challenges the difficult economic conditions continue to contribute to a soft sales environment where declining customer traffic and a price conscious consumer were clearly evident
7519465 we anticipate few changes in q3 for what will surely remain a challenging and highly competitive marketplace we remain focused on the fundamentals of our business that include cost control inventory management and offering the best possible value to our customers
7519466 i was told that you all need to take a class or something
7519467 it has nothing to do with your job if you take russian i want to take french
7519468 you cant i already told you what you are taking
7519469 well i dont care if you are taking a class that has nothing to do with your job so am i
7519470 next month im going on vacation to the ukraine and i want to learn russian
7519471 given that our results are backed by numerous experimental studies showing that incense is a powerful producer of particulate matter and that incense smoke contains carcinogenic substances i believe incense should be used with caution
7519472 that is frequent use in rooms where people live should be minimized or at least sufficient ventilation should be secured in our study we find the increased risk of cancer to be present in individuals reporting frequent use of incense for many years thus repeated exposure for years should probably be avoided
7519473 the american lung association is going to add it as a risk factor
7519474 its not nearly the danger of smoking a pack a day for 20 years but its a danger
7519475 certainly i think bathing yourself in particles is probably not the smartest thing in the world but i think very few people fill up their room with incense
7519476 its a population based study which means that you can make an association but not necessarily a conclusion
7519477 it probably promotes more work in the area of routine household items and things we need to be looking at more prospectively to make a clear cause and effect relationship
7519478 anything that affects air quality negatively is not a good thing
7519479 burning in general and the release of smoke these things are certainly to be avoided at the very least chemical irritants will set off asthma and thats reversible cancer is not reversible
7519480 this is not unlike the type of risk that one experiences from secondhand tobacco smoke
7519481 at the end of the day people who use incense casually i dont think thats a cause for major concern but those cultures which embrace incense as part of their daily lifestyles have to consider this has a real potential risk for cancer
7519482 the beijing olympics proceeded smoothly and its impossible to disagree
7519483 copii saraci care nu au sprijin de niciunde care nu beneficiaza de ajutorul unei vedete care sa sara in ajutorul lor
7519484 do you make a grant and send out a press release or can you find a way to really raise the visibility of the groups youre involved with
7519485 we can spotlight a hidden gem that you might not have heard of but that deserves to be known
7519486 we would never have that kind of money we want every dollar we raise to go to our kids and our programs so this is a wonderful opportunity and were very grateful
7519487 within two seconds from the time the kare segment went off the air
7519488 we see it as a really unique and innovative way to let people know about the groups were supporting
7519489 it also lets our employees know who we support and many of our employees have gotten involved with organizations after seeing them on the billboard
7519490 and you will not find a state that has offered as close a model to the ideal of a successful society as minnesota
7519491 by itself more than equals the state budget for all purposes just four years ago
7519492 placing first and primary emphasis on dollars rather than human values
7519493 government is not the solution to our problem government is the problem
7519494 i have often defended government against uninformed claims that it is wasteful or that its work is insignificant but i am still a republican i believe governments role should be limited people need to do what they can for themselves but government should do things for people that they cannot do or cannot do as well for themselves

7519500 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7519501 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7519502 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7519503 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly

7519840 on august 5 prior to the beijing games pastor romero had transformed two hotel rooms creating effigies of blood spattered torture victims and painting human rights slogans such as our world our nightmare the protest took place just days before president bush issued his strong condemnation of abuse of religious freedom in china after the protest pastor romero went into hiding and has been living in the open with the protection of a small shelter existing on rations he bought before leaving beijing
7519841 pastor eddie romero is a much loved church leader professor and family man whose actions are driven by deepest concern for the abused in china he took this exceptional step in order to draw much needed attention to the plight of those suffering persecution for their faith and other beliefs
7519842 while csw does not condone civil disobedience we strongly endorse the validity of the calls he is making for china to ratify the iccpr and to release the named prisoners his courage in handing himself over to the chinese authorities shows the depths with which he identifies with the suffering of the chinese people

7519844 it seems like that is far away but it is really soon
7519845 protect the openness of the internet a key reason the internet has been such a success is because it is the most open network in history it needs to stay that way barack obama strongly supports the principle of network neutrality to preserve the benefits of open competition on the internet users must be free to access content to use applications and to attach personal devices
7519846 when he was asked in 2006 about proposing net neutrality laws he said there was no need since any bit filtering violations would provoke such a huge public ruckus theyd have to hold congressional hearings anyway and theyd be standing room only
7519847 it would if the vice president had any actual power
7519848 we know where obama stands on this thats what matters here

7519858 if we ufpj had 100 000 a mere fraction of that 100 million we could put organizers in key states around the country and give them the tools to work with for several months
7519859 we need an earned media effort that helps us reframe the war in a cross cutting way that moves a substantial number of americans to take the view that the war is wrong and connect it to a solution namely to safely quickly and completely end the war starting january 21 2009
7519860 the colours of these nimbus beauties ranged from featherly light whites to raging scarlet reds and gave the audience that
7519861 i think ill have my staff get back to you
7519862 i guess if you think that being rich means that youve got to make 5 million and if you dont know how many houses you have then its not surprising that you might think the economy was fundamentally strong
7519863 but if youre like me and youve got one house or if you were like the millions of people who are struggling right now to keep up with their mortgage so they dont lose their home you might have a different perspective
7519864 by the way the answer is john mccain has seven homes
7519865 he couldnt count high enough apparently to know how many houses he owns
7519866 does a guy who made more than 4 million last year just got back from vacation on a private beach in hawaii and bought his own million dollar mansion with the help of a convicted felon really want to get into a debate about houses
7519867 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7519868 these have been great games but china does have to turn back to addressing its own human rights issues things beyond the scope of the olympics
7519869 if you have a sample from a brother or a father it is easy but if we get away from this and have to turn to more distant relatives things are much much more complicated

7519877 youll have a sense of who she is and what our values are and how were raising our kids
7519878 and i think what youll conclude is hes sort of like us he comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care they had to figure out how to start a college fund for their kids
7519879 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket
7519880 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the democratic party
7519881 has a high regard for sen clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration he felt that sen biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7519882 hillary clintons support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7519883 what it really shows is barack obama has the confidence and the judgment to pick someone who is really experienced and is willing to speak their minds

7519889 recentissimi ed autorevoli studi che hanno rielaborato i rapporti dellocse pisa ci dicono che le difficolt che si riscontrano nelle scuole del mezzogiorno derivano da problemi connessi alledilizia scolastica e alla mancanza di laboratori nonch allo scarso sviluppo economico e al divario fra le attese delle famiglie e il territorio stesso questioni che chiamano in campo direttamente la responsabilit del governo e del ministero e che richiedono investimenti ed interventi conseguenti
7519890 vanno in tuttaltra direzione ma adesso con una riscoperta di unanalisi lombrosiana si vorrebbe scaricare la responsabilit di questa situazione ad una presunta scarsa preparazione degli insegnanti del mezzogiorno che non solo non esiste e non mai stata documentata in alcuna analisi degna di questo nome perch la realt ci dice esattamente il contrario ma vive solo in un approccio ai temi della scuola italiana di chiaro stampo leghista che oggigiorno preoccupa di pi anche per gli aspetti di deterioramento nelle relazioni sociali che in grado di produrre

7519921 you need to punish him if he bowls a bad ball if you continue to defend him he will always be on top
7519922 i am pleased with the way the two spinners bowled they went for 50 runs but lot of guys do go for that kind of scores these days these are two exceptional spinners and i am sure they well come back strongly
7519923 hes had a fantastic start hes gone out there wanting the captaincy and already hes making really good decisions hopefully he will go from strength to strength hes learning all the time
7519924 the team definitely strengthens with colly coming back in he will bat at six bowl his medium pace and field at backward point and he has 150 games of one day international experience so to have him back with the ability he has got and that kind of experience is an extra boost
7519925 he was only operating at about 50 per cent of his capacity so we will have to step him up quite a bit if he is to make tuesdays second match

7519942 many of their systems are nearly obsolete such as the boilers they use to generate steam for main propulsion as you might expect its becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain these ships spare parts are no longer readily available and the skills needed to operate and maintain systems that were already mature in the 1960s are becoming increasingly rare

7519961 sports is one of the most popular interests in the school this can be seen by the fact that the athletes needs are met through designing special programs consideration of their needs consideration of their teachers competitions and placing the school athletics program high on our list of priorities
7519962 sports is as popular a subject as communications and electronics but sports raise school pride while other areas of study do not
7519963 they are cognizant of their own needs but not the needs of others its not a good part of their character or their personality the contempt for others their condescending behavior and their feeling of superiority
7519964 for young athletes those that are active in sports leagues and primarily those that represent their school there are unique needs that require special handling given that the focus on athletic achievements and the pride they bring the school could harm other educational values that students should be taught

7519978 we will take some guidance from the player himself on whether hes mentally ready but i think hes been in the game long enough to know he would only go out there if he was confident he could be an effective player
7519979 i have a lot of faith in richard to make the right decision
7519980 motus a bit of a struggle at the moment hes got a recurrence of his knee injury
7519981 its going to be tough for motu to get onto the training park this week
7519982 we will make a decision on adam later in the week he has played only in fits and starts which has been the case for him all year
7519983 it is important we do our best to get him out there at the weekend he is crucial he is a scrum half an organiser he plays a massively important role and we want to do our utmost to make sure he is out there

7519985 i had a few options but i chose sunderland because of the manager the club has big ambitions and really good players
7519986 i feel like i have a point to prove because i think i can do really well in the premier league and show people i can score goals in this division
7519987 the way i play my game i think i am made for england
7519988 el hadji called me he had a few words with me and said the ambition at the club is good so i said good
7519989 its a good lively forward line with me and el hadji and dont forget about kenwyne jones as well and plenty of other players who are quality
7519990 nobody expects sunderland to be a good team but i know the boys now and we want to show people that we are a good club and that we can go and do well
7519991 we can surprise a lot of teams like we did against tottenham
7519992 it was a surprise for me to score on my debut and i was very happy for the guys for the manager and for the people who support me
7519993 but i think we deserved the win we played well we always tried to play football and we fought against tottenham who are a good team
