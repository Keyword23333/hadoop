7200000 looking back we had our chances we just needed to be a little more consistent in our play we werent always as intense as we probably needed to be and i think well learn from that
7200001 we have some real proven leadership returning this season and that makes me more comfortable as a coach that kind of leadership will help us get through the ups and downs of the season
7200002 our defense during practice is as tough as any team we play against
7200003 they are just so solid we know we are going be in games because of that group
7200004 what we need to do is find a way to score more goals if our offense can find a way to do that well be in good shape
7200005 a lot of our attack will be determined by her performance and shes looked great in practice
7200006 we have to play better in the big games this season
7200007 our schedule is tougher this season and i think just the experience of playing in those games last season and talking about them is going to help this is going to be our most challenging season but what that does is give us more opportunity to have those big games
7200008 it was a great freshman year but i had a lot of help my teammates created the chances i was just able to put them away
7200009 we dont talk about getting to postseason as much as we talk about playing our best soccer every day and continuing to improve throughout the whole year
7200010 we brought back a lot of players and have some really good freshman coming in i think were at a point where we should be the no 1 team in the conference i think it would be a letdown if we werent
7200011 we have 10 starters back but that doesnt mean theyve nailed down those starting spots this season
7200012 theres a lot of competition for playing time on this team i think some of these players are going to have to get used to not playing a full 90 minutes because we have so many players who could step in there this is as deep a team as any that has been here
7200013 i knew we had a great team when i first came up here
7200014 there was always a lot of talent on this team the challenge was just putting everything together and last year we figured that out
7200015 but montana state billings and spu will both be tough still i think we have to be the favorites
7200016 its amazing how thin that line is between two wins and 14 wins we really werent that far off and its the same with this team they could either continue to excel do great and go all the way or they could go the other direction we dont talk about our expectation as getting to the tournament we just try to get as good as we can each day
7200017 he is one of the few artists that gets it
7200018 there was a little situation that came about and i went through the ringer
7200019 the test came back negative hence the song dat baby dont look like me i just took it and put a little spin on it

7200027 you know after bernice died i was real sad she was the center of my universe and well its been really hard so i went and started going to see a counselor do you know that this counselor is really a lovely woman and the only thing she wants to know about is me she hasnt got an agenda she just wants to know about me so we talk for the hour or so and she gives me the gift of unconditional acceptance when i start to get real self critical she wont accept it but helps me see that i can accept myself too shes given me a real beautiful gift i hope you will give that to people you know all they need is someone to want to know them and then you know people just bam blossom they just become its the best medicine ever you could give someone

7200030 you cant change america and give our workers a fighting chance when after 3 million manufacturing jobs disappear you continue to support tax breaks for companies who ship our jobs overseas
7200031 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare that no one has supported bush in iraq more than i have you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7200032 we dont have to have four more years of george w bush and john mccain
7200033 the next us president is going to deliver the most significant moment in american history since franklin roosevelt he will have such an incredible opportunity not only to change the direction of america but literally to change the direction of the world
7200034 this is no ordinary election and this may be our last chance to reclaim the america we love america gave jill and me our chance it gave barack and michelle their chance to stand on this stage today it s the time for all of us as lincoln said to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm
7200035 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesn t have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong joe won t just make a good vice president he will make a great one

7200039 non viewers perceive television to have power they believe it can steal time can affect consumer behavior and can influence how autonomous children are
7200040 based on the interviews the surveys and the time use diaries it appears that those who do not watch television not only reject television in order to keep sex violence shallow news coverage and consumerism out of their lives but also to encourage family interaction their childrens independence and creativity and a wise use of their time
7200041 every strong opinions not only about television but also about those issues they saw as being associated with it such as politics and couple interaction

7200047 there are two directions you can go with this research some might say this suggests that parents should have their kids attend places of worship
7200048 or if we use it to help explain why religious participation has a positive effect on academics parents who aren t interested in attending church can consider how to structure their kids time to allow access to the same beneficial social networks and opportunities religious institutions provide

7200050 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7200051 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7200052 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7200053 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7200054 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7200055 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7200056 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7200057 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7200058 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7200059 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7200060 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7200061 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7200062 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7200063 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7200064 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7200065 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7200066 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7200067 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7200068 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7200069 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7200070 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7200071 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7200072 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7200073 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7200074 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7200075 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7200076 its nice that you can get a twofer with one of the heaviest hitters on foreign policy in the senate and also get someone who has the capacity to reach these lunch bucket voters

7200080 most of those who are disappointed that hillary clinton was chosen will readily concede that joe biden is a solid choice and highly qualified avoiding some of the hard feelings that might have occurred if some of the lesser experienced contenders had been selected
7200081 if its a referendum on obama then the question is much less about how bad bush and mccain are and about how good really is obama
7200082 and thats where the doubts that the republicans have tried to create begin to seep in
7200083 an attractive intelligent man interesting hard to categorize is he gen obama no no military background brilliant businessman obama no he never worked in business famous name obama no its a new name an unusual one longtime southern governor obama no hes a community organizer whats that then a lawyer boo then a state legislator so what sos my cousin then u s senator less than four years
7200084 theyre stirring up a little hate and discontent with that deal
7200085 its like putting up a barrier weve all intermingled for years
7200086 it was freer before but we live in a different world now
7200087 weve gotten more aircraft more vehicles more boats more atvs pretty much everything weve got more and weve got more people to man them
7200088 this may have been mayberry before but its not anymore
7200089 i have one brother hes american he was born on the u s side i was born on the canadian side
7200090 it was like there was no border people back and forth
7200091 im always over here chatting with the girls this is the best pharmacy in the world
7200092 i went to church on the other side i taught sunday school there i live on one of those unguarded streets i used to cross the border all the time
7200093 it hasnt been an easy issue for either side to digest
7200094 but we understand that border patrol and homeland security have a job to do the general public doesnt understand whats crossing that border whether its drugs or illegals
7200095 they understand that theres a change but to them its a way of life
7200096 they never considered themselves in danger theres a sense of security here
7200097 if a kid on the canada side throws a frisbee over here he can come and get it but if he got the frisbee and kept walking down to the arbys to get a soda were going to stop you
7200098 if were wrong once that could be devastating to the whole country
7200099 theres a lot of violence on the southern border so some of thats going to transfer up here
7200100 to protect this area its enormous its huge its wide open youve got to know what youre doing to be an agent up here
7200101 theres a delineated line with mexico here if you were to walk around this town you would probably walk into canada and not even know it
7200102 so they understand were not doing this stuff because of them were doing it to protect them

7200106 i am constantly amazed at how the christian conspiracy cabal dismisses condemns and ridicules those who explore the illusory nature of reality when the christian story demands that its advocates suspend all incredulity if they are to believe what it says
7200107 the conspiracy field is full of sheep who have left one shepherd and found themselves another it is full of repeaters who just repeat what someone else has said the same as with mainstream journalists and the masses who allow the television to tell them what to think they have not woken up looked themselves in the eye and started to break the chains of programming and robotic reaction that bind them to the systems will they just transfer those programs to a new subject in this case conspiracy research so if they were ego maniacs before they woke up they ply their new trade from the perspective of an ego maniac if they were arrogant and abusive before they simply transfer that to conspiracy research if their perspective had been self indulgent me me me then nothing is going to change that unless they do and thus truly wake up
7200108 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery

7200115 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7200116 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7200117 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7200118 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7200119 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7200120 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7200121 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7200122 who are open to doing something on the production side
7200123 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7200124 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7200125 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7200126 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7200127 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7200128 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7200129 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7200130 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7200131 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7200132 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7200133 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7200134 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7200135 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7200136 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7200137 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7200138 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7200139 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis

7200145 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7200146 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7200147 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7200148 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7200149 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7200150 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7200151 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7200152 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7200153 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7200154 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7200155 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7200156 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7200157 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7200158 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7200159 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7200160 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7200161 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7200162 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7200163 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7200164 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7200165 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7200166 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7200167 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

7200188 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7200189 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7200190 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down
7200191 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7200192 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7200193 from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7200194 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so

7200210 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision

7200241 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7200242 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7200243 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7200244 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7200245 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7200246 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7200247 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7200248 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7200249 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7200250 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7200251 try to use that word or those words more often
7200252 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7200253 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7200254 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7200255 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7200256 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7200257 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7200258 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7200259 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7200260 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7200261 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7200262 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result

7200278 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7200279 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7200280 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7200281 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7200282 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7200283 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7200284 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7200285 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7200286 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7200287 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7200288 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7200289 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7200290 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them

7200295 we know where the students are and were able to accurately forecast where theyre going to be
7200296 you make your best guess at first based on the projections things are very dynamic
7200297 we take that information then and we listen to the principals in terms of some of the things theyre expecting we look at projections and try to determine the best we can some of the baseline staffing we can expect
7200298 as we look at class sizes weve been able to maintain excellent class sizes throughout the district
7200299 the way it affects us is we look at our enrollment on the first day of school and if we see our classes are too big we add another teacher
7200300 kids are resilient teachers are competent and they get right in there and get the job done
7200301 its a testament of how well these teachers are prepared and make it happen no matter what it takes
7200302 you know its a tense situation as an administrator you know its a tense situation for parents
7200303 i think you will be quite pleased when you see what we are planning for the next tour we have been working on the idea for two years already

7200308 they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7200309 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7200310 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners chatters his very tires is what he did i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny hamlin got to his outside and he got by me and then i had to battle with him towards the end we were as clean as could be of course but just one other dude we had a problem with
7200311 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was really mad
7200312 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7200313 earlier this year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7200314 so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made and id do it again
7200315 i think we ought to just build it over them and let them stop us
7200316 thats what we call the next couple of days the lanai 500 i gather we just sail in circles around lanai and practice various stuff they are going to be dropping a buoy and start doing practicing docking at 8am tomorrow morning
7200317 to stay in the game asean must become a strong integrated region
7200318 what we are seeing is that asean is at the focal point of all these trade agreements
7200319 eventually when you consolidate the ftas it is possible that you could end up with something like that an asia wide fta
7200320 substantial gains could be realised from consolidating the many ftas into a single region wide one
7200321 governments need to connect the poor to the thriving regional economy by eliminating labour market barriers investing in workers capabilities and building infrastructure to connect disadvantaged regions with economic centres
7200322 we are witnessing the beginnings of a strong prosperous outward looking asian economic community regionally integrated yet connected with global markets and with responsibility and influence to match its economic weight

7200330 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7200331 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7200332 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7200333 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7200334 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7200335 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7200336 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7200337 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7200338 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
7200339 it was really amazing there were kids swimming out to see us and boats sailing out to meet us
7200340 it took us a day and a half to get here and most of the activists got seasick but the people here were so happy when we arrived
7200341 they came they were welcomed but what will they do tomorrow they were hoping for a long confrontation with israel now they wont have it
7200342 now that weve come through whats the excuse to keep the third boat out or the 10th boat or the 100th we did break the economic siege of gaza
7200343 curfew is in force please dont come out of your homes
7200344 the curfew has been imposed to pre empt the rally

7200348 the obama desire to get out and the mccain desire to succeed could be coming together in the form of an ability to get out while succeeding
7200349 the simple truth is that we do not have sufficient forces in iraq to meet our military objectives
7200350 facts have to affect your decision making and over the course of 16 months things are going to constantly change
7200351 he values withdrawal from iraq above victory in iraq even today with victory in sight
7200352 killed more than 130 apostates wounded more than 100 and destroyed three barracks and several vehicles
7200353 do i want to worry about how life makes me feel
7200354 how can i feed my family how can i give my children a future
7200355 thats what i am asking god every day every single day
7200356 the restaurant is just down the street from the police post that was blown up
7200357 his office is across from the courthouse you know the one where that attack happened
7200358 sometimes people look like they want to cry when they are paying for their groceries
7200359 they are searching their handbags and their pockets for every single coin i look away when this happens
7200360 my schoolwork is affected because it is too hot and too dark to study inside my home
7200361 i sit out on the roof until the light fades too much for me to read anymore i want to become educated and better myself but it is very hard
7200362 unless the government appears to the outside world to be competent and stable which it most certainly does not at the moment foreign investment wont be coming back and economic recovery will be very difficult
7200363 and a bad economy generates support for the insurgency even in pakistan where people on the whole really do not want to be ruled by islamists
7200364 but the extremists are seen as the main alternative to the government so in bad times people turn to them
7200365 this has reinforced the very cynical feeling pakistanis have had for many years about the relationship with the united states theyll use you and then theyll ditch you
7200366 one to america one to canada two more to the u k
7200367 it is worth what it has been worth since 1949 thats my short answer
7200368 terrorism radicalisation climate change energy these are the biggest security threats nowadays and they are not something nato can do much about it doesnt have an answer
7200369 for the last five years we have been increasingly focused on being an expeditionary force in afghanistan
7200370 now we have to struggle with the return of the classical nato challenge in georgia and were going to have to manage to do both
7200371 the era of russian weakness is over were now in a much more competitive relationship with russia and georgia has put european security back on the geopolitical map also for the us all that could mean a rejuvenation of nato
7200372 if we said no to the americans theres a danger the transatlantic alliance could unravel and the americans could leave europe we think that would be a disaster
7200373 but for the dutch or the portuguese nato is also about looking to the americans to keep the big european powers in check
7200374 russia misread that decision and saw it as a lack of resolve on natos part
7200375 moscow is well aware that few nato members want to extend a mutual security guarantee to a country at war with europes biggest neighbour
7200376 the main question is are you willing to go to war for tbilisi i think the answer is no
7200377 i just want to say how i think the other contestants are all so beautiful in their own right but i want to thank god for making me more beautiful xoxo
7200378 did you ever think that youd end up doing what youre doing now or is this what youve always wanted

7200386 most of us respond to rising demands in the workplace by putting in longer hours which inevitably take a toll on us physically mentally and emotionally that leads to declining levels of engagement increasing levels of distraction high turn over rates and soaring medical costs among employees

7200390 in den vergangenen 18 monaten habe ich gesehen wie barack die herausforderungen des pr sidentschaftswahlkampfs mit urteilsf higkeit klugheit und r ckrat gemeistert hat
7200391 und w hrend dieser 18 monate war ich sehr entt uscht von meinem freund john mccain der vor dem rechten fl gel seiner partei eingenickt ist
7200392 erzogen von einer allein erziehenden mutter musste er f r foodstamps anstehen als die stahlh tten dicht machten ging er in chicagos south side um den menschen dort eine stimme zu geben
7200393 barack und ich kommen von ganz anderen orten aber wir teilen den amerikanischen traum kein hindernis ist gro genug wenn du nur bereit bist hart zu k mpfen
7200394 es geht nicht darum wie oft du k o geschlagen wirst sondern darum wie oft du wieder aufstehst
7200395 is the key concept of ken blanchard situational leadership model in other words a manager needs to adapt his leadership style to his co workers depending on their level of committment and their level of competence
7200396 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7200397 how many of us will be ignored by friends and family because weve killed someone in cold blood on command
7200398 pseudonyms protect the bloggers and their relatives from terrorist attacks for example
7200399 a molehill quickly turns into a mountain and the content of blogs can quickly turn into a match ball for domestic politics
7200400 bloggers only have their personal views and often distribute half truths
7200401 its not so easy to set the boundaries for sport performance there are certainly absolute boundaries that we cannot surpass an athlete can certainly not complete a 100 meter run within 9 or 8 seconds regardless of how much we develop further let s say at least within the next 100 years
7200402 the overall results with slight increases in performance will approach an absolute boundary that we cannot specify for certain and that we cannot express in numbers
7200403 in that case we first looked at a study to ascertain which muscles are important in a wrestling dive and the athlete was also with us when the athlete got injured he had to be operated on both shoulders afterwards we could look at the results and say which muscles needed to be built up appropriately we could then give the rehabilitation experts optimal recommendations
7200404 first we had the cash for vote scam and now land for job these incidents signify the height of corruption
7200405 more load would make the vehicle unstable and cause mishaps
7200406 we have to see what are the amendments proposed we can talk only after that but we will not accept any prescriptive amendment
7200407 they told us they would hold a medical camp and thats where all the people got affected they asked us to come the next week for a follow up now theyre not responding to us to giving any compensation
7200408 there are inputs that they separatist leaders could be targeted so as a precautionary measure curfew has been imposed and people have been asked to maintain peace and calm
7200409 as of now we have decided to go ahead with mondays march to lal chowk

7200420 hab a muchas acrobacias peligrosas y al principio me lat a demasiado fuerte el coraz n
7200421 es verdad que lo hab amos trabajado mucho pero hab a elementos que pod an entra ar un mal desenlace el puente era lo que m s me preocupaba porque si el puente no llegaba a ser puente el fallo habr a sido espectacular las otras tres acrobacias se pod an salvar pero un fallo en el puente habr a acarreado una penalizaci n demasiado grave como para permanecer en el podio
7200422 la sensaci n que me queda es de trabajo bien hecho de recompensa por una buena puntuaci n y sobre todo de confianza porque estas medallas confirman que hemos establecido una l nea de pensamiento y de trabajo todo el trabajo que se ha hecho con las chicas ha dado su resultado
7200423 creo que el ejercicio que han hecho las rusas no es el m s emocionante pero s es verdad que el elemento t cnico es de 10
7200424 a nivel art stico hay que reconocer que el primer salto de las rusas ha sido un metro y medio m s alto que el nuestro y nosotros hemos tenido un desajuste en una acrobacia con paola tirados a no ser que las rusas fallaran lo que nos tocar a a nosotras era esa plata eso ya lo sab amos

7200662 di aku punya tebakan kalau kamu bisa jawab kamu minta apa aja aku beliin
7200663 gimana caranya keluarin orang didalam kamar yang tidak ada pintunya dan tanpa bantuan alat apapun
7200664 wah kalo itu sih sulit gimana bisa panjat atau bongkar tuh tembok kalo gak ada alatnya terus apa dong solusinya
7200665 bodo banget sih kamu ya tinggal keluar aja wong kamarnya tidak ada pintunya
7200666 no signs of female seeking or showing any eagerness to look for a male companion for mating
7200667 its already been two months since they were first released here as there are no signs so far of tigress looking for male as usually is the case in the species it might be possible that she is already pregnant and is ready to produce off springs
7200668 she was already in her mature stage for mating when she was picked from her earlier home in ranthambore so our guess that she is pregnant might be true
7200669 the separatists lied to the whole country to the whole world saying that hindu colonalisation will come up in the valley the separatists lied to the world saying there is an economic blockade
7200670 there was nobody in the valley not even the state government or the central government which countered that propoganda
7200671 we are the ones who are saying that the land transfer is pursuant to a direction of the high court and why it should be implemented
7200672 any stoppage of traffic because of protest is not a blockade
7200673 we are prepared for this and we are expecting a formal announcement at the teleconference
7200674 the economy is heading towards a meltdown there is no way pakistan can win this prolonged war against militants and this government is the most incompetent in our history
7200675 in these circumstances this government is not going to last long for the next six months i would predict you should hang on to your seatbelt there is going to be a lot of turbulence ahead
7200676 if the government persists with a very unpopular american policy of fighting terrorism there could be anarchy and destabilisation under musharraf it was heading towards civil war and with zardari i think the deterioration could happen more quickly
7200677 we are keeping a close watch since the incident took place
7200678 if production is not increased there may be problems as milk consumption in india is growing due to rising income of the population
7200679 i dont think that we were just going through the motions before
7200680 i mean we were losing tough games and yesterdays was the first one where we just got blown out
7200681 tonight we got up early and got the focus back were not going to be too hard on ourselves if we lose a few tough games but theres nobody in here whos going out there not caring if we win or lose
7200682 that was supposed to be a sac fly he just misplayed it
7200683 thats an out in any mans game most guys catch that ball
7200684 teixeiras just absolutely killing everything we throw and hes on every pitch
7200685 you look at the stats and they say vladdy hits into some double plays so youve got to take a chance but thats pick your poison right there i would bet you wouldnt want to do that too many times a year walk anybody to get to vladdy
7200686 in the past id gotten a couple of hits off his offspeed pitches but tonight i noticed that his fastball was working really well so i was just looking for something hard the entire at bat
7200687 i didnt even think about thursday at all i just went out and played my game
7200688 maybe once or twice a year i have a little fluke like that im human and that kind of humbles me a little bit today i felt rejuvenated and ready to go
7200689 i think a day out of the outfield yesterday as the dh kind of helped me a little bit and i was able to run today
7200690 i didnt have any hits so i made sure nobody else wound have any
7200691 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7200692 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7200693 collective security means arranging to blame one another for inaction so that everyone has an excuse it does not mean standing together it means hiding together
7200694 its a mad mad mad world for some of his best film work he was one of the key characters in a movie that had at least 50 well known comedians in it
7200695 look we have to be able to laugh at each other nobody can be above mockery we cant be pc here everybody should be able to laugh at themselves
7200696 i havent seen anyone run that fast since willis ran away from mr drummond after finding out he was adopted in the 12th episode of different strokes
7200697 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7200698 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said
7200699 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7200700 this proposal should never have been given serious consideration greenpeace climate campaigner john hepburn said
7200701 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland mr hepburn said
7200702 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change
7200703 i dont envy ms bligh given the economic power of the greenhouse mafia but sometime soon she is going to have to make the tough decision to put the future of the state ahead of the vested interests of the coal lobby
7200704 in five minutes just a minute shush tell the boy to do it

7200713 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification
7200714 i took only a foot and some of a torso i could not get the other bodies out
7200715 i have nothing my neighbors feed me if they have food to share
7200716 they have the cis flag and that flag is not our georgian flag
7200717 georgia is not a member of this organization so the troops must leave very quickly
7200718 poti is not in the security zone but that doesnt mean that we will sit behind the fence and watch as they drive around in hummers

7200741 in terms of whos an elitist i think people have made a judgment that john mccain is not an arugula eating pointy headed professor type based on his life story
7200742 okay i really try to keep the politics out but now theyre smearing

7200745 many people say we are short of talent on the uneven bars or that we lag behind the americans but thats not true
7200746 i cant wait to go out and prove them wrong
7200747 the high score i had this time surprised me too but i am not thinking about keeping it at the games i want to get an even higher score to beat all my rivals in august
7200748 he not only brings china another chance for a gold medal she shows the world we are an all around team that is able to compete against the best teams in the world
7200749 she is the best athlete on uneven bars that i have seen in 20 years the talent is here now what we need to do is tell her how to manage it
7200750 she is definitely the most dangerous gymnast in the world but i am confident i can keep her away from the gold medal as long as i can perform at my highest level
7200751 i am sure chinese gymnasts will come back and win back our glories
7200752 the wins at the world championships and recent world cups have given us more experience and determination
7200753 some of the worlds best athletes did not come while most of them in tianjin were not competitive enough
7200754 americans worry about their shrinking incomes thats not a worry mccain has to worry about he has to think about which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at

7200790 it is a huge honour to be carrying the flag at the closing ceremony
7200791 when you consider the standard of the team it is a very special honour for me
7200792 the british team is ready and thats important because we want a powerful and successful home team to foster the enthusiasm of the whole population
7200793 that has been achieved four years beforehand and they will be able to improve even on that
7200794 its clear that china has put the bar very high and its going to be a challenge for london and also for all the subsequent games
7200795 i believe and i hope that london can put the bar even higher so that we have consistent improvement and evolution of the olympic games
7200796 london has unique assets athens was returning to the roots to the country that invented the olympic games china was the most populous country in the world
7200797 london is the capital city of the country that has invented modern sport that has invented the rules of the sports and the values of fair play
7200798 it is a cosmopolitan multi ethnic and multi religious city and thats something they can build on
7200799 new voter registration process in danger of being a paper chase
7200800 especially with the euro being so strong and the u s dollar being so weak i think a lot of younger people who had initially avoided them are staying there because they are hearing so many great things about them and money is tight
7200801 its not only youths filling up the hostel anymore like in the 70s
7200802 are more expensive but also provide more privacy and luxury
7200803 they can be surprisingly expensive for the quality so i suppose the image of the cheap backpackers hostel is rapidly disappearing
7200804 they talk about the price but it doesnt prevent them from coming here and traveling
7200805 we chose hostels because i think we wanted a more authentic backpacking experience
7200806 for the time we were in italy we stayed in budget hotels and by the end of it we were excited to get back to staying in larger rooms with more people
7200807 i just turned 50 and i promised myself that as a present to me i would do something i had never done before

7200811 i know im getting old for some of this stuff
7200812 but its still fun and i like to keep busy
7200813 i raised a few teens myself so i know we have to keep them interested without turning them off with stupid stuff you just have to offer them choices
7200814 i want to own my own bed and breakfast some day and watching the tesches make this a success is something let me tell you
7200815 every time i come here its so hard to leave
7200816 the first time it was with my mom and she was bringing a girlfriend who broke her leg so my mom called at the last minute and said hey can you fill in it was the best time id ever had so every time i leave i just have to figure out a way to get back here again
7200817 so thats not even the main draw the scenery is spectacular and there is so much to do were never bored even after coming here so many times
7200818 we never thought way back when when we were fixing up the barn that fly fishing could possibly turn out to be the bigger draw one day
7200819 you get exercise you get to relax and they make you feel like family

7200840 susan bayh is well compensated for her work in fact it is estimated that the bayhs net worth is somewhere in the range of 2 9 million and 6 4 million it is also estimated that 57 of their holdings are from investments in the health services industry and 7 from the pharmaceutical health products industry
7200841 on january 31 2006 senator bayh and senator jeff bingaman d nm announced plans to introduce the medicare prescription emergency guarantee act to guarantee prescriptions to seniors who may or may not qualify for the prescription drug plan
7200842 on february 2 2006 congress passed the senator bayh sponsored long term care legislation that would make long term medical care insurance available to more patients
7200843 on may 17 2007 two weeks before it was announced that wellpoints mega cfo was stepping down for unspecified non work related issues mrs bayh exercised options on 3 334 shares of wellpoint
7200844 according to sec records the pre tax profit on the sale of wellpoint stock from february 2006 to the present was approximately 1 045 million
7200845 mrs bayh also served on the boards of directors of cubist pharmaceuticals inc a pharmaceutical company from 2000 to 2004 she left just before cubist senior management family members and a neighbor were all implicated in an sec insider trading lawsuit in january 2005

7200848 while there is no conclusive evidence to show that susan bayh in any way influences the decisions of her the senator on policy matters there is compelling evidence to show that the bayh family has profited greatly from its relationship with wellpoint

7200850 much like gary hart hes identified more with the partys presidential past than its present or future said political scientist larry sabato a professor at the university of virginia
7200851 in 1987 biden quit the democratic primary race early after the revelation that he had delivered without attribution passages from a speech by british labor party leader neil kinnock a barrage of subsidiary revelations by the press also hammered bidens image a serious plagiarism incident from his law school years boastful exaggerations of his academic record at a new hampshire campaign event and the discovery of other quotations in bidens speeches pilfered from past democratic politicians
7200852 in the post clinton era plagiarism may seem like small potatoes but sabato explains the key to a scandal is how it counters or in the case of biden reinforces his public image
7200853 the reason it became such an issue was that it reinforced the biden image that already existed among the press that hes a blowhard a guy who talked before he thought sabato says
7200854 in february 1988 biden was hospitalized for two brain aneurysms which kept him from the senate for seven months
7200855 senator joseph r biden jr underwent surgery today to correct an aneurysm in an artery that supplies blood to the right side of the brain a spokesman for the walter reed army medical center said the spokesman peter esker said senator biden was awake resting comfortably and talking with his family after the operation his second this year to correct an aneurysm an aneurysm is a ballooning of an artery
7200856 the 4 1 2 hour procedure was similar to that performed feb 12 on the left side of mr bidens brain under the procedure a surgeon using a microscope pinches the aneurysm with a clip bringing the walls of the artery together the clip remains in the patient
7200857 mr esker said there are no signs of any other aneurysms adding that the second was much smaller than the first the senator is awake and alert oriented moving all extremities well and is conversing with his family mr esker said he is expected to be hospitalized about 10 days and then would go home to recuperate senator biden a 45 year old delaware democrat is chairman of the judiciary committee

7200874 a former marine sergeant facing the first federal civilian prosecution of a military member accused of a war crime says there is much more at stake than his claim of innocence on charges that he killed unarmed detainees in fallujah iraq

7200876 the case came to light in 2006 when nazarios former squadmate sgt ryan weemer volunteered details to a u s secret service job interviewer during a lie detector screening that included a question about the most serious crime he ever committed
7200877 after leaving the military nazario worked as an officer with the riverside police department and was close to completing his one year probation he said he knew nothing of the investigation until he was arrested aug 7 2007 after being called into the watch commanders office to sign a performance review
7200878 he said he was leaning forward to sign when he was grabbed from behind by his fellow officers told he had been charged with a war crime and was turned over to navy investigators waiting in a nearby room
7200879 because he had not completed probation the police department fired him since then he said has been unable to find work

7200888 obama blinked and stands guilty of appeasing clinton by agreeing to a roll call vote for her nomination that he might not have had much choice if he wanted peace only proves the point that hes playing defense at his own convention
7200889 what does he get out of it not much and not for long
7200890 the fleeting sense that he is a magnanimous nominee wont get him a single vote he wouldnt get anyway ditto for the idea that hes going the extra mile to unify the party those who refuse to accept him as the legitimate winner arent likely to do so just because he caves into her demands

7200900 what did they know and when did they know it
7200901 it is fashionable for regulators to say that they were taken by surprise and were unaware of how deep the violation of sound banking practices ran
7200902 unfortunately the fdic appears to be complicit in the sale of subprime loans with all of their warts and wrinkles including falsified data and pushed appraisals
7200903 according to a story in the july 21st version of the wall street journals online edition the unusual situation which is still bedeviling bank regulators stems from the 2001 seizure by federal officials of superior bank fsb then a national subprime lender based in hinsdale ill
7200904 with fdic people supervising day to day operations superior funded more than 6 700 new subprime loans worth more than 550 million according to federal mortgage data
7200905 the fdic then sold a big chunk of the loans to another bank that loan pool was afflicted by the same problems for which regulators have faulted the industry lending to unqualified borrowers inflated appraisals and poor verification of borrowers incomes according to a written report from a government hired expert the report said that many of the loans never should have been made in the first place
7200906 bottom line hundreds of borrowers who took out superior subprime loans on the fdics watch some with initial interest rates higher than 12 have lost their homes to foreclosure data on the loans indicate

7200997 the tribune discourages the use of unnamed sources according to the newspapers stylebook with exceptions made to protect the safety of a source or other extenuating circumstances
7200998 there are plenty of good reasons of course that reporters are willing to trade the truth in exchange for not naming the source of the information some sources may fear criticism others face retaliation and even physical danger for speaking out anonymity is a shield to protect them
7200999 the tribune will not print anonymously sourced material that adds only supplemental or trivial material to stories such as a zippy but unattributed quote that might enliven a prosaic narrative but that also might lead the reader to wonder about the validity of the material

7201005 the moderation in growth would be on account of issues like tight monetary policy and some global factors including rising prices of oil and commodities
7201006 the long term growth story remains intact and 2010 11 will see resurgence in growth
7201007 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7201008 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time
7201009 the idea as in bosnia is to maintain a united iraq by decentralizing it giving each ethno religious group kurd sunni arab and shiite arab room to run its own affairs
7201010 the kurdish sunni and shiite regions would each be responsible for their own domestic laws administration and internal security the central government would control border defense foreign affairs and oil revenues
7201011 the original biden plan seems less relevant in iraq today than at any point
7201012 the trend in parliament is clearly in a more national direction with political parties coming together across sectarian divides
7201013 in other words there is a very strong iraqi mobilization against precisely the core elements of the biden plan and it would be extremely unwise of the democratic party to make bidens ideas the centerpiece of their iraq strategy
7201014 we dont support establishing federal regions on a sectarian basis for example our region is not ethnic it contains kurds and non kurds the regions should be established on a geographic basis

7201055 i am sure as sure as i can be of anything that is as sure as you can read any other mans state of mind the thing that prompted dick to want to do this thing and prompted me to want to do this thing was a sort of pure love of excitement or the imaginary love of thrills doing something different possibly the satisfaction and the ego of putting something over the money consideration only came in afterwards and never was important the getting of the money was a part of our objective as was also the commission of the crime but that was not the exact motive
7201056 they should commit a perfect crime a crime so intricate and complicated that planning and calculating its flawless execution would be a challenge they should kidnap a child he proposed and to increase the intricacy of the crime they should demand a ransom from the childs parents the money was important not for its own sake but to magnify the complexity of the crime it was to be a brilliant crime he mused one that would shock chicago with its daring they would obtain the ransom dispose of the body and leave no clues behind the police would never catch them

7201062 the criminal did not freely choose wrongdoing rather factors outside his or her conscious control acted to determine criminal behavior there was no such thing as individual responsibility imprisonment was futile and even counterproductive it served no purpose either as a deterrent or as a punishment
7201063 the trial of nathan leopold and richard loeb would be a contest between two charismatic individuals darrow who had built his reputation by defending unpopular causes and crowe the most competent and energetic states attorney in a generation and there would be a second contest a contest between opposing philosophies of crime and punishment which one would triumph
7201064 the statute provides that evidence may be offered in mitigation of the punishment and we shall ask at such time as the court may direct that we may be permitted to offer evidence as to the mental condition of these young men to show the degree of responsibility they had and also to offer evidence as to the youth of these defendants and the fact of a plea of guilty as further mitigation of the penalties in this case
7201065 needed only to persuade the judge that they were mentally ill a medical condition not at all equivalent or comparable to insanity to obtain a reduction in their sentence and darrow needed only one reduction from death by hanging to life in prison to win his case
7201066 the court is moved chiefly by the consideration of the age of the defendants
7201067 life imprisonment may not at the moment strike the public imagination as forcibly as would death by hanging but to the offenders particularly of the type they are the prolonged suffering of years of confinement may well be the severer form of retribution and expiation

7201073 bin laden was though a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies
7201074 the truth is there is no islamic army or terrorist group called al qaida and any informed intelligence officer knows this but there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an identified entity representing the devil only in order to drive the tv watcher to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism the country behind this propaganda is the us and the lobbyists for the us war on terrorism are only interested in making money

7201100 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7201101 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7201102 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7201103 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7201104 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7201105 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7201106 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7201107 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7201108 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7201109 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7201110 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7201111 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7201112 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7201113 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7201114 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7201115 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7201116 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7201117 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7201118 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7201119 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7201120 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7201121 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7201122 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7201123 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7201124 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself

7201126 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing

7201130 the chinese gymnastics association has conducted serious checks of he kexins age
7201131 when he was transferred to another team to attend last years national city games her age was registered wrongly
7201132 such doubt emerged just because chinas women gymnasts confronted the u s team strongly
7201133 because asian gymnasts are different in terms of physiques there is this kind of doubt which shouldnt have happened

7201151 but i cant picture us still being beatles when were 30 years old
7201152 when we opened in 69 the average age of our clients was 23 today its probably around 27 and thats taking a lot of people whove been listing their age as 25 for the last six or seven years at their word
7201153 ive never thought that much about age i mean ive always really liked chuck berry and he must be closing in on 50 by now

7201223 the chicago music scene was very exciting its such a big city and it was very welcoming but the portland music scene is great
7201224 theres a lot of people who play a similar kind of music and the label im on hush has a lot of really nice people on it
7201225 that really built my sound i feel like they really added a lot to how the last record sounded
7201226 i was moving for some of the time while i was writing those and i was in a new relationship also so there were a lot of things to write about there was leaving friends and a new love
7201227 my friends and i would do a correspondence sort of like a blog called the getalong one moved to southern illinois and one moved to la and one stayed in chicago and i moved to portland so that song is really about just moving away and keeping in touch
7201228 as many have shared that similar experience of attempting to stay connected to friends i try to do a mix of biographical and general

7201272 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7201273 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7201274 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7201275 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7201276 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7201285 she doesnt always stand out and shes had to work for everything including this national team roster spot
7201286 im very proud of how she represented herself the monarchs and the fans of sacramento
7201287 weve said from day 1 that top to bottom we are a deep team
7201288 we just send wave after wave of players at you
7201289 we were seeing a lot of gang activity focused on drugs especially cocaine
7201290 the people in the community the churches and the neighborhood associations were looking for a way to combat the problem
7201291 it was really a way to get teams of faith leaders community leaders to go into the community and help keep kids off the streets
7201292 i dont think its possible to keep a roof over your head pay for gas and buy food on minimum wage two gallons of gas takes almost one hour of work that alone makes it impossible
7201293 i only spent cash if i couldnt pay with cash i didnt buy it
7201294 theres no way i could survive on that pay alone especially with kids
7201295 when those things collide it makes it even harder for people living on the edge
7201296 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7201297 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7201298 i must tell you frankly ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7201299 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7201300 thats their way of stressing his blue collar roots and saying hes not part of the beltway crowd
7201301 for the average voter it could be a positive it takes him out of the stereotype of the smooth washington insider
7201302 over the past 18 months ive watched barack meet those challenges with judgment intelligence and steel in his spine
7201303 sacramento state is not taking part in the amethyst initiative and does not support lowering the minimum drinking age to 18
7201304 alcohol consumption is the leading cause of highway fatalities involving teenagers and keeping the minimum drinking age at 21 will help ensure that more young people are not added to that national tragedy
7201305 what bothers me about the amethyst initiative is it almost strikes me as throwing up our hand and saying we cant do anything about underage drinking
7201306 if you push the legal drinking age down to 18 you push it into the high schools
7201307 not trying to take the fun out of college by any means but trying to make it more responsible
7201308 are people drinking to get drunk yes but why should we be encouraging it
7201309 no matter what you do to the legal drinking age the situation is going to stay the same at 18 people are leaving the house and moving to a new world
7201310 sure it reflects the superficiality of politics but it also reflects a reality a modern president has to go through
7201311 health and fitness of a candidate is a legitimate issue the president is under enormous pressures and tensions
7201312 and when you look at the two candidates the electorate is bound to make physical comparisons robust health has been a positive image for a president for over a century
7201313 when he had his first debate with walter mondale in 1984 he stumbled badly the wall street journal even ran an editorial questioning senility but reagan came back strong in the second debate but i think everyone knows that during his second term he was not operating at peak capacity
7201314 candidates and presidents have privacy rights like the rest of us
7201315 he was a model citizen on campus he was doing everything right
7201316 whatever was in his past you didnt see it here
7201317 i do know that since he started working out with us over the summer once he got into school he was here every day one of our hardest workers great attitude very coachable
7201318 he was going to be a big part of what were going to be doing
7201319 he still will be the kids are going to dedicate the season to him and try to play it in his memory and honor
7201320 all i know is that my son left the house around 6 oclock and said he was going to the state fair with his friends
7201321 i dont even let him go to any house parties or anything he dont hang out in this area
7201322 we have established that there were individuals associated with gangs at the party
7201323 there were either hard words or hard looks that were exchanged

7201514 carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way because he always does
7201515 but well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race
7201516 he was mad and i can completely empathize with his anger i probably would have done the exact same thing
7201517 i had to ask myself when i went down there in the corner should i lift and brake early and do the best i can or should i just kind of give him a little tap and see what happens

7201525 behind the three major asian powerhouses it shows that they are the next in the power rankings it shows that they can produce elite athletes
7201526 in the game i felt that they could still improve their technique but i think we got better score than we initially expected
7201527 the two north korean athletes levels were not the same so while i will continue to support young mi but i will find someone whose level is as high as wang ok

7201539 we have always urged china to give the widest possible access to the internet
7201540 we acknowledge that the situation has not been perfect but we acknowledge at the same time that the situation was a major change compared to before the games
7201541 you should not forget one thing it is not the ioc running the internet it is the chinese government running the internet
7201542 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7201543 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt

7201616 the love we felt from the people surrounding us and the love we have for each other made this the most beautiful and emotional day
7201617 shes officially off the market no one else gets her and now shell cook and clean for me
7201618 with my interview with mr veger i learned how individuality is so important
7201619 war for defeating terrorism and taking forward the country towards economic development
7201620 i understand that change comes all the time and we all live in a moment of hope
7201621 but it never dawned on me that an african american would get to this point but hey we never know whats going to happen in life
7201622 its all about rallying the troops and building momentum for november and getting people excited about the ticket thats the main point of the convention these days
7201623 ive been trying to recruit for women for obama and some of the people ive talked to say theyre not quite over it yet
7201624 theyre saying were going to be so busy were only going to have time to sleep
7201625 i was getting frustrated because i told her school is about to start and you have to spell your name
7201626 the staff and dr lathan have achieved so much success
7201627 we cannot afford for our students not to receive those same services for continued growth
7201628 it makes me want to call washington the little school that could
7201629 it is what we want and how we want our children to learn
7201630 i think children can regurgitate a lot of information weve got to find that purpose for learning
7201631 parents who have pulled their kids out have felt that were only teaching the lower level kids and were not teaching the higher level or even the middle level students
7201632 what we fight is the stigma that were not a good school
7201633 i think were the best kept secret in guilford county
7201634 it feels more comfortable being in the school knowing its a magnet program
7201635 a lot of students feel when they graduate from school they have to go away
7201636 thats what has all the alumni and community beaming to know that we have such a wonderful program coming here
7201637 the gateway to excellence is as big as a barn
7201638 i think initially it started from a lady at vf corp who volunteered at the schools and saw how some teachers spend their own money on their students
7201639 this is a good way for the businesses to have a direct impact on the students
7201640 were very pleased and happy that weve had the opportunity to do something like this and we cant wait until next year
7201641 we realize that there are parents who cant afford to send extra things and thats where we come in and kind of help take the burden off the teachers
7201642 one thing we want to do is start providing public access currently no one is allowed on reserve property without an authorization letter
7201643 i think in the next year theres going to be a lot of positive things happening here
7201644 there are tens of thousands of kids who come through here every year
7201645 all the bicyclists and the walkers all the people who have no way to get into the reserve will have a way to come out
7201646 im not against public access on the existing trails nor am i for it
7201647 in general i think that all the existing trails that are in ballona should be open to the public
7201648 the friends believe that the public should be offered the privilege of accessing the property that their tax dollars own
7201649 to come in here and just start yanking cars out
7201650 you have to be very sympathetic to everybodys needs but the bottom line of what you have to get back to is this is fish and game land and it is an ecological reserve
7201651 the only way is for a person from the streets to fix it
7201652 but if it is im still willing to sit at the table and talk to them and i dont want to bring any charges against them
7201653 when you think about it no one wants to die
7201654 im not telling them to leave their groups im reminding them why they started to uplift their community and all im trying to do is to bring that back to them
7201655 the only thing i ask for is a chance to prove myself
7201656 but i did not know that admissions were going to be suspended until i got the report from the state
7201657 to me these are really what i would call the fundamentals
7201658 its not like we injured someone its not like we gave them an overdose of drugs
7201659 we didnt follow the correct procedures and those procedures are very tough and stringent
7201660 then we will have a very different conversation with bridgeway
7201661 beatings and interrogation were a daily occurrence living conditions abysmal and communication forbidden while living in solitary confinement
7201662 my method was to take it one day at a time
7201663 it was a motivational workshop so i spoke about the importance of teamwork communication and determination in my own experience in vietnam and tried to relate this to the group
7201664 i had never felt nervous about speaking to the team and coaches but i did feel a powerful sense of responsibility
7201665 i knew my charge was to inspire these guys to come together as a team in a short period of time with a strong determination to win the gold
7201666 lessons in leadership communication faith determination and humor played such an important part in our survival and return with honor
7201667 i also brought my lifetime pass to major league games and expressed the gratitude we all felt in receiving them upon our return
7201668 all the players and coaches came by to sign the jersey as well as a game ball when paul seiler executive director ceo of usa baseball asked if i would like to sit in the dugout for the last pre olympics game i jumped at the chance
7201669 wished he could take me to beijing as he thought the team had really responded to my pep talk
7201670 we tend to go through our days making choices based on goals that we have and results that we want to get
7201671 choice points navigate your career using the unique paperroom process
7201672 i set out to create a process that would reveal that to people
7201673 either they dont know what to do or theyve tried to change what they do and what theyve done hasnt worked
7201674 we want to shed light on things that help us to make choices
7201675 sometimes we make what we think are good choices and things dont turn out like we want
7201676 i wasnt necessarily looking forward to almost a full day of talking about my life
7201677 i thought these are lifeless pieces of paper on a flat wall it was kind of bland
7201678 she didnt give me a check list it was a personal discovery
7201679 we dont go deep on personal history we dont spend an hour on the sofa with it
7201680 its not whats on the outside but whats on the inside that counts
7201681 well arent you just full of ideas bless your heart
7201682 what happened to dont judge a book by its cover
7201683 my performance reviews consistently describe my efforts as exceeding expectation
7201684 our customers have been very strong in their praise of my response to

7201695 for instance joseph biden comes off as a liberal democrat but hes the one who authored the bill that put me in jail he wrote the law against shipping drug paraphernalia through the mail which could be anything from a pipe to a clip or cigarette papers
7201696 rootkits are a symptom of the new cyber crime malware dynamic for malware to be exploited for financial gain stealth is of vital importance
7201697 rootkits enable malware to remain hidden on a computer for much longer without being detected so it is an absolute necessity that users are able to detect and delete them as soon possible

7201701 as a nation we now look forward to holding the olympic games in london in 2012
7201702 the golden triumphs of the present british team can only serve as further inspiration to those who will be working hard over the next four years to make the london games a shining example of olympic success

7201706 you are unlikely to see games of this stature ever again
7201707 on one hand people will understand china better with all its challenges they will remain critical on many issues that is their right on the other hand the chinese definitely have experienced that they cannot live in splendid isolation
7201708 you should not look on the international olympic committee to solve the worlds problems
7201709 its the principle of the ioc that it doesnt make comments on countries laws

7201721 if we continue with that passion drive commitment togetherness well be ok
7201722 but it does come down to that little bit of quality in the final third we had opportunities one or two half chances but we wasted them

7201724 we have this pattern now of finding temples close to the water or under the water in this most recent case
7201725 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual
7201726 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves
7201727 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters
7201728 im sure the myths came first and the caves reaffirmed the broad time and space myths of the mayans

7201760 he was becoming disorientated and confused and he couldnt keep up but you keep swimming youre doing so well
7201761 we can only go this far youll have to swim in alone
7201762 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7201763 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7201764 we cant even flee theres curfew on the one hand and on the other hand militants use us as human shield when they are attacked what we can do
7201765 we have to save this life because its a cute little baby
7201766 thousands might die if we send them to that country well ok then lets do this thing
7201767 well its the launch of the western australian campaign thats precisely what its about dr nelson said
7201768 its about colin barnett and the liberal team in western australia making sure that they take it well and truly up to mr carpenter over the next two weeks
7201769 ive got nothing to say beyond what ive already said dr nelson said
7201770 the important thing here is that its important that the government prepare and release an economic statement our economy is slowing very sharply
7201771 weve got plummeting business and consumer confidence the reserve bank is forecasting inflation at five per cent in december and the economy has slowed to two per cent growth by the end of the year
7201772 deze gasten horen niet in onze samenleving wat zeg ik in onze wereld het is verdomd jammer dat zijn eerste poging tot zelfdoding mislukt is
7201773 some people complain about the care theyve got it in their head that its not a good deal
7201774 people have to understand how many people they take care of it might be a little slower but the volume is just tremendous i think its amazing what they do
7201775 dont get me wrong everything is dollar driven to some extent
7201776 but there is never a push to discharge a patient here because of payment issues
7201777 to go to a va hospital when i started out i wouldnt have done it
7201778 today there is no difference the only difference is that the va has become a respectable medical community
7201779 those two things truly changed the whole focus of the va system
7201780 kizer was the one who said were not going to sit in our hospitals and treat patients
7201781 they have very good doctors and people are super friendly and accommodating
7201782 one of the big reasons is they dont have to worry about money but i think they realize that when they come in that were not making big money and were not driving bmws and they see that were trying to do the best we can for them
7201783 providing this is not something you would find out in the private sector insurance wouldnt cover that its a preventative intervention that i dont know that youll find anywhere else

7201790 joe biden did not count on the 5th option john mccains counter insurgency strategy retrospectively this turned out to be the correct choice
7201791 you know i mean thank god for john mccain in saying whoa what are you guys talking about
7201792 amid fears that the sunnis treatment could rekindle iraqs insurgency the americans are caught between their wish to support the fighters and their stronger ties to malikis government which has challenged the sunni paramilitaries in recent months as it grows increasingly confident about its fledgling army
7201793 we want to have our cake and eat it too support maliki and the sons of iraq maliki wants to make that as hard for us as possible he wants us to choose him
7201794 what it looks like we are getting is a maliki government that wont behave itself and wants to crush the sons of iraq
7201795 the great thing about joe biden during the alito hearings the reason he is to me actually endearing is that as he speaks as he goes on and on and spins his long statements hypotheticals and free associations as he demonstrates yet again as he did in the roberts hearings and even the thomas hearings that he is incapable of staying on the river of a thought and is constantly lured down tributaries from which he can never quite work his way back you can see him batting the little paddles of his mind against the weeds trying desperately to return to the river but not remembering where it is or where it was going i love him hes human like a garrulous uncle after a drink

7201798 maybe 200 to 300 people congregated near where there had been a fire on a property and when we tried to move them down the road it turned to custard
7201799 the police became the entertainment and the crowd congregates when we get our staff together and unfortunately it just makes things more difficult

7201807 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills

7201809 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7201810 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency joe biden
7201811 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7201812 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7201813 barack obama sounded as though he turned over the top spot on the ticket today to his new mentor when he introduced joe biden as the next president
7201814 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7201815 as the army moves closer they will have to rely more on infantry
7201816 we are getting to the stage of close quarter fighting and that is when we can expect more casualties
7201817 though our future targets would be more challenging i am sure we would be able to face them
7201818 it is a high risk gamble the army is taking and they must be careful to ensure that they dont repeat the mistakes of the past and spread themselves too thinly
7201819 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7201820 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7201821 well its the launch of the western australian campaign thats precisely what its about dr nelson said
7201822 its about colin barnett and the liberal team in western australia making sure that they take it well and truly up to mr carpenter over the next two weeks
7201823 ive got nothing to say beyond what ive already said dr nelson said
7201824 the important thing here is that its important that the government prepare and release an economic statement our economy is slowing very sharply
7201825 weve got plummeting business and consumer confidence the reserve bank is forecasting inflation at five per cent in december and the economy has slowed to two per cent growth by the end of the year
7201826 a philosophy of life im an adventurer looking for treasure
7201827 it was overwhelming we were all antsy looking out the window trying to find where the crowd was at and everything
7201828 we developed a lot of good relationships with the iraqi people its almost hard leaving
7201829 they were all heroes the saying goes heroes are the ones who dont make it back so for me to be called a hero or anyone else in this company to be called a hero its pretty hard to take that becuase we havent we didnt give the ultimate sacrifice like they did
7201830 i have never been more proud of anyone in my life
7201831 a little bigger hes a little more muscular and hes cute
7201832 i have heard absolutely nothing from arsene wenger so i thought his comments really strange bizarre

7201834 this thing came on fast with such a radical deluge of water that people were describing going from a feeling of security to waist deep water in a matter or 15 or 20 minutes
7201835 the ground is just fully saturated the runoff from the community just all comes to that part of town this is probably the worst its ever been

7201840 while timeliness and page space is a factor in our published issue theres plenty of room to cover sports online complete with pictures
7201841 we can also publish the game results on the same or next day
7201842 its always been one of my main goals to provide our readers with as much diversity as possible
7201843 over the years ive discovered that theres always a way to reach readers some work some dont but the main thing is to keep trying to provide the best news coverage as possible
7201844 i plan to have a gallery of the game available online but the more you put online the smaller it has to be because of server capacity
7201845 however full size pictures both digital and regular copies will be available
7201846 why in the world am i doing this i dont like this idea why isnt the nurse helping me
7201847 the capitol had the most tree damage among his clients this is by far the worst damage weve been called out on
7201848 in some instances these pockets of colder air can descend rapidly creating a dry microburst which can be extremely hazardous to aviation
7201849 hopefully people have a list of what they owned but unfortunately many wont have that
7201850 even if inventory pictures of items were not taken try to salvage family photos that might show items in the background to help verify what was owned and lost
7201851 also check with companies you may have filed warranties with in order to get proof of ownership of an item
7201852 if people do not have homeowners or renters insurance they are at the mercy of government programs or community help
7201853 it is so important to have insurance and sadly this is a terrible time to be taught that lesson

7201855 with my interview with mr veger i learned how individuality is so important
7201856 but we could also see some more on wednesday afternoon after we get surface heating

7201858 the weather system is connected with the recent deadly weather events in arkansas oklahoma and missouri the potential exists for large hail and some tornadic activity for the northern part of texas beginning on tuesday forecasts show the system then moving to the south and east on wednesday
7201859 for fw things are pretty much done the dry line is right on us the front is right on the doorstep theres an outside chance we could see something in the next half hour or so but really the chances are virtually nil were going to be watching strong and severe thunderstorms east of 35 near the red river but the window for us is pretty much closed

7201866 youve got to do something to make sure the account is considered active
7201867 otherwise the 10 000 you have saved for a rainy day might just be gone when you get around to trying to use it
7201868 theres a guy i work with who got a certificate of deposit when he got out of high school and was all excited when he graduated college because he was going to use it
7201869 this affects everyone your brothers and sisters parents aunts uncles cousins everyone
7201870 people need to be educated so they dont lose their assets
7201871 we hope this will minimize the damage to the landscaping and the neighborhoods
7201872 its a lot more expensive to plant new landscaping than pay the water bills on these properties
7201873 sample homes take a big investment on the builders part especially when you add in the furniture and interest on his construction loan
7201874 but models are necessary in the end if people cant touch it feel it see it they wont buy it
7201875 builders are looking at everything and anything that makes sense to move product
7201876 its almost always enough to cover your nut and then some
7201877 builders want to keep their products fresh so you never know when they may want to start other models
7201878 do whatever it takes to refresh the house back to like new condition
7201879 were not going to use the place nearly as hard as someone else and when you are ready to take possession of the house we treat it as a brand new property as if it is just closing we do a walk through and fix whatever is necessary and the warranty period starts on the day the buyer takes possession rather than the day the sale closes
7201880 if you didnt know you could hit what was needed you shouldnt have taken the assignment
7201881 the office manager asked me directly if i sent you out to appraise a million dollar home and the comps comparable values only came in at 800 000
7201882 the market is full of million dollar houses selling for 750 000 why should i be responsible for adding one more foreclosed property to the already growing list
7201883 was that a form of interference you bet it was
7201884 it was just a little subtler a little less direct than it used to be
7201885 call it odd but hurricanes have only struck texas only on odd numbered years for the past two decades it was hurricane humberto in 2007 hurricane rita in 2005 hurricane claudette in 2003 the costliest tropical storm on record in texas tropical storm allison in 2001 hurricane bret in 1999 and hurricanes chantal and jerry in 1989 you would have to go back to 1986 for an even numbered year to find hurricane bonnie ever since the national hurricane center began naming hurricanes in 1953 only three of the 16 hurricanes to hit texas appeared on even numbered years

7201911 after a very good preparation i wanted to deliver to the spectators a wonderful show but i did not expect that my opponent would get injured
7201912 i think that we got carried away in the moment
7201913 we were having a birthday party and everybody was laughing and suddenly this thing cropped up i didnt catch it quickly enough i was surprised by the attention it received
7201914 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7201915 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7201916 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7201917 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7201918 try to use that word or those words more often
7201919 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7201920 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7201921 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7201922 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7201923 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7201924 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7201925 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7201926 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7201927 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7201928 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7201929 whirlpools i guess this means that whirlpool managed to acquire some of the aura of durability from the long running lonely maytag repairman ads

7201932 a sweeping arc motion that gently rolls clothes through the wash water
7201933 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7201934 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7201935 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7201936 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7201937 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7201938 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7201939 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7201940 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7201941 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7201942 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7201943 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7201944 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7201945 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7201946 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7201947 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7201948 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7201949 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7201950 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7201951 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7201952 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7201953 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7201954 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7201955 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7201956 no wonder i am itchy there are bugs back there coming ffrom the woods ants thousands of them and look at these baby spiders all about to hatch we need to get some bug spray
7201957 we should get out of here youre really luck he is being so cool about all of this
7201958 im really glad that you got to do what youve always wanted
7201959 but ffor some reason that particular morning dream logic just smoothed that whole fifteen dollar bill thing right out for me
7201960 you cant do that that money is for childrens literacy
7201961 no voice applications not use any type of voice application without written permission from aircell
7201962 this is a dream for me because i always wanted to coach this team
7201963 i am here to succeed and gain glory i know that the squad is good enough to give more joy to the fans
7201964 somewhere between my teenage years and a couple of years ago i completely lost touch with my body i was busy with things and i had put myself last on the list i got comfortable with being comfortable
7201965 three years ago i went to the doctor for what i thought was a routine physical i was taking nine medications for panic disorder allergies hypertension pre diabetes steroid inhalers for asthma tranquilizers the weight exacerbated everything i was scared to death i wanted to live i had visions of seeing my own funeral with my parents attending
7201966 it was diet and exercise and accepting i had 30 years of bad habits to change it took 18 months to drop 150 pounds i actually went down lower im now 20 pounds heavier than my lowest point but when i started getting into biking and triathlons i felt too thin
7201967 one thing i did was cut out large meals i eat small portions throughout the day i dont do buffet anymore or have second courses its ok not to finish your plate every now and then if i get a craving i take care of it
7201968 in the beginning if i really wanted a slice of pizza id deny myself and eat an entire 3 pound bag of broccoli and be miserable and then eat the pizza slice anyhow now i take care of the craving and move on with my life
7201969 losing it isnt as bad as keeping it off there are psychological factors of all the habits you amassed you have to unlearn those thats hard get a support group youre accountable to yourself and others
7201970 then i got the phone call that said there was a spot on my lungs
7201971 i immediately thought the worst cancer the doctor wanted to do a ct scan on the day of my daughters birthday party
7201972 at that point i thought i was dying and didnt want to miss the party i took the test a few days later
7201973 they tried to explain it to my husband and i
7201974 it affects mostly the lungs but sarc is called the great mimicker
7201975 sometimes people dont even know they have it because they are asymptomatic or theyll have some nonspecific complaints like fatigue or muscle aches
7201976 the thing thats bad about this disease is that people cant see it because its internal
7201977 you look fine on the outside and they expect you to keep going like you would normally if you werent sick
7201978 last week i took my children to marine world and it took two days to recover from that outing
7201979 the walking uphill and on stairs was taxing on the lungs but you just have to get up and do it because you still have a family to raise
7201980 there are times when you get depressed but you cant let life go by
7201981 its an artificial heart using a catheter it pumps blood independently from the heart while you do what needs to be fixed
7201982 using the balloon pump which ive done for 15 years i never wouldve tried to treat both bypass grafts at the same time
7201983 theres a risk of sending debris down and creating complications we wouldve had to bring him back a couple months later to treat the other vessel
7201984 the device just took over i saw him in the office a couple of weeks ago and his heart had improved significantly two months out his heart is back to normal function
7201985 if you send somebody immediately into surgery the mortality is at least twice that of patients admitted and prepped for surgery
7201986 if you can stabilize them its less shock to the kidneys and the whole organ system and they can get the procedure done two or three days later
7201987 theres no question itll save lives there have been at least two patients this year that come here in cardiogenic shock and died that if id had this device wouldve been saved
7201988 im very worried by this performance but i know this is a great team and we will bounce back
7201989 theres no greater fear for a mother than facing this kind of diagnosis
7201990 in the beginning i was depressed and eating everything in sight i gained 20 pounds
7201991 as a mother i just wanted to fix my little boy i wanted him better i wanted him healthy but now we have a new normal it took me about a year to deal with all that
7201992 i sat down one day with connor and said you havent cried you havent felt bad and he said i just want my mother back
7201993 that gave me permission to let go of my fear to a certain degree i have absolutely no control over his vitality or that of any of my other kids all i have control over is the kind of mother i am today
7201994 we cant fix connor but we can help other people
7201995 thousands of california children are likely to lose health insurance coverage they now have
7201996 weve gone from being characterized as environmental terrorists to being embraced this is like falling down a rabbit hole i feel like alice in wonderland
7201997 its been unbelievable to me that this has happened but this isnt my victory i just sat on guard
7201998 we hope to duplicate the things we do well one county away
7201999 the intent is to operate with a high standard of environmental stewardship
7202000 no person shall stand in a roadway for the purpose of soliciting a ride from the driver of any vehicle
7202001 we are now linked to people who share our faith but who live in another country
7202002 the experience will be beneficial not just to our catholic vietnamese community but with the broader community as well
7202003 vietnamese people in america have education they have jobs they have a better way of life it is easier for them to live out their faith
7202004 in vietnam they are more limited to what they have in terms of finance and that can make them less open minded in terms of practicing our faith
7202005 as vietnam develops it is hard to balance that with making money and having a job in the city and being away from your family and still having your religion grounded
7202006 we are a rural country and traditional society that is changing quickly we dont have experience of living faith in the modern country
7202007 i thought i would like to consecrate my life to god and god could make use of me as he likes
7202008 everyone goes up there and looks around because its got the most amazing view but no ones been able to fix it up and make it a lovely leisurely park to stroll around
7202009 rather than spending years in a court battle and millions of dollars of city money we thought there was a more practical solution
7202010 for a lot of people its a personal landmark in their lives we didnt want someone else to have control over what happened to it
7202011 my father always wanted to go into business for himself and this was where he chose to do it
7202012 we have come through a lot of hard times here some really lean times
7202013 i dont think just anyone can live in the desert it takes a certain person to see the beauty here
7202014 one of the reasons i came back is because my family needed me
7202015 i wanted to be an artist i dreamed about maybe moving to new york but i felt the pull to stay here it really has been a wonderful life
7202016 we go to the river a lot and always stop in for dinner or a malt
7202017 its a unique place with a personal touch there is a pull that makes you want to come in i cant go by without stopping
7202018 i used to see this place all the time on the way to phoenix but i never went in
7202019 i thought it was fascinating that we shared the same birthday i worried though what if i got there and margit wasnt there who would i tell the cook
7202020 in a place like this that seems so empty you have two people who came out to find their dream if thats not an example of californias gold i dont know what is
7202021 to address all of the safety and risk concerns in the family leaving the children at risk in their homes
7202022 i think the challenges are we are dealing with real life people with real life issues we dont know what they are thinking sometimes families dont tell us everything
7202023 we have the ability to do that quick outreach to families and engage them to do the assessment at that we are pretty successful and i think we do well where it breaks down is once the outreach is completed if folks are needing more hands on one on one more intensive services thats a real challenge
7202024 if in home services are provided to reduce the risk maybe the children dont go into the system because once they go into the system its hard to get them back
7202025 the families we are dealing with by and large are multi need
7202026 we are talking about a lifetime of multiple needs the intent of the in home services is to provide services to address the most immediate risk it would be very rare that a family referred to short term service would exit that service with no risks
7202027 if someone has a meth addiction and they quickly get plugged into a support group thats not a bad thing but it doesnt meet the level of intensity that they need
7202028 sometimes getting them more intense services that takes time the demand is high
7202029 she has severe gastric reflux disease she has had a stroke which affects her left side
7202030 its remarkable that you have devoted so much of your time and energy to taking care of four young children who have no other caretaker their mother is incarcerated and has never been able to safely parent them
7202031 i took a parenting class they thought that i needed a parenting class
7202032 and they thought that i needed counseling because i was depressed but nothing for the children it was very insulting
7202033 there arent enough services and treatment options available to families he said
7202034 i dont think we spend enough money compared to other states
7202035 at the end of the day this is what their business has become
7202036 i would like to see statistical evidence of which programs are working and which ones arent
7202037 theres a lot of things to do a lot of things to learn
7202038 we have the role of telling the country why john mccain is the wrong choice to put our country back on track
7202039 we know him weve had to put up with him
7202040 they didnt put their vote of confidence in the guy who wishes to be president
7202041 so its kind of interesting that the party thinks theyre going to play some important role
7202042 it gives democrats and democratic leaders from around the country the opportunity to be together
7202043 it really is the start of the general election campaign
7202044 the party conventions set the major themes and set the tone it gets everybody focused
7202045 i think that suffering through eight years of george w bush has energized everybody
7202046 i see it as working towards common goals meeting people discussing topics hearing different points of view
7202047 he was one of the few voices in the nation who was speaking out from the beginning against what has proven to be a disaster in our country
7202048 its definitely a huge benchmark something ill remember for the rest of my life indeed
7202049 when we rethink our past choices the central question is if everything in us that needed to develop as a result of each choice did have the lives we chose brought us to the fullness of life god wants for each of us the burden of regret is that unless we come to understand the value of the choices we made in the past we may fail to see the gifts they have brought us the blessing of regret is clear it brings us if we are willing to face it head on to the point of being present to this new time of life in an entirely new way it urges us on to continue becoming
7202050 this case encompasses just about every genre of terrorism and criminality
7202051 its an example of gangsterrorism the hybridization of terror and crime from a strategic point of view you realize its about opportunism bellirajs contact with an umbrella of groups from al qaeda to shiite muslims shows that this is business the important thing is profit whether financial or ideological
7202052 his father was in an islamic movement and spent time in egypt involved in armed activity as well

7202056 hears the authority of a judge invoked in the political consequences of every day and he naturally concludes that in the united states judges are important political functionaries nevertheless when he examines the nature of the tribunals they offer at the first glance nothing that is contrary to the usual habits and privileges of those bodies and the magistrates seem to him to interfere in public affairs only by chance but by a chance that recurs every day

7202071 i enjoy it now more than i ever did the touring is fun now we stay in comfortable hotels we spread the shows out over the year we break it up
7202072 of course we adjust to different settings weve been playing with a lot of symphonies lately and that requires different material from say a bike rally but there is such a thing as a typical kansas concert

7202077 i couldnt get most of them to call me back these were the days before the internet and there was no web site to help convince them we were a legitimate operation they could only call our 800 number and that didnt do much good
7202078 we dont allow the competitors to cook directly for the judges either
7202079 on saturday we send runners to pick up ribs that have been prepared for customers those are taken to the judges where a very complicated procedure full of checks and double checks takes place

7202084 we thought about having people go to a central location and pick up the boxes there or drop off at the ends of the street but we decided that just wasnt very feasible having people walk 10 blocks to carry these heavy boxes of food

7202106 i came here the day after finishing the martin scorsese
7202107 i just had the flight time between the two filming schedules essentially thats how its working out its pretty well back to back right now
7202108 which is great because the variety of work i can choose to do now is stupendous i can choose to do a film like
7202109 i can also really allow myself to push the parameters of recklessness in my work i dont mean in my discipline but i do mean in the performance although im absolutely word perfect on the text i did allow myself to be a lot looser and more reckless in
7202110 and i can also choose to play a silly little role like in
7202111 for the most part if you look at my cv
7202112 very often im either the moral center of the film or the political center of the film but to be part of the comedic half of the film as in
7202113 so those four films in philadelphia pretty well represent what im allowed to do now what i allow myself to do and the great position i find myself in which is having these wonderful choices so i say yes i can do that for mike myers that would be wonderful as well as of course doing this immensely committed and dedicated role with penelope in elegy
7202114 there was no accent there is no disguise the clothes i wore could have been mine
7202115 its the closest that ive ever been to sounding and looking like me
7202116 but in order to be challenged by the role and feel the danger in playing him i had to get out of my suit of armor i had to get out of my actors disguise tricks so that was a constant challenge hearing my own voice coming out of my head saying those lines
7202117 i think for me the sustained difficulty was not to judge the character nor to sentimentalize him but ushering him up exactly as he is to the audience and let them accept him without any filtering of my judgment
7202118 so i had to be free of any judgment of him positive or negative and as i say to remove as many layers as possible through which to filter him
7202119 she brings a female essence to a tale of a man and a woman
7202120 people cant quite always get past the sexual politics in some fiction you know if one were writing a biography about hitler it wouldnt necessarily mean that youre a fascist but you do have to explore that mind set
7202121 it wasnt a good experience it was not a safe place to be
7202122 it was really tough i had to do most things by myself
7202123 the goal is to provide ancillary expenses so that these kids wont have a financial burden
7202124 its extremely difficult and disheartening to these kids coming from behind and moving from foster house to foster house we want to give them an opportunity to go to college and succeed
7202125 i always had this nagging feeling what if i remained an orphan would i have had the same opportunities
7202126 ive always wanted to do something like this to create something that will go well beyond me lifetime we want this program to thrive not just in connecticut but throughout the nation
7202127 i was really happy to get the scholarship because its hard to go to school and have to pay for so many things
7202128 i want to help kids who dont have parents or have anywhere to go
7202129 ive come to realize that in the genocide they could have killed me i believe that i was saved and im healthy and doing well it gives me hope that there is something more out there for me
7202130 we are now linked to people who share our faith but who live in another country
7202131 the experience will be beneficial not just to our catholic vietnamese community but with the broader community as well
7202132 vietnamese people in america have education they have jobs they have a better way of life it is easier for them to live out their faith
7202133 in vietnam they are more limited to what they have in terms of finance and that can make them less open minded in terms of practicing our faith
7202134 as vietnam develops it is hard to balance that with making money and having a job in the city and being away from your family and still having your religion grounded
7202135 we are a rural country and traditional society that is changing quickly we dont have experience of living faith in the modern country
7202136 i thought i would like to consecrate my life to god and god could make use of me as he likes

7202139 winston salem now has the most beautiful and most modern minor league baseball park in the nation
7202140 it had been understood all along that the team could remain in the league only if new playing grounds were provided
7202141 the team performed most of the 1955 season in front of jerry built stands at southside park where little comfort and convenience were available to spectators
7202142 i think it will ensure us a modern baseball park and continuing professional baseball kurfees said
7202143 all our citizens should be grateful to mr babcock for this new evidence of his generosity
7202144 i always felt like it was a picture postcard park with the grassy area going all the way down one side and all the way down the other side
7202145 i came in here and said this is the big leagues compared to wellsville
7202146 not only did my sons literally grow up there i grew up there as well
7202147 you think about the history thats come through there since 1956 its pretty amazing
7202148 i mean the stadium had its quirks but it had a minor league feel and it had a heartbeat sometimes its heartbeat was strong and other seasons it wasnt so strong but it survived and thats something other cities cant say about their ballparks
7202149 you dont have to get hit in the head to get a head injury it creates a concussive effect where the brain is bouncing around the skull
7202150 i got to know matt a little bit through his project
7202151 and i have been impressed with his perseverance on his project bob and lisa are good friends and words cannot describe what kind of tragedy this is
7202152 right now there are those who are hurting who are asking why
7202153 right now during this moment may we go to you father and ask for your strength your wisdom and your courage may we take this time to understand how life is precious and a gift from you
7202154 you have rising ninth graders out here teachers and coaches were family what more can you say
7202155 the show of support for the family the show of love for the family was very touching but the fact that you are there on pins and needles for a 15 year old kid it tears at you literally tears at you
7202156 its a once in a lifetime one in a million hit for this to happen to a healthy kid
7202157 he was healthy and well padded he was still breathing on the field but basically they said the damage was done right then and there i have never heard of anything like it
7202158 people would say he is your guy and his older brother was too
7202159 just a good old hard nosed boy thats my kind of guy he did everything i said and asked questions later
7202160 he was just a precious kid i swear i felt real uncomfortable friday night and now its about 1 000 times worse when you know them and have been in their house this family is not just some family its a family that i know real well and i have grown to know and love them
7202161 its real hard the hardest thing i have ever done
7202162 i have to be a leader and be strong because those are my boys
7202163 there was nothing dramatic about it it was a regular old football play or it should have been
7202164 last year 1 8 million kids played high school football and there were three fatalities
7202165 you are more in danger driving to the mall than playing football but its like a plane crash its so visible
7202166 his injuries were severe and unsurvivable from the beginning we supported his breathing and he had neurosurgery within minutes of getting to the hospital
7202167 there were eye popping hits during the game that kids bounced right up from
7202168 sometimes its conspicuous that a kid has done something wrong but this was an ordinary play
7202169 so many things have happened to make football more safe but its still not 150 percent safe
7202170 it would appear this was a devastating injury that nothing could have been done about
7202171 thats small consolation to the mother in forsyth county who now wonders if she ever wants her kid to play the game
7202172 we have found a letter from the spot which indicates that it may be a maoists attack
7202173 there are instances where the rebels have threatened hindu temples here
7202174 everyone here in denver is excited about the ticket it is the perfect blend to bring fresh ideas to inform washington and the experience to get it done
7202175 the knock on obama was experience and he n eeded to bolster his experience and that is what he is doing
7202176 it was a wise choice you have to balance the ticket mccain has been ravaging obama on foreign policy experience and guess what he got trumped
7202177 his choice is a political choice to the extent that he has a lot of enthusiasm from the younger voter but you are not going to get elected by just one segment of the population he has to reach deep into the entire population of the nation to excite everyone
7202178 i dont think it is good choice i think biden criticized obama heavily on his lack of experience which i agree with i think that will come back to haunt him im just not a fan of joe biden
7202179 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7202180 i have a lot of respect for him as a legislator he his very knowledgeable of the united states and how it fits in with the rest of the world
7202181 i consider his a likable person he will make a very fine vice president if elected
7202182 you want somebody whos ready to stand in in an emergency
7202183 but even though joes been there for 35 years he seems to have a lot of energy and passion
7202184 there were some hurt feelings at the end of a long primary season
7202185 she would have been a great asset disappointed yes i think she has the experience to be a good vice president and the experience to be a good president
7202186 joe biden i dont know him hillary would have been a better choice she has more name recognition and would have helped with the female vote
7202187 it is a very serious pick it demonstrates how serious senator obama is about governing how serious he is in reversing the foreign policy failures of the last eight years and how serious he is about moving our economy forward again
7202188 joe biden should be president and barrack obama should be vice president he has no experience
7202189 it would be a lot cooler if you didnt have to pay 10 ten dollars is a rip off
7202190 i used to come here every day but now i go to the park in stamford because its free
7202191 we found in january and february it was really hard to stay open
7202192 most of the kids dont want to pay the 10
7202193 its just a real hassle you train yourself not to fall
7202194 thats the whole mentality of skaters they dont want to wear the pads i really dont get it
7202195 ive seen some kids wipe out really bad and the pads protect them the wrists are the thing that break all the time
7202196 in the five years we probably called the ambulance twice
7202197 this is like my 10 millionth time here and ive seen a lot of people come here with bmx bikes
7202198 i think he should have picked hillary he should have acknowledged all of the people who voted for her i thought she would have been the immediate choice im going to watch more closely if she was on the ticket it would have been more definite
7202199 i think it was the best choice of the top three candidates being considered but i was hoping for someone more a list like al gore it was a good choice though i was planning on voting for obama anyway so it didnt really change my opinion
7202200 of all the choices biden was a good one right now obama needs an attack dog its also good to go with someone who has credentials that he lacks like foreign policy i was planning on voting for obama if he had chosen someone else like john edwards that might have dampened my support but this is good
7202201 i think its a good choice it balances out obamas domestic program with foreign policy experience i think both of them will be improvement on what we have now
7202202 i dont know very much about biden except what i saw on television but i think barack obama is a good choice hes real smart and is going to change things for the better i thought he was going to choose someone more well known but i havent heard much about him
7202203 what happens when you get what you want the growing blogosphere angst
7202204 i just look at each one as an individual case
7202205 people have blogs that become very popular maybe blogging is just the activity of posting content to the web some blogs are journalism and some arent
7202206 gnomedex founder chris pirillo is good at keeping an audience why because he writes good stuff either you write good stuff or you write crap bottom line
7202207 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7202208 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7202209 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7202210 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7202211 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say
7202212 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7202213 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7202214 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around

7202220 people are going to see a very different convention than theyve seen in the past partly because of the kind of campaign that barack obama has been running
7202221 for two weeks every year campaign finance laws seem to get suspended

7202233 there is not a lot of new blood in the advertising industry because its an old boys club so you find that anyone who is trying to change it wont get that far
7202234 what is happening in jamaica and the caribbean is that more people are spending more time online and less time watching the tv and reading the newspaper and listening to the radio
7202235 im not saying that they are the bad guys but they should have been here five years ago
7202236 its too small a market to contribute the marketing dollar to
7202237 at the end of the day what are you going on youre not going on to a jamaican website
7202238 maybe the diaspora would but we are not advertising to the diaspora
7202239 one thing that i was really shook up by was that i thought that advertisers would have been all over something like facebook
7202240 it seems like who has been all over facebook are the promoters of sessions and parties
7202241 direct ad sales are just great because this is just sure money every month
7202242 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7202243 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7202244 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7202245 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7202246 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7202247 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7202275 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7202276 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7202277 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7202278 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7202279 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7202280 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7202281 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7202282 callate la boca no hables m s esta es la ltima la pr xima vez sos boleta

7202284 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7202285 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7202286 el que traicion a su gente una vez lo volver a hacer una y mil veces ha llegado judas a la c mara de diputados se dice que la juventud de su partido no lo quiere que la disidencia no lo quiere y ahora entra por la ventana a este congreso con la supuesta misi n de ser un gendarme de los diputados de su partido
7202287 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
7202288 la ministra de medio ambiente nos aclar que dos funcionarios que hab an trabajado en la conama fueron reclutados por la ani y que ellos como ministerio no han ordenado ni participado de una tarea as es m s la rechazan completamente por lo que ahora pediremos una cita al ministro del interior
7202289 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7202290 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7202291 is someone who wont give the neocons the time of the day
7202292 hes very pragmatic he studies a problem and tries to figure out what the interests are and where the solutions will be
7202293 i think it was built on a fundamental misreading of the situation on the ground
7202294 we were searching for what their common ground would be
7202295 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7202296 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7202297 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7202298 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7202299 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7202300 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7202301 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7202302 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7202303 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7202304 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7202305 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7202306 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7202307 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7202308 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7202309 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7202310 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7202311 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7202312 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a

7202318 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7202319 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners chatters his very tires is what he did i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny hamlin got to his outside and he got by me and then i had to battle with him towards the end we were as clean as could be of course but just one other dude we had a problem with
7202320 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was really mad
7202321 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7202322 earlier this year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7202323 so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made and id do it again

7202333 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7202334 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7202335 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7202336 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7202337 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7202338 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7202339 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7202340 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7202341 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7202342 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7202343 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7202348 what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part through protests and struggle on the streets and in the courts through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time

7202353 for not being a child you certainly do know how to have an impressive temper tantrum
7202354 i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of egoism and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows

7202365 attempting to burrow and disappear into the admiration of certain works of art i tried to make such deep and pure identification that my integrity as a human self would become optional a vestige of my relationship to the art i wanted to submit and submerge even to die a little i developed a preference among others for art that required endurance that mimicked a galactic endlessness and wore out the nonbelievers by ignoring my hunger or my need to use the bathroom during a three hour movie by kubrick or tarkovsky id voted against my body with its undeniable pangs and griefs in favor of a self composed of eyeballs and brain floating in the void of pure art

7202377 you get some injuries like this and now depth matters if you dont have it you better go find it
7202378 they saw something in his delivery they thought would help it was an opportunity to try something in the minor leagues and it worked perfectly for him
7202379 ive simplified my delivery so much that it feels the same to me from the stretch and from the windup
7202380 the other way going over the head was a big difference and so i would almost confuse myself when i would go between the stretch and the windup
7202381 youve got to go through it but its definitely been exciting
7202382 weve raced them many times this year they had a lot of old parts but our crew worked very hard to change them out they did magic
7202383 were having tons of good times i told him when he signed on that we would have lots of firsts and seconds hes a fast kid and a fine driver definitely a great fit for our team
7202384 its pretty amazing i feel great now no ill effects
7202385 by the time they made the decision for sam to go to nascar they already determined i would take his role for me the match was perfect

7202416 wir ober sterreicher sehen diese fusion sehr skeptisch und damit befinden wir uns in guter gesellschaft mit anderen bundesl ndern
7202417 da haben einige spitzenfunktion re und landessekret re angst dass sie nach dem zusammenschluss nicht mehr auf demselben sessel sitzen wie jetzt
7202418 es hat ja keinen sinn hunderte stunden in ein projekt zu investieren wenn es nicht gewollt wird
7202419 weil wir in wichtigen bereichen mit einer anderen als der erwarteten entwicklung konfrontiert wurden
7202420 das stimmt deshalb haben wir unser defizit auch um einen prozentpunkt gesenkt wir haben zwar damit gerechnet dass die konjunktur verflacht parallel mit der finanzmarktkrise ist aber auch eine massive teuerung gekommen das bewirkt eine andere ausgabensituation beispielsweise bei der pensionserh hung

7202436 joe biden is the right partner for barack obama his many years of distinguished service to america his seasoned judgment and his vast experience in foreign policy and national security will match up well with the unique challenges of the 21st century an obama biden ticket is a very impressive and strong team bidens selection is good news for obama and america
7202437 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7202438 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7202439 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7202440 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7202441 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7202442 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7202443 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7202444 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7202445 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7202446 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7202447 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7202448 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7202449 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7202450 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7202451 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7202452 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7202453 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7202454 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7202455 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7202456 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7202457 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7202458 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7202459 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7202460 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7202461 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7202462 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7202463 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7202464 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7202465 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7202466 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7202467 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7202468 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7202469 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7202470 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7202471 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7202472 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7202473 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7202474 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7202475 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7202476 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7202477 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7202478 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7202479 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7202480 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7202481 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7202482 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7202483 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7202484 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7202485 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7202486 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7202487 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7202488 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7202489 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7202490 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7202491 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7202492 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7202493 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7202494 madonna considering shes now 50 is so fit she did a really good job
7202495 a convergence of charismatic characters from every walk of life all of whom employ camp language with consummate skill
7202496 villainaire ice grillionaire tonight i fear theres something in the air
7202497 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7202498 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7202499 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7202500 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7202501 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7202502 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7202503 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7202504 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7202505 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7202506 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7202507 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7202508 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7202509 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7202510 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7202511 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7202512 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

7202522 remember kevin 07 dripping with empathy the motorists friend the shoppers advocate
7202523 there wasnt a petrol station forecourt in the nation or a shopping aisle where he could not be found filled with sympathy
7202524 the empathy of 07 is replaced by the impotence of 08
7202525 the responsibility of the government is to do everything it can to drive confidence in the business community
7202526 confidence to be able to invest to employ people and importantly to lift consumer confidence at the same time that our economy is slowing very sharply with increased inflation and every day it seems increasing evidence of unemployment
7202527 my foolish dream is obama vs mccain in 2008 and that the two of them can somehow lift our desultory politics to a higher place
7202528 both obama and mccain seem willing to put the common good above partisan gain to reach out to foes both at home and abroad to at least begin some honest talk about difficult choices

7202533 everyone said let her go let her go and i was embarrassed because im not that type of person
7202534 standard operating procedure is to not notify the fire department immediately because often times the train is able to regain power and go to the station
7202535 we attempted to do that in this case but when those attempts failed the fire department was notified
7202536 just kind of stopped everybody thought it was a temporary thing we didnt realize it would take so long
7202537 i was relieved to not go up the space needle because im afraid of heights
7202538 its a beautiful city and in spite of this ill be back
7202539 i got afraid when i got on the ladder because i looked down
7202540 we dont need as many outside interest groups telling us whats best for our state we havent had any problems raising money here so we havent had to do a big push to raise money out of state
7202541 governor gregoire has tremendous stature with women across the country there are not that many women governors who stand out
7202542 almost every other attorney general would come in for the cameras but she rolled up her sleeves and worked hard
7202543 then members decide who to support and make contributions directly
7202544 if some contributor is trying to get something down the road then yes out of state money is bad
7202545 but if youre in a knock down drag out fight then candidates are going to grab what they can its the big dollars from corporate types that are usually the lighting rods for us to look at
7202546 special olympics arizona is such an integral part of the sports community around the state
7202547 were proud to have the privilege of providing these much deserving athletes with the opportunity to compete at this global competition
7202548 thanks to the generous donation made by the coyotes team usa athletes from arizona will get a once in a lifetime experience at the 2009 world winter games
7202549 this is the largest sponsorship we have ever received from any professional sports team here in the valley
7202550 our team has been training rigorously to get ready for februarys games
7202551 weve been practicing for two hours every sunday and participating in a fitness program on mondays since the beginning of this year and will continue that schedule until we leave
7202552 experiences like the world games are the key to building the self confidence and self esteem of these wonderful athletes to assist them in fully integrating into their respective communities and enjoy the quality of life deserved by all
7202553 when we first started coyotes charities our goal was to reach out with the intent of bettering the lives of children throughout the arizona community and in this case the athletes of special olympics arizona
7202554 this special olympics arizona sponsorship epitomizes exactly what the organization was created to do
7202555 for the coyotes to go out of their way and do this for us is huge for the special olympics
7202556 this donation fits exactly what we are trying to do with coyotes charities
7202557 im excited about the opportunity to go participate and represent the united states
7202558 its all about the experience for the players i dont think it will really hit the players until we meet in colorado for workouts in december
7202559 the whole pressure of fundraising was tough for the team
7202560 it was a lot of money to raise especially being from flagstaff once this was announced it took the pressure off and now we can concentrate on training
7202561 many of these adults and kids will remember this opportunity for years
7202562 this trip will be life altering for some of them
7202563 a convergence of charismatic characters from every walk of life all of whom employ camp language with consummate skill
7202564 john mccain is certainly well known and has a history of trying to end wasteful government
7202565 barack obama is untested right now youre looking at the mood shift
7202566 they dont know much about him they think they know mccain
7202567 the economy may be one of his mccains weaker points but i feel that he has the experience he knows more readily what would help families
7202568 senator mccain looks like a traditional president an older white guy
7202569 the election isnt a regional election its a state by state election mccains improvement is really republicans coming home
7202570 the economy far outweighs any other issue in this election
7202571 he has to really push that issue its the same way bill clinton won in 92
7202572 my phone died so i borrowed my girlfriends phone and i was checking my messages
7202573 and then i saw i got a 303 phone call
7202574 and someone was like andre what are you doing here
7202575 it was me calling myself from my girlfriends phone i couldnt believe it i was up all night all morning
7202576 it feels like the end of the world when it happens
7202577 the competitor in you hurts but you have to understand that if you sit around and mope youre going to miss the next opportunity
7202578 say you get cut and you take it personally and hold it against the denver broncos what are you going to do when they call you back in three weeks are you going to be ready are you going to be prepared to come back and help the team win games
7202579 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
7202580 well i know those aliens had to wear that weird headgear because their breathing apparatuses were inside of them
7202581 well its not exactly a problem its not my problem its a problem for people who live on zyron with all that equipment covering their faces how do they steal a kiss or two
7202582 a good question starr now let me answer it with another question if you had to live on zyron and if you had to wear all that headgear how could you steal a kiss
7202583 wed like to see them scale up to a full system beyond just tests sooner rather than later
7202584 the difference is we have molasses that degrades very quickly or oil that dissolves very slowly but provides enough dissolved material to feed the bacteria to do the same job
7202585 using vegetable oil it was definitely effective it just didnt have easy distribution they wanted throughout the aquifer
7202586 sleep shhhhh just do it dont argue with me just do it
7202587 have you noticed that we havent fought since i had the erotic dream about you
7202588 this is the first time youve called me since you declared your undying lust for me
7202589 im being sanctioned right now by judge linde as far as im concerned
7202590 our intention is to have all the judges working at full capacity
7202591 it becomes quite obvious that what theyre the prosecutors office doing is judge shopping
7202592 one of the largest embezzlement cases in pierce county history
7202593 im ashamed of myself im sorry not because i got caught but because its a moral wrong
7202594 is there anything i can do now to help with this situation
7202595 worry never robs tomorrow of its sorrow it only saps today of its joy
7202596 but now to me theres a bigger picture to me its way beyond coincidence
7202597 it shows we are doing good things for the neighborhood
7202598 we really want to say lets not each of us do small things
7202599 said pastor joseph fehlen of south everett foursquare where the stakeholder groups meetings and saturdays start out right event were held
7202600 they saw something in his delivery they thought would help it was an opportunity to try something in the minor leagues and it worked perfectly for him
7202601 ive simplified my delivery so much that it feels the same to me from the stretch and from the windup
7202602 the other way going over the head was a big difference and so i would almost confuse myself when i would go between the stretch and the windup
7202603 he did that to us over at their place richie sexson hit a three run homer in the first and then he proceeded to shut us down
7202604 it was a good day all around it felt really good to get out there again and to win again was just a bonus
7202605 all of his pitches were never really in question when he was here the first time it was just the command of the strike zone
7202606 i think the little tweak in his delivery made a huge difference and it showed tonight the ball to strike ratio was incredible it was what guys need to do to be successful at this level and he did it
7202607 whats the news tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe
7202608 our life is like a german confederacy made up of petty states with its boundary forever fluctuating so that even a german cannot tell you how it is bounded at any moment
7202609 pray tell me anything new that has happened to a man anywhere on this globe
7202610 it was the worst start of a tournament ever because we were all so close to them
7202611 but everyone knew the way we could have made them happy it was to go out and play the best way we could possibly play
7202612 and that we came as far as we did i hope people watched at home i hope they saw how this is a true team i hope girls back home saw it this is not just any other game its a world thing you know were here to inspire young kids we never stopped fighting
7202613 were in touch with her by e mail joines said
7202614 we read hers and she reads ours she says it brings a smile to her face when she does
7202615 i play better i just kind of go on my emotions
7202616 the usa team is the best weve seen in the last four years
7202617 but weve got to think about what we really did we accomplished a lot
7202618 you have a style of writing i just cant do
7202619 its hip and contemporary but it has that tribal influence
7202620 the welcome figures the art they remind you youre in a tulalip hotel

7202696 in den vergangenen 18 monaten habe ich gesehen wie barack die herausforderungen des pr sidentschaftswahlkampfs mit urteilsf higkeit klugheit und r ckrat gemeistert hat

7202706 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers will leave the theater thinking retard is an ok word to use
7202707 i have a mentally handicapped brother and when we were growing up all i heard was the word retard
7202708 people called him that and other cruel names it was terribly painful for both of us
7202709 i hope she will get it in time to wear to the convention

7202756 a man who lives in a box for five years can do whatever he wants
7202757 its a little bit of a surprise how strong some of the numbers were in july
7202758 just look at recent months we had record prices in june a sell off in july and a rally in august
7202759 it gives us the opportunity to get the truth out about marks record
7202760 i also wondered why the 911 hijackers spent a weekend in las vegas gambling and boozing it up
7202761 the people in our union who are skeptical about barack obama
7202762 joes about as good a messenger as we can get to those groups
7202763 and once youve got a good messenger the issues cut in our favor
7202764 joes as well known as anybody in southeastern pennsylvania with the possible exception of me
7202765 i was an irish catholic kid from scranton with a father who like many of yours in tough economic times fell on hard times but my mom and dad raised me to believe its not how many times you get knocked down its how quickly you get up
7202766 ladies and gentlemen thats your story thats americas story its about if you get up you can make it
7202767 is genuinely a friend of mine ive known john for 35 years he served our country with extraordinary courage and i know he wants to do right by america
7202768 but the harsh truth is ladies and gentlemen you cant change america when you boast and these are johns words that on the most important issues of our day ive been totally in agreement and support of president bush
7202769 i dont think any one can prepare for this role
7202770 its a lot of long hours seven days a week but you know what youre so busy you dont realize how crazy it is and its just getting crazier so
7202771 everyone said look were going to do this we think it is the right thing to open up this convention to the people of colorado and to the people of the country and to give them the opportunity to participate
7202772 people were a little overwhelmed at first but i think as we evolved as a team together and started planning this out we definitely realized that we could pull this off
7202773 it was fun watching teammates getting tossed into the river especially after they bragged how great they would be
7202774 most people throw very very sharp elbows to get a seat at the table and thats not matts style
7202775 hes quiet so people underestimate him underestimating him could be the biggest mistake that people can make
7202776 one of the things is having been on the obama staff during the primaries doing politics he knows who needs what who needs to be stroked more who needs little extra care there
7202777 he knows that all delegates are equal but some delegates are more equal than others
7202778 you cant plan for every option or any problem that might come up
7202779 but we have a really crack team a very talented team with years of convention experience theyve left no detail unturned
7202780 im not going to get into details of those conversations
7202781 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7202782 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7202783 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7202784 the first probably serious crisis internationally since the end of the cold war
7202785 i am just living it here and not back in america
7202786 in a world of democracies individuals must never be puppets or prisoners of the societies or cultures into which they were born
7202787 when we get the ball to start a half i want to put points on the board we were able to do that
7202788 the most beautiful drive was the first one in the third quarter
7202789 we came back and got that touchdown which was huge
7202790 i think we opened it up more in the second half and they had to think about play action more in the second half
7202791 we got control of the line of scrimmage in the second half
7202792 i planned to run the ball our depth and experience is on the line we started six new skill kids so we have to be able to run the ball we hope that opens up the passing game
7202793 luke is quicker than quarterbacks that ive had in the past hes not quite as good of a drop back passer but his strength is being able to run
7202794 plus we really like justin buenger nick powers will get a lot of runs and i really like my fullback bill miller
7202795 we had a sophomore quarterback that had never played a snap
7202796 at times he looks like an all stater and times when he looks like a first year quarterback
7202797 but there are things we have to do to help him we have to be able to run the ball better
7202798 we make a lot of mistakes right now it has been an ongoing problem for a week and a half we have to be more consistent
7202799 but i am proud that we didnt quit and played hard getting the first game when its the hottest conditions you have been in is very tough
7202800 it came down to big plays they made more of them than we did
7202801 our bread and butter is to run the ball behind the beef we have
7202802 we challenged our linemen i thought we did a pretty good job up front in the second half i thought we got a good push
7202803 we pound the ball late in the game wed zone block to the right and jack is so good he takes two people out gaston just cut back both times and the hole was there
7202804 st johns is a very good team and im proud of our kids but we didnt get the win and thats what we came out here tonight for
7202805 oh king carl get rid of him and well all rainbows and win super bowls every year
7202806 you dont know what its like to be a dedicated fan of a continuously losing team
7202807 we are firm about not having the champions trophy relocated
7202808 but we are expecting the icc to postpone and reschedule it for a later date
7202809 our government is also clear that if the tournament is postponed it will help us to convince these countries that it is safe to play in pakistan and the event must be held in pakistan at a later date
7202810 these charts were called quadrants and navigators in the 15th century used them the way we would use gps today
7202811 they would poke pins in there to triangulate position and try to figure out the time
7202812 im not able to strengthen my muscles or extend my range of motion
7202813 if there is another surgical procedure in the near term you could say the pendulum has really turned in that direction
7202814 people are getting nervous because the elephant in the room is still there and the elephant is racism
7202815 the great thing about americans is that weve always been able to push ourselves forward
7202816 we didnt protect the quarterback very well on the whole and we have to look at that obviously that is a huge problem for us
7202817 but were just going to have to wait and see
7202818 especially a guy like osi he definitely means a lot to this team and franchise anytime a guy like that goes down it definitely hits you right in the throat
7202819 i just told him to keep his spirits up were praying for him and wish him the best
7202820 hes got 11 days to get better hes got 11 days to get back in the game hopefully hes back by the opener on sept 4
7202821 anytime a guy like that goes down it definitely hits you right in the throat

7202823 nos recuerda constantemente que toda esa obsesiva y subversiva corriente de cine de saldo y subcultura de derribo y su extra a mezcla de belleza y miseria discurre simultanea a lo cotidiano

7202833 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7202834 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7202835 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7202836 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7202837 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7202838 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7202839 the period of debate is closed arms as the last resource decide the contest the appeal was the choice of the king and the continent hath accepted the challenge
7202840 what would be needed were americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part through protests and struggle on the streets and in the courts through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time
7202841 that do not pose a significant risk of systemic financial crisis
7202842 the regulators realized we were going to move and that theyd get embarrassed and they decided theyd better change their positions
7202843 sometimes what we intend to be stopgap turns out permanent
7202844 were interested in stabilizing the market that means stabilizing real estate prices and going where the free flow of capital funds has failed to develop substitute methodologies then when we get the entire system working again over the next 12 months were going to go into a very thorough examination of how we got there and what has to be changed were not anywhere near that right now
7202845 they were small enough to fail but they had 12 trillion in securities bets with clients
7202846 nobody knew what would happen if that started to unravel thats a whole new concept
7202847 its important for congress to draw lines rather than dealing with this on an ad hoc basis it will be really interesting to see if the fed accepts that notion
7202848 congress has always had the authority to step in and provide guarantees or bailouts for sectors it deems crucial thats the key to what kanjorski was getting at
7202849 once the dust settles there is going to be some new understanding of the law that guides the federal reserve
7202850 i know ben stiller has said that hes making fun of actors not people with disabilities still the movie is geared toward a younger crowd and i fear a lot of those teenagers will leave the theater thinking retard is an ok word to use
7202851 i have a mentally handicapped brother and when we were growing up all i heard was the word retard

7202862 you should not look on the international olympic committee to solve the worlds problems

7202866 erm actually we looked again and you aint that sexy and is that a spot anyway well let you do it now
7202867 theyre not worried about their health care theyre not worried about these issues that weve put on the news
7202868 instead of saying i support obama because of his views on free trade agreements too many young people say they like him because they think hell make the economy fair
7202869 but if you ask them to explain what that would mean theyre at a loss

7202949 the game is being run for the benefit of agents rather than the customers
7202950 when you want to play at the top you must start the game with the right attitude and personality thats what we didnt do and thats a good learning lesson it was the kind of game where you couldnt afford a mistake at the back or at a set piece i believe they wanted it a bit more than us in the first half and the corner when they scored shows that
7202951 im doing well and im happy i had been hoping to come back to ac milan for a while and already yesterday i imagined this negotiation could end well for me its as if ive won a champions league there were some complications but now that everything has been resolved i am truly happy
7202952 why are clubs messing about like this because they can yet only at the end of the month three weekends into the season will many of their customers be able properly to judge the prospects for the campaign and that is a disgrace something must be done or it will begin to look as if the game is being run for the benefit of agents rather than the customers perish the thought
7202953 manchester united have made a 25million take it or leave it bid
7202954 senior players at tottenham have made clear their concerns to manager juande ramos that the protracted transfer of dimitar berbatov to manchester united is proving disruptive to the club
7202955 newcastle are ready to spend 12million on chelsea winger florent malouda if stamford bridge boss luiz felipe scolari signs robinho from real madrid
7202956 i cannot remember any player who left arsenal and has been a superstar
7202957 capello also needs to be told there is one battle he will not win i think one of the big problems is the newspapers which dont support us
7202958 you would think that by now the message would be getting home we are of no use whatsoever were s but incredibly we still dont know we are
7202959 harry redknapp wants to manage the great britain football team at the 2012 olympics
7202960 ive had some great managerial jobs during my career but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake the fact it is being held on my old stamping ground in east london makes it even more appealing
7202961 the trouble with the window is that it stays open too long as we noted here last week it was interesting at first while nothing else was happening to observe say manchester uniteds tactics in retaining cristiano ronaldo while luring dimitar berbatov but then the close season ended the premier league started and the speculation became an irritant an insult even to the people who were paying good money to watch teams that appeared little more than works in progress why are clubs messing about like this because they can yet only at the end of the month three weekends into the season will many of their customers be able properly to judge the prospects for the campaign and that is a disgrace nine days ago due to pressure of work i missed a deadline to name a fantasy football team imposed by the nice people at barclays there could be no complaint they wanted everything in place for the big kick off marvellous isnt it the leagues sponsors have more stringent regulations than the league itself something must be done or it will begin to look as if the game is being run for the benefit of agents rather than the customers perish the thought
7202962 manchester united have made a 25million take it or leave it bid for dimitar berbatov sir alex ferguson made his move yesterday and now expects to land the bulgarian by the end of the week berbatov who handed in a transfer request last week was left out of the spurs side which crashed 2 1 at home to sunderland yesterday
7202963 senior players at tottenham have made clear their concerns to manager juande ramos that the protracted transfer of dimitar berbatov to manchester united is proving disruptive to the club the sunday telegraph understands that a deputation of players met with ramos last week to ask for the situation to be speedily resolved while there has been no suggestion that berbatov has been unprofessional some senior players are worried that the situation is proving a distraction to a side that has been radically overhauled in the summer
7202964 first robbie keane leaves saying joining liverpool is a lifetime dream of mine i hope the fans can forgive me
7202965 in the latter stages of pre season scolari devoted two consecutive days to training solely on set pieces doggedly schooling his players on marking and defensive positioning by the second day one senior international accustomed to getting his way with coaches decided enough was enough brashly informing his new boss that the team had got it now reminding the midfielder that chelsea had lost 19 goals from dead balls over the past 12 months scolari returned him to work the sessions have continued this past week
7202966 we enjoyed the portsmouth game and the crowd were brilliant we knew as soon as the game started we would play well and win when you open the game with a quick first goal everything becomes easier and with the quality we have it was a great situation for us we tried to play a different way we tried to use the quality of all our midfielders and use our technique skill and passing game arsenal always play good football but sometimes it is not enough because in some games in the premier league you have to fight hard you cant use only technique
7202967 stewart downing will plead with middlesbrough to listen to any 14million bid from liverpool the winger a sub in englands midweek draw with the czechs believes his ambitions will be aided by a move to a champions league club rafa benitez has been considering an offer all summer but with his focus on the gareth barry saga downings hopes of a transfer appeared increasingly unlikely
7202968 the last time thaksin shinawatra was present at a game at eastlands it proved the catalyst for sven goran erikssons departure but the swedes replacement mark hughes maintains that todays visit to see his team play west ham will mark the beginning of a more settled spell for manchester city yesterdays revelation that thailands former prime minister who fled his homeland earlier this month in the face of corruption charges could stand down from the city board in order to satisfy the premier leagues fit and proper person test only underlines that he intends to hold on to the ownership of the club city maintain that his title may change to satisfy the premier league but thaksins real position will not hughes met his boss for the first time in london last week and as well as being given assurances about the future of the club he was handed more than 6m to sign the belgium international vincent kompany on a four year deal from hamburg
7202969 although the 4 2 scoreline suggests city were well beaten at aston villa last week the game was evenly contested city played some good free flowing football with martin petrov and elano at their most creative but the game was lost in the seconds immediately after they conceded possession good defensive teams respond quickly to the ball changing hands but against villa city were slow to react both mentally and physically three of villas goals were a result of midfielders recovering at half pace rather than breaking their necks to rectify mistakes while defenders failed to see danger before it materialised
7202970 having just parked his porsche cayenne in the middle of the motor show that is chadwell heath he admitted that the money footballers earn was ample compensation for criticism of almost any sort even from disgusted of wembley last wednesday
7202971 i cannot remember any player who left arsenal and has been a superstar dont get me wrong alex hleb and mathieu flamini are two of my best friends in football and i wish them all the best
7202972 im surprised reading things from ex players who say things about arsenal that are not positive with spain we were probably the second youngest side and we won the euro 2008 tournament there will always be people who want to put us down but we have to be strong and keep fighting for our objective we have to show the fans they can see good football but also win something
7202973 newcastle are ready to spend 12million on chelsea winger florent malouda if stamford bridge boss luiz felipe scolari signs robinho from real madrid and newcastle owner mike ashley has sanctioned a late transfer window spree which could bring in malouda and up to three more players
7202974 michael owen will be involved in crunch talks with newcastle this week as his future hangs in the balance
7202975 we are getting towards the business end of things now it has gone on for so long without any real progress being made and it cant continue too much longer reports that newcastle are offering the england international a 140 000 a week deal are grossly inaccurate
7202976 michael owen and shay given gave newcastle supporters a lot to tell their absent friends about and there will be plenty of them to hear it in spite of incentives like free booze for those who got in their bar room orders up to 50 minutes before the kick off complimentary tickets to schoolchildren and cash entrance money for the first time in years the match was played before 47 711 the lowest first game attendance at st james park since the ground was extended in 2000 there were almost 5 000 empty seats at a club where there used to be a waiting list for season tickets if kevin keegan is showing some signs of getting it right on the pitch clearly the toon army are not convinced an unthinkable scenario when their huge regard for the newcastle manager and former playing superstar is taken into consideration
7202977 everton boss david moyes is finally set to make a splash in the transfer market by signing spain winger albert riera moyes has agreed a club record fee of 12million with espanyol and hopes to fly in riera for talks this weekend and beat bitter rivals liverpool to his signature riera is keen to come to merseyside and cash in on the form that earned him five caps moyes had been despairing of landing players but goodison chairman bill kenwright is poised to write his biggest ever cheque
7202978 perhaps one should never read to much into a friendly at this time of the year but capello picked out wednesdays months ago as the deadline for england to be competitive and to show they could play as a team you didnt need to be harry redknapp to spot the flaws though the portsmouth managers caustic comments did add much needed spice to what would otherwise have been an unforgivably insipid wembley occasion
7202979 we have been here before for the last five years in fact which is one reason why capello seems to be presiding over the end of a tired old era rather than the start of a bright new one
7202980 david beckham will emerge on an open top double decker bus in beijings birds nest today and hoof a football into a crowd not that much different from what he did at wembley on wednesday night that has been beckhams stock in trade for england lofting balls into a crowded penalty box today as part of the london 2012 handover ceremony beckham will do his bit for the country by lobbing some sort of fancy ball into the athletes gathered below it will sum up what beckham has become distinctly more showman than sportsman
7202981 who would have believed it an england attacker is accused of lacking selfishness not once but repeatedly and legitimately yet how good it was to hear wayne rooney insist even at the risk of vaguely conflicting with his boss sir alex ferguson that he would continue to do what came naturally lots of very good players especially strikers have been selfish great ones tend to be team men relishing their responsibility to others and here diego maradona comes to mind or believing that since they have the privilege of being able to envisage the big picture they might as well paint it johan cruyff a detour into selfishness might take rooney off course
7202982 once again the croatians loom ominously on englands horizon and once more the first name on the team sheet should be that of owen hargreaves but will fabio capello who eventually conceded late last wednesday night that the grit in his midfield had been badly missed against the czechs be permitted the opportunity to avoid the crucial selection error made by steve mcclaren before the european qualifying match against slaven bilics side nine months ago
7202983 i am not sure what is the more depressing thing about englands midweek friendly against the czech republic the witlessness of the football or the surprise and disappointment that greeted the 2 2 draw hell at least we got a point in the past year or so england have been easily beaten by arguably the weakest team to have qualified for junes european championship france and beaten twice by the middle ranking also rans croatia in case the point needs to be reinforced we will be beaten by croatia again within a matter of weeks the czech republic are mid ranking also rans as well so a draw however fortuitous and clawed from the bottom of a barrel represents an improvement of sorts you would think that by now the message would be getting home we are of no use whatsoever were s but incredibly we still dont know we are
7202984 harry redknapp wants to manage the great britain football team at the 2012 olympics the portsmouth boss believes the chance to lead a team into the london olympics would be an unbelievable honour redknapp said im absolutely flattered that my name is being mentioned about managing the great britain team would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to ive had some great managerial jobs during my career but there is no doubt this would be the icing on the cake the fact it is being held on my old stamping ground in east london makes it even more appealing
7202985 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7202986 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7202987 i wrote the book and i still cant do it completely
7202988 this is not provoked by any emotion its just that people are too lazy to use the real words
7202989 try to use that word or those words more often
7202990 when i start to get impatient i ask myself how long is this really going to take
7202991 youre just creating stress for yourself that you dont need
7202992 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7202993 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7202994 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it
7202995 any student i have thats an immigrant to this country or their familes are ill be able to identify with them
7202996 when i left the practice i had 85 cases i was workng on on my own
7202997 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7202998 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7202999 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7203000 remember when gay meant happy and fag meant cigarette language is constantly evolving and changing and so is the acceptability of certain words especially profanity
7203001 i grew up around bikers old hippies plant workers sailors fisherman all of that
7203002 its not like ive been around nothing but polite speaking people my whole life
7203003 sometimes i dont realize it until someone points it out
7203004 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7203005 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7203006 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7203007 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7203008 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result
7203009 todays america is much coarser some might say ruder than in decades past
7203010 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7203011 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7203012 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7203013 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7203014 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7203015 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7203016 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7203017 but youve got to have some standards were not animals
7203018 dont say anything you wouldnt say in front of your parents
7203019 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s
7203020 as long as they dont do it around the customers we really dont stress not cussing
7203021 if youre talking with your buddies in the hallway it will probably be overlooked
7203022 some people dont understand what you mean until you start cussing at them
7203023 raising fares is not what we want to be doing
7203024 our field records will be perhaps the most valuable of all our results you cant tell in advance which observations will prove valuable do record them all
7203025 climate is the culprit i dont think there is any iota of reason not to think that
7203026 eventually its going to get shoved off these mountains and go extinct
7203027 animals that are relatively static have a much more limited ability to move if climate changes faster than they can find new habitat theyre out of business
7203028 wed be sitting in camp and wed both be skinning pretty soon hed throw a rat over to me and hed say here russell finish this one up and hed just pick up his notebook and start writing
7203029 i appreciate the school supplies because some parents really cant afford them right now
7203030 we had a lot of fun and so many of these parents are so grateful for the school supplies
7203031 the whole thing was just nice for the little ones
7203032 we want these kids to be champions off the court in life thats our goal
7203033 we had a light trickle of wind most of the day friday but we didnt have enough marine layer i call it freon to really make the temperature go down
7203034 with a strong delta breeze it would be about 56
7203035 we got spoiled with those days in the low 80s
7203036 its kind of a way for other agencies and the public to see where were at as far as our readiness
7203037 since its on the web site the public if theyre interested can get a view of what were doing based on the floodcon status
7203038 in a significant weather event they obviously want to be in a higher state of awareness and take precautions
7203039 most people will already understand that during times of heavy rain the risks of flooding are greater
7203040 what is missing is better information for residents on the flood risk for their areas
7203041 im pretty sure i can get my people in there for three weeks
7203042 we wanted to figure out a creative way to build something that was sustainable
7203043 this method has been used for 10 000 years people all around the world have been building their houses like this
7203044 its labor intensive but thats not always a bad thing
7203045 sacramento state is not taking part in the amethyst initiative and does not support lowering the minimum drinking age to 18
7203046 alcohol consumption is the leading cause of highway fatalities involving teenagers and keeping the minimum drinking age at 21 will help ensure that more young people are not added to that national tragedy
7203047 what bothers me about the amethyst initiative is it almost strikes me as throwing up our hand and saying we cant do anything about underage drinking
7203048 if you push the legal drinking age down to 18 you push it into the high schools
7203049 not trying to take the fun out of college by any means but trying to make it more responsible
7203050 are people drinking to get drunk yes but why should we be encouraging it
7203051 no matter what you do to the legal drinking age the situation is going to stay the same at 18 people are leaving the house and moving to a new world
7203052 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket

7203054 we can use all the prayers we can get for the cause of peace
7203055 see that barack thats a religion of peace that has been hijacked by a tiny minority of extremists
7203056 the president continues to talk about the war on terror that is simply wrong
7203057 terrorism is a means not an end and very different groups and countries are using it toward very different goals if we cant even identify the enemy or describe the war were fighting its difficult to see how we will win
7203058 the war in chechnya is a war of liberation it engaged in terrorist activities but it it is fundamentally different

7203062 not just theology this is how all debates should be
7203063 when we watch commercial tv read newspapers attend weddings and sporting events or drive through our neighborhoods at easter religion all gets a free plug but to find something about skepticism you have to go look for it on the internet or at a bookstore
7203064 its an honor to be recognized on the same list that has recognized innovators such as godaddy and microsoft
7203065 the hard work and dedication of our employees is what brought us to this point and im extremely proud of them for all of their accomplishments
7203066 innovation is at the core of our thinking all of the time reaching our customers and providing them with extraordinary service from our seamless operation is also a large contributor to our success
7203067 the industry is large and we do not see companies curbing their appetite for promotional products
7203068 many girls feel more comfortable around dogs than they do around horses
7203069 the animal is going to mirror the emotions the girls are expressing
7203070 the benefit is that there is this exchange going on between the girls and the dogs
7203071 the bottom line is that animals are always in the present
7203072 when the girls work with them it can be magical
7203073 choosing hosting often feels like a trivial decision for bloggers starting out but all it takes is one post to hit a site like digg com and the traffic spike could take their site offline
7203074 its vital for anyone serious about blogging to make sure theyre hosting with a company thats can scale up as their blog grows
7203075 over the past four years weve seen the gradual emergence of energy efficiency as an issue for data centre managers in the region but only this year did the issue break into the top five areas of concern in a big way
7203076 interestingly the survey also shows us that power densities in asia are following closely those found today in the u s where in the past american trends were not seen as a benchmark for asia we can now draw much closer parallels between the regions which has planning implications for all of us in addressing the issue at a regional scale
7203077 this response is symptomatic of an audience that has been barraged by conflicting information from the main industry players
7203078 this was the single most important problem we set out to rectify with the energy logic symposiums because confusion leads to inaction by bringing industry leaders and decision makers together weve sought to find a cohesive understanding of the issues and identify appropriate solutions
7203079 the best way to ensure energy efficiency is through a holistic approach that includes it equipment efficiencies best practice data centre design and efficient power and cooling infrastructure
7203080 energy logic is the first practical framework that can be used to measurably reduce energy costs by applying 10 technologies and best practices that have the greatest impact on energy efficiency in the data centre
7203081 adaptivexchange will take the concepts introduced by energy logic and transform them into practical actionable solutions that can immediately be implemented in computer rooms and data centres
7203082 the event represents a major forum for data centre professionals from around the region and through the user group and survey will be used to develop and share practical energy efficiency strategies on a regional scale i encourage anyone who has even a passing interest in energy efficiency to register today
7203083 our approach has been exceedingly effective for both young men and women we are uniquely positioned to give clients the wake up call of wilderness therapy as well as the counseling services and tools to stay clean and sober permanently
7203084 we are the only wilderness program out there that teaches daily living skills and helps clients acclimate to being in a community setting prior to discharge so the transition onward doesnt come as such a culture shock that gives each individual a chance to see how recovery will look for them not just in the wilderness but back in real life
7203085 by living and working with these young people day and night both in the unfamiliar wilderness setting and familiar base camp environment we can go beyond words and talk therapy and actually see how their substance abuse and co occurring issues impact their daily lives
7203086 in just two years we have established a strong national reputation for clinical excellence
7203087 our therapists travel all over the country to attend conferences develop new skills and improve the quality of their services their hard work has helped us make a name for ourselves in a relatively short period of time
7203088 the substance abuse field is relatively young so there is always room for improvement
7203089 one of our hallmarks is that were never satisfied with the status quo we are always evolving and finding new ways to provide the highest quality clinical services and state of the art treatment when it comes to substance abuse and co occurring mental health issues
7203090 imagine being able to get up at dawn on a stormy sunday morning and photographing the maryland statehouse the u s naval academy chapel st annes episcopal church and the chesapeake bay with the sun peeking out of the clouds over the bay the scenery is startlingly beautiful
7203091 cost conscious it planning must anticipate a variety of economic scenarios
7203092 this white paper outlines the many expenses associated with a data center infrastructure and presents proven viable recession proofing strategies for maximizing operations while minimizing costs
7203093 when it comes to paying child support there is seldom agreement
7203094 mothers and fathers will either claim they cannot pay the support ordered by the court or that they cannot live on the support ordered by the court paying child support is never an easy aspect of divorce proceedings
7203095 support is usually based upon all gross income including overtime and bonuses for the past 12 months of both parties number of children percentage of time each child is with parent
7203096 since our population is living longer people are developing higher expectations for a better quality of life in their senior years

7203231 i was just trying to hang on because the cramps kept coming

7203237 you learn how to deal with pressure through experience and that was part of my experience
7203238 in college there are always a few butterflies walking into falcon stadium but once the game gets going youre just playing ball with your teammates i have nothing to be nervous about
7203239 with shea smith hes been here for a while and it helps being a senior at the academy
7203240 you figure out the daily routine with academics and things you have to do within your squadron and hes got a real good grasp on what we do offensively
7203241 runs quite well and you can see hes got some flashes of being able to do things more dynamic
7203242 right now shea is the starter so im pretty sure hes going to take the first snap
7203243 i tried to bring the game film here this summer but i brought the wrong year
7203244 i want to take a look at that to see if i ever got a good hit on him
7203245 there were just so many plays that i was so used to making but the running back wasnt there it was because 94 wasnt next to me
7203246 he makes my job so much easier we depend on each other to keep the ball between us
7203247 i think george does enough talking for both of us
7203248 if you give brandon an edge hell take it right past you
7203249 i always liked him at notre dame i thought hed become a good player but hes really gotten bigger and stronger
7203250 sometimes you just want to kind of feed off the crowd a little bit especially in late august
7203251 sometimes it gets your adrenaline going a little bit in that situation and you get the crowd going and you try to get a win
7203252 you dont get that many chances so to have another chance with the bases loaded i was excited to have another opportunity
7203253 ive never had that play before willy was right on my back but im sure glad we were both safe
7203254 i swung at the first slider by about 6 feet and figured i wasnt going to have much chance of hitting him
7203255 i looked at the third baseman and saw that he was playing back and figured my best shot was to lay down a bunt i made something happen right there
7203256 razbunarea este un fel de mancare care se serveste la rece
7203257 its one of those deals where i couldnt get by him and i just had to ask myself would he do that to me

7203260 whatever carls going to say hes sorry that he didnt want to race that way but he always does well take it well go on and well race him that way in the chase if thats the way he wants to race

7203272 to me going to a game is not like its the end of the world i never ever picked up a golf club in august september or october
7203273 my phone died so i borrowed my girlfriends phone and i was checking my messages
7203274 and then i saw i got a 303 phone call
7203275 and someone was like andre what are you doing here
7203276 it was me calling myself from my girlfriends phone i couldnt believe it i was up all night all morning
7203277 it feels like the end of the world when it happens

7203324 this is the olympic games people pull out great performances all the time im really proud of the team and im happy we ended on such a high note
7203325 ive been getting eight to 12 fish this size most mornings until the recent storm systems stirred things up
7203326 i wont do guide trips when its slow like this
7203327 these big fish are from plants in the late 1990s
7203328 i was so glad to get him that win it had been a long long time
7203329 i was worried about getting myself back into a normal rhythm
7203330 he hit that ball hard down the right field line when he hit it i was a little worried but with the spin on it i could tell it was going to go foul
7203331 anytime you can work through the heart of that lineup with no outs and the bases loaded and come out with no runs youve done something
7203332 hes pitched better in the past and we need better from him to keep him in the rotation
7203333 we got him to pitch innings now more often than not the bullpen has had to pick up quite a few innings
7203334 i know i dont pitch good and i said im sorry to the organization because the last two starts here are horrible
7203335 we were seeing a whole lot of balls that were moving
7203336 its time to enjoy our moment we played a really bad game against the u s you know but now we learn a lot from that experience and we want to try to win the finals
7203337 we are going to be ready for sure we are going to play better than the other game that is no question we are in the finals for something and we are going to try to win
7203338 everyones thought about the moment when you lean down and they put the medal around your neck
7203339 we know its going to be a great moment and we know we still have a job to do to get to that moment but its always good to dream were not shying away from our sensitivity we know melos going to cry
7203340 those tattoos are just a cover up hes soft inside hes mushy and its going to come out
7203341 and to think about what we went through if we win its going to be amazing
7203342 the way we beat them the first time means nothing they will be ready and i will make sure my guys are ready too
7203343 we got to play better than we did tonight were expecting this game to be different
7203344 of course im pleased with the medal im pleased with the title that comes with the medal
7203345 i cant tell you how happy i am to have worked for something for so long and finally accomplish it and have all my dreams come true
7203346 its been a while since weve had the decathlon gold medal brought back to the states
7203347 i was just blown away 19 years old and getting diagnosed with cancer its crazy
7203348 im like how can i go from having this nice figure to this its a blessing that i was able to make it through it i thank god i thank him every day
7203349 they told him he wasnt going to be able to do a lot of things but he did it anyway
7203350 he inspired me letting me know no one can tell you you cant do anything because you can you can do anything you put your mind to
7203351 its a slowed down version of tennis and table tennis
7203352 i cant run at all but i can play this fairly decent
7203353 its a good draw for seniors it gives you a good workout
7203354 people can only dream of doing what hes done hes basically cemented himself as a legend of track and field
7203355 i dont think any performance can top what hes done here
7203356 usain wanted to start he wanted to lay the hammer down from the start
7203357 the coaches wanted him to run the third leg we listened to the coaches
7203358 my take is that the chinese have developed a system that produces a steady flow of talented young athletes across many olympic sports
7203359 based on their performances here in beijing i would have to say they are not only ahead of the curve they are creating the curve
7203360 you have to take into consideration the various cultures and lifestyles of the different countries in determining the impact of bringing very young athletes into your athlete development pipeline
7203361 it appears to be working in china but i would have serious reservations about trying such a program in the u s
7203362 we make sure the athletes have fun with this program because their interest is most important
7203363 it will be a little strict but the athletes must have fun
7203364 im not here because of my parents i want to be a pingpong player myself
7203365 the chinese emphasis on development at the early ages is to teach skills not competition
7203366 this is a major difference from usa and other countries in china athletes are rewarded for learning the skills proficiently versus concerned about winning
7203367 and there is a much more consistent coaching style throughout the chinese system than you see in most countries
7203368 and we appreciate that everybody pays so much attention to our school
7203369 we simply want the federation to work with the national federation to just put to bed once and for all the questions
7203370 i knew i had to play the game of my life to keep us in this
7203371 its my best game as of yet but theres more to come youll see
7203372 cornelius md is awesome and his original works are special in their own right
7203373 after hearing cornelius md perform i had to bring his talent to the barry white organization so that they could hear
7203374 when i heard him for the first time i thought he was barry until someone told me differently
7203375 when i listen to cornelius mds sample clips i thought he was barry white and i have heard a number of impersonators
7203376 cornelius md would do an awesome job and is the best man to carry on the barry white tradition
7203377 of all the singers weve heard who try to sound like barry white cornelius md is the closest to the legendary artist
7203378 he came to my house and basically was talking about how to peak how to go to a big time event and produce your best performance
7203379 he was obviously a very talented competitor himself and knew what to do but was feeling that he was slightly underachieving at the big events
7203380 the only way to learn experience without actually going through it yourself is learn from somebody else
7203381 kenny was not afraid to ask a couple of people to make the contact with me and i love to talk so i was more than obliging
7203382 the following day they went out and lost to carlow which is one of the favorite teams losing to one of the lower down teams so it was a bit of an upset
7203383 i wouldnt say i have a 100 percent record in these things but it is great to see kenny doing so well
7203384 hopefully i can make the team if i can play well here this week and next week
7203385 id like to make the team outright i still think i need to play well this week and next week to get a pick i would like to qualify on my own terms
7203386 ive done it in europe and it would be very nice to do it in the states
7203387 they want greg normans and fred couples and tiger woods they dont want guys youve never heard of
7203388 its supposed to be a human sport yet theres equestrians going on there i think golf would be a great thing for the olympics
7203389 if we win only one gold medal again i will jump off the highest building
7203390 and now were talking about a chance to win the fedex cup
7203391 the tour said they wanted more volatility but are they setting themselves up for a guy like me
7203392 have i had a better year than kenny perry or padraig harrington no but the playoffs arent all about who had the best year its who is playing well in the playoffs the new york giants certainly were not the best team in the league but they won the super bowl
7203393 i seem to be the biggest procrastinator in the world when it means something
7203394 its a wonder i ever got married and had kids but you know they give you 42 weeks just because i waited until the last week doesnt bother me im elated to be where im at
7203395 i really hit some nice irons coming in including one that skipped past the hole on the ninth but didnt always convert i am just doubting my reads some on my putts i hit what i think are good putts and they arent going in
7203396 i was just awful the past two events a missed cut in the u s senior open and a tie for 52nd at the jeld wen tradition and the 73 in the first round was pretty mediocre
7203397 ive been down on my game so i just wanted to play good golf
7203398 i really got into a nice rhythm with my irons and i just hope that continues sunday
7203399 i dont make nearly as many putts as i used to
7203400 you have a chance for a scholarship in golf and who knows maybe a professional golf career
7203401 ive been wanting to do a boxing scene since i launched this site one year ago i think the idea of two sweaty guys fighting then all of a sudden wanting to fuck each other is just about the hottest premise for a porn video jasper was a perfect cast he could throw a punch just about as good as he could take my big cock id love to have him back wouldnt you
7203402 i putted poorly at the u s senior open and i changed
7203403 that always helps obviously it helps your score and it helps your psyche and everything
7203404 i could have knocked 4 5 shots off the score that i had and it could have been really special buts its nice to be in the hunt
7203405 i probably didnt hit it as good as yesterday but my putter really got hot
7203406 i have no trouble living with the result winning or losing
7203407 better get drunk in a safe loving environment than some trashy party
7203408 i figured that it must have been a slow news week which is hard to believe considering the russians invaded georgia and the olympics were getting started
7203409 we had one arch out of more than 2 000 collapse
7203410 and while it was the 12th largest arch in the park theres many more that are better known than wall arch
7203411 there are still lots of arches to see both in this section of the park and others
7203412 it is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory
7203413 its very clear the 21 year old drinking age will not be enforced at those campuses
7203414 there isnt that much difference in maturity between 21 and 18
7203415 if the age is younger youre getting exposed to it at a younger age and you dont freak out when you get to campus
7203416 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
7203417 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
7203418 im not sure where the dialogue will lead but its an important topic to american families and it deserves a straightforward dialogue
7203419 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
7203420 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
7203421 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
7203422 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
7203423 if you treat students like children theyre going to act like children
7203424 from addressing drinking with students as an issue of responsible choice

7203473 if there is further reduction the government will announce an adjustment
7203474 it does not matter to me whether he wins or loses as far as i am concerned i have my government to look after and to carry on with the work of development whatever the opposition members want to do that is up to them
7203475 we are a strong government and we are determined to make sure we will stay as the government of malaysia until the next general election when we face the people again and let them decide
7203476 i am more concerned with the people working hard meeting the voters and attending to the needs of their constituency
7203477 anything is possible it is possible for him to return to parliament and it is not impossible for him to lose this by election
7203478 if we were unable to handle it the government would have collapsed by now it does not have to wait for anwar
7203479 the people would know what to do with it bn but we still have very strong support the people know we are sincerely doing our work and we will be able to deliver what we promise
7203480 no the bn people love the bn if we have internal problems we solve it among ourselves we dont go running off to other parties
7203481 no we have no business to waste time trying to trump up a case against him
7203482 we have other more important things to do it is his own personal aide who lodged the police report
7203483 it is not for me to judge whether it was necessary this is a matter for him mohd saiful to decide if he feels this is the way he wants to do it let it be
7203484 that is what is important there has been an investigation and surely there must be proof otherwise how can the charge be taken to the courts what the proof is we will all see when the trial starts
7203485 he must have felt that the allegations against him are serious and people seem to keep believing it so he must have been pushed to swear

7203495 ive got nothing to say beyond what ive already said dr nelson said
7203496 the important thing here is that its important that the government prepare and release an economic statement our economy is slowing very sharply
7203497 weve got plummeting business and consumer confidence the reserve bank is forecasting inflation at five per cent in december and the economy has slowed to two per cent growth by the end of the year
7203498 the single most important thing we will be focused on this week is the fact that australians are worse off under mr rudd than they were under the coalition last year

7203521 the world has not forgotten the people of this land today we are all from gaza
7203522 we recognize that were two humble boats but what weve accomplished is to show that average people from around the world can mobilize to create change we do not have to stay silent in the face of injustice reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
7203523 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing
7203524 what weve done shows that people can do what governments should have done if people stand up against injustice we can truly be the conscience of the world
7203525 is that the world is intolerant of the continued israeli siege the act has put pressure on the arab nations and leaders to work harder towards breaking the siege
7203526 this effort that was prepared for two years was able to draw the attention of the public to the unfair siege israel is imposing on the gaza strip and the necessity of ending it
7203527 the electronic systems which guarantee our safety aboard the ss free gaza and ss liberty have been jammed and scrambled both ships are flying greek flags and are in international waters we are the victims of electronic piracy we are currently in gms p area a2 and we are relying on our satellite communications equipment to make a distress call if needed we are civilians from 17 nations and are on this project to break the siege of gaza we are not experienced sailors as a result there is concern about the health and safety of the people on board such an emergency develop we are currently experiencing rough sea conditions and we call on the greek government and the international community to meet their responsibilities and protect the civilians on board our two ships in international waters
7203528 they wanted provocation at sea but they wont get it
7203529 we know who the passengers are and what they are bringing with them and so we have no problem letting them through
7203530 no matter what happens we have already achieved our goal by proving that ordinary citizens with ordinary means can mobilise a defence of human rights for palestinians

7203586 heres to the crazy ones the misfits the rebels the troublemakers the round heads in the square holes the ones who see things differently theyre not fond of rules you can quote them disagree with them glorify or vilify them but the only thing you cant do is ignore them because they change things they push the human race forward and while some may see them as the crazy ones we see genius because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do

7203593 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
7203594 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money

7203596 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
7203597 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased

7203605 the second annual contest held at friendship park was decided in the final inning as dutch scored five runs and then held defensively to insure the victory

7203613 on the return and when just above the park the engine was acting badly and finally stopped
7203614 almost immediately the boat was in flames caused it is thought by a broken live wire coming in contact with the waste oil under the engine
7203615 mr partridge said to him that he was making a bad matter worse and he stopped and working his way to the bow of the boat mr horton held on to the painter
7203616 then removed all his clothing but his pants in readiness to swim if he had to take to the water
7203617 mr horton escaped with a wetting mr gilchrest lost his pocket book and gold sleevelinks and mr partridge was minus his clothes excepting the pants but saved his watch
7203618 had the accident happened farther out in the bay or an explosion taken place loss of life must have ensued
7203619 hello bill she said greeting me and others gathered for a political forum at pasco hernando community college

7203621 the anger the self hatred my inability to form a committed relationship the male bashing
7203622 the tentmaker was going to have to make my clothes she said
7203623 this transformation doesnt mean i wont fall off the wagon but i have more tools in my arsenal now
7203624 im still acquainted with her i hope i never lose contact because she is the reason im so grateful for the blessings i now have she allows me to reach out to help others by sharing this story the pain is still there but now it is not so all consuming i feel like ill make it now
7203625 the court must acknowledge that mr carey has had an exemplary career in the legal profession he enjoys a solid reputation as an honest professional and a civic minded citizen of great integrity
7203626 for this reason deciding the facts and issues in this case has been especially painful and troubling
7203627 should any of the parties have a mind to upset the grand plan they should first check with the other two parties
7203628 this document wreaks of a consciousness of fraud and the court finds it to be persuasive evidence of undue influence
7203629 the agreement is also compelling evidence that the perpetrators knew all of the elements of undue influence were present
7203630 she did those things on her own she was not a weak woman
7203631 she had her own mind and did what she wanted to do
7203632 its not the money its that they are disgracing mrs murphy and what we did for her id rather that mrs murphy not be depicted as a ding a ling or anything else she was a very astute woman
7203633 although i respect judge laughlin i think her decision was not right and did not really deal with virginia murphy as to what she wanted to do under her will
7203634 does it look good no did it really matter no it didnt really deal with her intent
7203635 independent girls do not exist they just think they are independent

7203640 is someone who wont give the neocons the time of the day
7203641 hes very pragmatic he studies a problem and tries to figure out what the interests are and where the solutions will be
7203642 i think it was built on a fundamental misreading of the situation on the ground
7203643 we were searching for what their common ground would be
7203644 i understand that change comes all the time and we all live in a moment of hope
7203645 but it never dawned on me that an african american would get to this point but hey we never know whats going to happen in life
7203646 its all about rallying the troops and building momentum for november and getting people excited about the ticket thats the main point of the convention these days
7203647 ive been trying to recruit for women for obama and some of the people ive talked to say theyre not quite over it yet
7203648 theyre saying were going to be so busy were only going to have time to sleep
7203649 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous
7203650 nothing wrong with that who wouldnt want to be described as such by his or her partner
7203651 it was obviously a failed attempt at humor or perhaps im just a humorless feminist either way one can only hope this isnt a harbinger of gaffes to come
7203652 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 of the time
7203653 i say with every fiber of my being i believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this
7203654 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7203655 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class
7203656 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7203657 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7203658 its nice that you can get a twofer with one of the heaviest hitters on foreign policy in the senate and also get someone who has the capacity to reach these lunch bucket voters
7203659 single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids
7203660 hes still one of the poorest members of the senate
7203661 he came to washington to do good not to do well for himself
7203662 most of those who are disappointed that hillary clinton was chosen will readily concede that joe biden is a solid choice and highly qualified avoiding some of the hard feelings that might have occurred if some of the lesser experienced contenders had been selected
7203663 if its a referendum on obama then the question is much less about how bad bush and mccain are and about how good really is obama
7203664 and thats where the doubts that the republicans have tried to create begin to seep in
7203665 she was able to reach all the spots down low
7203666 its also agents of graces mission to connect churches across denominational racial and social lines and build relationships through service
7203667 i really just enjoyed being out there with the horses ashlynn said
7203668 it felt like such an accomplishment when we got one of the horses to feel comfortable being around us he was new there and was afraid at first
7203669 ive been doing this for a really long time emily 14 said
7203670 its just nice to get joy from doing things for other people
7203671 i was getting frustrated because i told her school is about to start and you have to spell your name
7203672 the staff and dr lathan have achieved so much success
7203673 we cannot afford for our students not to receive those same services for continued growth
7203674 it makes me want to call washington the little school that could
7203675 it is what we want and how we want our children to learn
7203676 i think children can regurgitate a lot of information weve got to find that purpose for learning
7203677 parents who have pulled their kids out have felt that were only teaching the lower level kids and were not teaching the higher level or even the middle level students
7203678 what we fight is the stigma that were not a good school
7203679 i think were the best kept secret in guilford county
7203680 it feels more comfortable being in the school knowing its a magnet program
7203681 a lot of students feel when they graduate from school they have to go away
7203682 thats what has all the alumni and community beaming to know that we have such a wonderful program coming here
7203683 i tell people that you get to know joe biden the closer you get to wilmington del and when you see him with his family then you know the man
7203684 i liked to go at night when i thought there was a better chance of finding a fight
7203685 i was always looking for a fight i had not known i was capable of such rage
7203686 i felt god had played a horrible trick on me
7203687 the rule in the office was if the boys called he was to be interrupted no matter what he was doing or who he was talking to
7203688 if theres one thing that separates happy people from ridiculously happy people its the quality of their social relationships
7203689 every time i got a text message i hoped it was barack
7203690 but when it came down to it i was left out
7203691 weve been using text messaging and e mail from the beginning of the campaign and i think well keep using them as a way to keep our supporters engaged and connected
7203692 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7203693 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7203694 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7203695 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7203696 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7203697 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7203698 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7203699 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7203700 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7203701 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7203702 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7203703 the road to the white house runs through the west
7203704 there has been a major political realignment in the rocky mountain west in the last seven to eight years
7203705 its worked its way up the ballot but has not reached the presidential level
7203706 no politician of either party is going to come out here and say im going to raise your taxes and increase social services
7203707 democrats cant sell new york style massachusetts style union politics out there
7203708 they can sell a new environmentally conscious pragmatic governing style
7203709 these guys would be republicans if they were 500 miles to the east
7203710 this notion that somehow were in some unstoppable democratic trend i think its bunk
7203711 democrats have had a couple of good cycles but that does not mean it is going to maintain itself in 2008 or 2010 and beyond
7203712 have gone from being pretty noncompetitive 20 years ago to becoming contestable
7203713 denver is the perfect perfect host city for the democrats
7203714 colorado is the great democratic story of the last two cycles
7203715 everybody sees a real need for us to reform the way we do this
7203716 its such an emotional issue in those states that its very unlikely thats going to change
7203717 there are certain traditions in politics that are hard to disturb
7203718 this year superdelegates comprised 20 of our national delegation yet the vast majority of the public had no idea what superdelegates were until this year
7203719 the role they played in our nominating process actually distracted us from the important issues we were debating
7203720 whatever your lifes work is do it well a man should do his job so well that the living the dead and the unborn could do it no better if a man is called to be a street sweeper he should sweep streets even as michelangelo painted or beethoven composed music or shakespeare wrote poetry he should sweep streets so well that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say here lived a great street sweeper who did his job well

7203738 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7203739 thats because he is still that scrappy kid from scranton who beat the odds the dedicated family man and committed catholic who knows every conductor on that amtrak train to wilmington
7203740 we are now linked to people who share our faith but who live in another country
7203741 the experience will be beneficial not just to our catholic vietnamese community but with the broader community as well
7203742 vietnamese people in america have education they have jobs they have a better way of life it is easier for them to live out their faith
7203743 in vietnam they are more limited to what they have in terms of finance and that can make them less open minded in terms of practicing our faith
7203744 as vietnam develops it is hard to balance that with making money and having a job in the city and being away from your family and still having your religion grounded
7203745 we are a rural country and traditional society that is changing quickly we dont have experience of living faith in the modern country

7203772 i think that you will find that the british economy is resilient
7203773 we have got to take people through these difficult economic times we have done it before and we will do it again

7203782 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 of the time
7203783 i say with every fiber of my being i believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this
7203784 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7203785 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class
7203786 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7203787 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7203788 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous
7203789 nothing wrong with that who wouldnt want to be described as such by his or her partner
7203790 it was obviously a failed attempt at humor or perhaps im just a humorless feminist either way one can only hope this isnt a harbinger of gaffes to come
7203791 is someone who wont give the neocons the time of the day
7203792 hes very pragmatic he studies a problem and tries to figure out what the interests are and where the solutions will be
7203793 i think it was built on a fundamental misreading of the situation on the ground
7203794 we were searching for what their common ground would be
7203795 i tell people that you get to know joe biden the closer you get to wilmington del and when you see him with his family then you know the man
7203796 i liked to go at night when i thought there was a better chance of finding a fight
7203797 i was always looking for a fight i had not known i was capable of such rage
7203798 i felt god had played a horrible trick on me
7203799 the rule in the office was if the boys called he was to be interrupted no matter what he was doing or who he was talking to
7203800 the road to the white house runs through the west
7203801 there has been a major political realignment in the rocky mountain west in the last seven to eight years
7203802 its worked its way up the ballot but has not reached the presidential level
7203803 no politician of either party is going to come out here and say im going to raise your taxes and increase social services
7203804 democrats cant sell new york style massachusetts style union politics out there
7203805 they can sell a new environmentally conscious pragmatic governing style
7203806 these guys would be republicans if they were 500 miles to the east
7203807 this notion that somehow were in some unstoppable democratic trend i think its bunk
7203808 democrats have had a couple of good cycles but that does not mean it is going to maintain itself in 2008 or 2010 and beyond
7203809 have gone from being pretty noncompetitive 20 years ago to becoming contestable
7203810 denver is the perfect perfect host city for the democrats
7203811 colorado is the great democratic story of the last two cycles
7203812 its nice that you can get a twofer with one of the heaviest hitters on foreign policy in the senate and also get someone who has the capacity to reach these lunch bucket voters
7203813 single mom who had to struggle to support her son and her kids
7203814 hes still one of the poorest members of the senate
7203815 he came to washington to do good not to do well for himself
7203816 most of those who are disappointed that hillary clinton was chosen will readily concede that joe biden is a solid choice and highly qualified avoiding some of the hard feelings that might have occurred if some of the lesser experienced contenders had been selected
7203817 if its a referendum on obama then the question is much less about how bad bush and mccain are and about how good really is obama
7203818 and thats where the doubts that the republicans have tried to create begin to seep in
7203819 if you want to come here illegally and live in this country do not violate any laws
7203820 but we have the legal responsibility to act on allegations of a felony crime
7203821 everything absolutely everything i have done has been for this
7203822 you will be an amazing role model of excellence and fearlessness for the young gay athletes who follow you
7203823 i just want to be known as the australian diver who did really well at the olympics
7203824 its everybody else who thinks its special when homosexuality and elite sports go together
7203825 it must have been so hard to believe that you could beat the chinese but you did then went out there and did it
7203826 definitely the best medal of the olympics for australia for me nothing can top that in my books
7203827 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7203828 these rights are protected by chinas own constitution and by international human rights standards to which china has agreed
7203829 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7203830 i am very happy because i won the first boxing gold medal for my country
7203831 after a very good preparation i wanted to deliver to the spectators but i did not expect that my opponent would get injured
7203832 i told myself when you get gold you can cry
7203833 we cannot repeat these regrets looking back on the past five decades we can see that taiwan and china can have war or peace can fight or compete can isolate oneself or cooperate the two sides have paid terrible price for this lesson
7203834 in the short term the two sides should broaden exchanges and cooperation to reduce hostility and lay the foundation for peace
7203835 i must remind them that taiwan and china have wasted half a century in confrontation
7203836 we have found a letter from the spot which indicates that it may be a maoists attack
7203837 there are instances where the rebels have threatened hindu temples here
7203838 one sings and the other beats you to death kind of a rough combination id say
7203839 i think these guys got my brain and ears stoned
7203840 lets make sure that nobody physically sees any of the bands they paid a bazillion dollars to see
7203841 het blijkt dat de meeste overtredingen zijn veroorzaakt door een paar veelvoorkomende vergissingen die eenvoudig voorkomen kunnen worden
7203842 we willen de gemeenschap van commerci le distributeurs en wederverkopers opleiden zodat zij overtredingen kunnen voorkomen en dat zij op adequate wijze kunnen reageren wanneer overtredingen zich voordoen
7203843 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
7203844 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
7203845 to mention anything concerning a person that he would dislike
7203846 your brother and i have fallen in love we are going to alaska im sorry
7203847 thats why we are putting a 20 year moratorium on all mining activities bulk sampling and exploration over the mcfarlane deposit in the whitsunday region
7203848 the governments oft promoted support for the industries generating queenslands wealth seems to have become hostage to the guerrilla tactics of fringe groups like greenpeace mr roche said
7203849 what next greenpeace resource sector target will have the queensland government folding under a tiny bit of pressure
7203850 this proposal should never have been given serious consideration greenpeace climate campaigner john hepburn said
7203851 ms bligh has made the right decision to prevent any new shale oil projects from taking place in the state but it is an easy decision the next step is to announce a stop the expansion of the coal industry in queensland mr hepburn said
7203852 queensland energy resources proposal came at a time when the worlds scientists are warning that we have as little as 10 years to radically reduce greenhouse pollution if we are to have any chance of avoiding catastrophic climate change bugatti veyron
7203853 ok now im going to tell a funny story its called the pit and the pendulum
7203854 jusqu aujourdhui ce qui avait t annonc publiquement ne se traduit pas dans les faits ce qui soul ve un certain nombre de questions
7203855 ils ont fait cette annonce pour le monde ext rieur mais lint rieur du pays ils r priment la population
7203856 ils ont en fait ralenti le travail en cours et provoqu laugmentation des abus
7203857 la strat gie adopt e par p kin pour la pr paration des jeux a t d radiquer toutes les voix critiques en les emp chant de r percuter un message dans les m dias internationaux

7203862 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7203863 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7203864 they keep talking about rivalries we might have one now
7203865 he did it at milwaukee and hes done it a few other times its just his normal fashion thats fine ive grown to know that now
7203866 to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners chatters his very tires is what he did i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny hamlin got to his outside and he got by me and then i had to battle with him towards the end we were as clean as could be of course but just one other dude we had a problem with
7203867 a real smart racer explained it to me this way after he wrecked me and i was really mad
7203868 he said i just had to look at your rear bumper and decide would you do this to me and you had before so it was a real simple decision
7203869 earlier this year we had a nationwide race and kyle was a lot faster than me and he went ahead and got to my back bumper of my car and sent me up the racetrack
7203870 so thats the way it went and thats the decision i made and id do it again
7203871 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7203872 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7203873 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7203874 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7203875 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7203876 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7203877 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7203881 thousands of california children are likely to lose health insurance coverage they now have
7203882 weve gone from being characterized as environmental terrorists to being embraced this is like falling down a rabbit hole i feel like alice in wonderland
7203883 its been unbelievable to me that this has happened but this isnt my victory i just sat on guard
7203884 we hope to duplicate the things we do well one county away
7203885 the intent is to operate with a high standard of environmental stewardship
7203886 is someone who wont give the neocons the time of the day
7203887 hes very pragmatic he studies a problem and tries to figure out what the interests are and where the solutions will be
7203888 i think it was built on a fundamental misreading of the situation on the ground
7203889 we were searching for what their common ground would be
7203890 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 of the time

7203892 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7203893 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class
7203894 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7203895 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7203896 this has not been a policy priority for this country for the last 40 years
7203897 there was an underlying assumption that as soon as economic growth takes place this will vanish so lets focus on economic growth lets focus on getting rich
7203898 maybe we didnt treat it like a crisis earlier which we should have then we would have taken corrective steps much earlier than now and what were thinking of doing now we shouldve started 10 years back
7203899 its not nice to want to have an international role and then find that youre having to defend such an indefensible position
7203900 i tell people that you get to know joe biden the closer you get to wilmington del and when you see him with his family then you know the man
7203901 i liked to go at night when i thought there was a better chance of finding a fight
7203902 i was always looking for a fight i had not known i was capable of such rage
7203903 i felt god had played a horrible trick on me
7203904 the rule in the office was if the boys called he was to be interrupted no matter what he was doing or who he was talking to
7203905 time for a change we are the people we can do it
7203906 this is the first election where ive actually paid attention to every single thing and i think its because im a mom now
7203907 i just think barack is amazing i admire him i admire his wife michelle
7203908 i think hes inspirational and thats what this country needs right now
7203909 it was the worst start of a tournament ever because we were all so close to them
7203910 but everyone knew the way we could have made them happy it was to go out and play the best way we could possibly play
7203911 and that we came as far as we did i hope people watched at home i hope they saw how this is a true team i hope girls back home saw it this is not just any other game its a world thing you know were here to inspire young kids we never stopped fighting
7203912 were in touch with her by e mail joines said

7203914 i play better i just kind of go on my emotions
7203915 the usa team is the best weve seen in the last four years
7203916 but weve got to think about what we really did we accomplished a lot
7203917 each day we provide government business and home users with guidance and advice on their technology choices
7203918 from the starting point i think of the way to win the gold
7203919 i dont think about the time from that point i push it push it push it
7203920 i remembered all the guys who would love to be in my shoes right now
7203921 both conventions are unusually late and theres usually a period of a few weeks in between
7203922 this is one of the few opportunities apart from the debates that they have to get a large free audience and they get to frame their agendas in the most favourable terms possible
7203923 john mccain has been very effective in turning obamas ability to attract large crowds into a negative by deriding obama as mile high but an inch deep
7203924 well i can now announce that tom and i are expecting a baby and we are very happy
7203925 ill be taking it easy ill need some time off to be a mum but before you know it well be back
7203926 weve got some of our younger kids from here of course dt frank okam is from the dallas area so i think those guys know fs dominique barber has got his brother i was just teasing him in front of the team about his brother so i think they kind of know it will be a nice stage i like our preseason weve played in a couple of places where the environment has been real i thought it was very good in new orleans that night im sure it will be loud in dallas this friday its been good for our team as we get ready for the season
7203927 the fact that youre at the highest level of football and to be able to be on the field at the same time as my brother id be speechless it would be a dream come true but id just go out there and play football
7203928 coach hoke told him dont call your brother and give him the plays but you dont know him anyway laughs no its got to be exciting for him as a kid im sure he looks up to his brother his brothers a great player and to be on the same field with him im sure will be pretty special
7203929 it would be cool but our relationship that we have its not about who beats up who
7203930 he was never the type of guy to beat me up as the older brother but if i could get a nice little lick on him that would be nice
7203931 they are just as my dad would put it hes just happy to be here he supports us both my parents we have great parents they raised us right and they are proud of us theres actually one more hes only ten we dont know where he is going to be at but we both think hes the athlete of the family
7203932 even if its briefly hey how ya doing hows your body just little things like that we talk everyday and we have a great relationship and im excited to see him on friday

7204113 i told wulff from the beginning i was thinking about leaving depending on my draft grade

7204117 you get back a mid round grade you can go anywhere you can go as high as two as low as six it all depends on your 40 time and i didnt want to leave it up to a 40 time i didnt feel if i got drafted in the seventh round id be happy with myself

7204129 we often forget how much posture affects how we look and feel as well as how it influences how people perceive us everyone is afraid of developing a pooch or beer belly but we dont realize the role poor posture can play in that
7204130 posture directly affects how tall and thin we look and how confident we appear to others but we are all so busy we hardly have time to think about it the iposture is designed to do the thinking for us
7204131 while we were working on the book i realized that improving posture requires a multi pronged approach and i wanted to create a device that could help people improve their posture as they go about their day thats when the idea for the iposture was born

7204134 some gps say it is just a nightmare to use the technology as not a week goes by without it breaking down
7204135 others want to write themselves to a consultant they know has a special interest in an area
7204136 we are disappointed that currently only 27pc of patient bookings are being made directly since we are committed as an nhs organisation to making sure that people in suffolk have the best possible choice of hospital supported by their gps and by good modern technology
7204137 we know that we have the support of gps and the hospitals for our ambition to double this percentage and are working hard to remove technical problems
7204138 we do not regularly analyse or publish information on choices made through choose and book by individual patients or by practice but in overall terms we have not seen any significant changes in the pattern of activity in the county with the very great majority of patients being seen at local hospitals
7204139 we are not merely marbles in a bucket autonomous beings who happen to be in the same place at the same time each of whom are capable of living whole and healthy lives by themselves we are cells in a body each giving something to the body which it needs and each receiving from the other cells in that body what we need to sustain our lives
7204140 it seems we face in our culture a fundamental zealous commitment to individualism in some ways this is what has made the u s a successful nation but i suspect it has broken a lot of things in other ways it certainly doesnt epitomize the values of gods kingdom living out the gospel of the kingdom is trying to put into practice the good news of what will eventually take over the entire universe
7204141 it affected both countries and most players did not play to their abilities because of the heat
7204142 i dont think it was a good idea to play at noon
7204143 it wasnt the same spectacle it could have been if it was played at night it was very very hot
7204144 i knew even before we got here that this would be a worthwhile experience
7204145 thats why i fought so hard to come here and i am grateful for my club for letting me i wanted to be with my teammates and experience the olympics i never doubted i would be here and everything worked out we got what we came here for living in the village was a thrill meeting great sports stars like kobe bryant we have to enjoy the moment im super happy and its an experience ill never forget
7204146 it can definitely go down to the last race its quite possible

7204151 ive watched caseys career from the time he first came in and hes always impressed me
7204152 im a team player and thats how i like to race
7204153 there were things we had to put on the back burner that have come forward now that everything is said and done
7204154 she told us when shes able to talk to the team through e mail it brings a smile to her face
7204155 we just felt we had to uplift her and her family with volleyball that family loves and supports volleyball more than anyone else
7204156 the stadium will be electrifying because of the way its situated with the ceiling
7204157 theyll be able to create a real nice atmosphere here
7204158 its one of the best turf surfaces weve played on
7204159 its a lot of fun playing in front of a crowd that knows what theyre talking about they chant they know when to cheer they know when a good play happens
7204160 seattles a big soccer town the atmospheres going to be great here next year
7204161 ive always thought that the sounders were the class of the usl
7204162 i thought it was just a matter of time before they got included in the mls i think the majority of their players could play in mls
7204163 you have to stay calm on the outside for the kids you dont want to panic
7204164 robby was kind of celebrating so i thought he had won it
7204165 i had my head down and i was just trying to squeeze the last ounces i could get out of my horse
7204166 it never feels good to lose i just got beat
7204167 i had a little bit more confidence tonight and especially when one of your first runs is a big run it builds confidence
7204168 the initial x rays were negative about any serious damage
7204169 at the time i didnt think it was going to be
7204170 id be lying if i said i wasnt but im also very anxious and very excited
7204171 it was always in the back of my mind that i wanted to play college football that it was my dream
7204172 but it didnt really start to unravel until i was a free agent in november at the time i thought i was going to sign back with the pirates and get a chance to go to aa but that didnt really turn out the way i wanted so i decided to pursue my dream
7204173 no regrets i did everything i could i worked hard just one of those things that didnt work out
7204174 i you tubed him and found his highlight tape and said man this guy is playing for us
7204175 he has been a pro baseball player a pro athlete so he came in this spring and did some good things and just let his natural ability flow
7204176 he has some ability now its just a matter of picking up the defense and everything hes a smart kid so im pleased with his progress right now
7204177 it took me a while to figure things out and spot different formations and different tendencies in the offense
7204178 it took me a while to kind of get my mind back in football mode but its coming along and im starting to see things now before they happen and my instincts are coming back
7204179 he kind of stays in his own world im just happy to have him part of the team hes going to make some things happen i can feel it
7204180 its just unlike any other closing ceremony ive ever seen
7204181 we will not compete with the chinese ceremony it will be simple youthful athletic loud and proud like london entertaining and fun
7204182 we are dedicated to creating a happy atmosphere at the closing ceremony
7204183 i give anne a lot of credit because one thing she said was we may not have the best defenders as individuals but as a team we can put it together and get it done
7204184 the very first meeting the very first moment we were together she told the team you have to buy in to how were going to play defensively if you want to win gold
7204185 that tape she showed of what happened in brazil it was there stark naked for everyone to see
7204186 she made them understand that if we were going to win we had to defend
7204187 shes a very detailed person and this team needed that kind of leadership as we moved forward
7204188 i cant say enough great things about what she did with this group
7204189 nobody has done more for usa womens basketball than anne donovan
7204190 shes so passionate about the game shes a tremendous teacher and she has a great feel for the pulse of the team and what they need she cares so much about the people who play the game and she just works her tail off
7204191 if anyone knows what its like to be where we are as players its anne
7204192 annes been a player shes been in and won gold medal games shes won championships shes played overseas
7204193 she knows what its like she knows what to expect and she knows how to get the best out of every one of us
7204194 as a pitcher you never want to come out of a game
7204195 i wasnt unbelievably shocked that i was coming out i was just pretty frustrated with how id performed more than anything
7204196 todays another game where one bad pitch cost me a loss
7204197 i thought he was a little upset about being taken out of the game
7204198 i explained to him that this was not the time to be upset with me you have to pitch better than that if you want to stay in the game my comments to him were pretty mild but i reminded him that i had a tough call there to make and i needed to make it
7204199 we with all the right intentions sat him longer than we should have
7204200 and it just seems from that point on that he hasnt been as sharp as he should be
7204201 you always want to see your team win and its frustrating when we dont
7204202 but im trying to stay positive and to finish strong
7204203 i dont think it makes a whole lot of sense for me to push it to get back unless thats the case
7204204 we had the one day friday where it kind of came back thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better the treatment and stuff is definitely working
7204205 the doctors say its going to help so were going with it
7204206 brett anderson pitched a great ballgame he had some trouble in the second and third innings gave up some home runs then he settled down and really won the game for us
7204207 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners
7204208 i had to push the pace because my body gets tired when i slow down
7204209 its going to take a while to sink in my cheeks hurt from smiling my face hurts from the chlorine my legs are sore from jumping up and down im in pain and im tired but im so happy
7204210 its absolutely surreal i never thought that this would be possible i wasnt even really sure of my medal chances at all after i did my last dive and i saw i was in first im like thats it its a silver medal im so happy with this and then i cant believe it im so happy
7204211 it has been a long journey since our decision in july 2001 to bring the olympic games to china but there can now be no doubt that we made the right choice rogge said sunday on the final day of the games
7204212 the world has learned about china and china has learned about the world and i believe this is something that will have positive effects for the long term rogge said
7204213 we are first and foremost an organization devoted to sport but it is sport with a purpose rogge said in a speech to the ioc general assembly
7204214 the ioc and the olympic games cannot force changes on sovereign nations or solve all the ills of the world but we can and we do contribute to positive change through sport
7204215 some of the changes in china are obvious today he said
7204216 others will become apparent with time the legacy of these games for china is ultimately up to the chinese people
7204217 it is clear that china has put the bar very high he said at a news conference
7204218 so its going to be a challenge for london and all the subsequent games i believe and my hope will be london can even put the bar higher
7204219 perfect for media access to the internet during the beijing games and expressed surprise that no citizen protest permits had been granted
7204220 we found it unusual that none of these applications have come through rogge said adding the ioc was told the cases had been resolved through
7204221 we heard about these cases and we discussed them with bocog rogge said referring to the local olympic organizing committee
7204222 the reply we received from the chinese authorities this was an application of chinese law the international olympic committee is not a sovereign organization we have to respect chinese law
7204223 yes of course i have been criticized for various issues said rogge who has been accused of being out of touch
7204224 the bolt issue i mean i take it with a big smile
7204225 i said that he was the icon of the games together with michael phelps i have great respect for his abilities i thought that and i repeat what i said he should show more respect for his opponents but ive also said in the same way he was a young man of 22 and that he has time to mature
7204226 mr carroll will proceed to set the process in place and will contact you in due course to advise you of progress
7204227 given that my family are making formal allegations of a conspiracy to cover up bias bullying tampering manipulation and misconduct by det staff in various departments your absence is of a concern to us as your absence would give ample opportunity for another to access the documents and change or prepare information i note that with regard to foi 07 384 you have extended th time until the 18th january 2008 this date is during the period that you will be on leave i would therefore formally request that all information documents already in your possession be forwarded to me before you take leave and that all remaining information documents be held in signed sealed envelopes in safe keeping so that nobody except you can have access to the documents and or deals with this foi application i appreciate that this might delay my application by another week but i believe that the measures are necessary due ot the serious allegations made against departmental staff
7204228 mr carroll will proceed to set the process in place and will contact you in due course to advise you of progress
7204229 mrs challita has been declared a vexatious correspondent for the purpose of ministerial
7204230 she was declared vexatious for the purpose of ministerial correspondence and any subsequent ministerial correspondence from her is filed without response dated march 2006 but all those documents are reporting the vexatious
7204231 i therefore seek an urgent appointment to attend to speak to the minister for education mr john della bosca in relation to these serious issues and allegations so as to show the minister in person that the department is not telling the truth and so as to have this matter dealt with and resolved
7204232 responding to allegations and complaints policy see attached and that i would be contacted in relation to same i was not contacted and this investigation has never taken place
7204233 there are 26 061 students including the non selective streams enrolled in selective and partially selective schools
7204234 one of the myths is that the bright kids will make it in any environment when the research shows these are the very kids who will drop out and get clinically depressed and have all sorts of difficulties if they arent in a group with their intellectual and emotional peers they will mask their abilities and come down to the level of the others the three children have iq test results ranging from 147 161 these scores identify the students as gifted but they do not form the basis for opportunity class and selective high school entry
7204235 they are all against me they are wrong im right its a coverup conspiracy victimisation
7204236 the public system is run by people who do not give a damn about our children
7204237 my children qualified for distance education on psychological and medical grounds
7204238 oh god this sort of conspiracy theorist is the absolute worst sort of client you could ever get as a solicitor because no matter what you ever did for her when her hopeless claims failed shed just try and complain to everyone she could and accuse them of all sorts of things
7204239 he just was concerned and he wanted to make sure he didnt have anything to do with it
7204240 but the all star game was just another step in the process being a lefty specialist and only getting 40 whatever innings the last few years and then all of the sudden having 50 already its just that on top of everything else
7204241 i dont think we were disrespectful or ignorant of him i do understand that now hes on the dl so i called him
7204242 i dont want to see a kid go on the dl anyway not if i have something to do with it but i dont want them to go on the dl anyway
7204243 katie hoff with her three swimming medals and michael phelps with his eight golds call the same baltimore suburb home
7204244 if towson md were a country it would rank among the top 20 medal winners
7204245 what is so modern about sword fighting and target practice
7204246 granted if vince mcmahon gets his hands on the sport and has the participants turn the swords and guns on each other it would be a pay per view bonanza
7204247 do maple leafs games count in the s amp m category
7204248 hes so fast hes literally invisible to american viewers until 13 hours after he finishes
7204249 his hair looks like it was cut with a soup can lid
7204250 this just is the center of soccer in the northwest today starfire
7204251 and so assuming we get all the arrangements in place and we actually are here on a permanent basis there isnt a better fit as far as im concerned in terms of where sounders fc should have their home base
7204252 its a great opportunity for the greater community in south seattle what were really trying to do is make sure kids arent left out couple that with sounders fc players in the same facility to have kids be able to be that close thats going to be cool
7204253 for a player being close to the airport and team travel its a good location
7204254 its wherever you can get the best deal and you can get good games usually teams will go to the same venue so they can play each other
7204255 i never really considered anywhere else as a home for the team
7204256 to end it with an olympic record after everything those guys have been through that shows you they care about representing america
7204257 they wanted to end it with a good dose of good ol american apple pie
7204258 so we used that as motivation we kept our heads high and we ran great
7204259 the boys ran a good race they ran a tough race bekele took charge he seems like he was having an easy day today
7204260 the good thing about tennis this year is that you have many players who are winning some major events
7204261 its a bigger competition its more attractive for the fans
7204262 i know there are some hungry guys desperate to make some type of mark
7204263 you dont ever know when youre going to see the beginning of the end
7204264 when you lose a little bit of that swagger guys in any sport pick up on that
7204265 ive enjoyed it talking about it being compared to the greatest
7204266 its a nice challenge beating the next generation trying to play for a long time trying to stay healthy trying to beat records
7204267 when he came in as coach in 2005 he decided we werent going to settle for being maybe a contender he got the guys into good training facilities and good teams overseas he instilled a new philosophy of working hard and together with no superstars and picking each other up everyone bought into it
7204268 it is not really mainly a budget thing anymore but more about conservation and that argument is what is keeping this going along the path that it is going down
7204269 we are currently working on information needed to let the public know what were thinking and why regarding our plans for this facility
7204270 we should have a news release ready in a couple of weeks with some public meetings to follow
7204271 he did his job and represented himself his club and the state as a real gentleman and very professionally he has a great future in competitive bass fishing or anything else he plans on doing
7204272 i fished hard all day and missed only one opportunity that could possibly have made the difference
7204273 it isnt true that no people can be gifted in all areas
7204274 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
7204275 its about colin barnett and the liberal team in western australia making sure they take it well and truly up to mr carpenter in the next two weeks
7204276 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album

7204278 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
7204279 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now
7204280 was released at the end of june 2005 and featured remixes from jj flores and peter bailey
7204281 you make me want to be a man bloodshy amp avant mix
7204282 you make me want to be a man junior jack mix
7204283 they were always sharp and motivated and defended very well and we didnt create enough chances to win the game
7204284 in the first half in midfield we were dominated and not strong or quick enough and we suffered
7204285 stockholm was in scandinavia it was my first tournament title and it was smaller than this
7204286 here its the tournament before the u s open and its a really big tournament
7204287 many of the united states players have ended their olympic careers on a sour and lasting note
7204288 miss pitou i understand that you came in second im sorry
7204289 yes but dont feel too badly tomorrow youll have another opportunity to win the gold
7204290 its something that i think if we were in a different part of the season and the standings he would pitch through it

7204295 the florida department of transportation fdot plans to open a new ramp from eastbound interstate 4 to downtown orlando during the early morning hours of friday aug 22 although weather conditions resulting from tropical storm fay may delay the opening to as late as wednesday aug 27 the new ramp is a gateway to the heart of downtown orlando at garland avenue and south street allowing easier access to existing and future downtown businesses residences and cultural venues drivers on eastbound i 4 will reach the new exit ramp about a half mile sooner than the existing temporary left exit ramp to south street exit 82c when the new ramp opens the left exit ramp closes permanently the new exit 82b is located just after the sr 408 exit the city of orlando held a dedication ceremony to celebrate completion of the new ramp aug 21 at 10 a m before the ramp officially opens to the public the dedication ceremony was held on the ramp just south of south street participants included fdot district five secretary noranne downs orange county mayor richard crotty orlando mayor buddy dyer and orlando economic development department director frank billingsley several members of the church street merchants association were also on hand for the event
7204296 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7204297 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7204298 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7204299 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7204300 we are truly grateful to edwin because this could have never happened without him
7204301 there was just no way we would have ever been able to raise the money
7204302 esta medalla me deja m s contento que la de c1 1000
7204303 i hope there will be a team by 2012 it will be team uk i hope we can get an agreement on that
7204304 i am determined to work with the football associations and the olympic committee to ensure that when we come to 2012 we have a mens football team and we have a womens football team playing
7204305 this is a spectacular own goal for brown he is out of touch with the overwhelming views of football supporters throughout the uk
7204306 all the national supporters groups oppose this move and see it as a threat to the status of their nations to field independent football squads
7204307 estoy un poco decepcionado mi objetivo era igualar la actuaci n de barcelona92 cuatro medallas y nos hemos quedado en ninguna pero yo no hablo de fracaso esto es una decepci n no un fracaso decir fracaso es exagerar a m no me gusta

7204312 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7204313 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7204314 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down
7204315 there is such a terrific spirit about the place and among the players and that spirit will really help us go so far
7204316 it was a good game it ebbed and flowed we had our good moments in the match and they had their good moments
7204317 but it was a fantastic atmosphere today which helped the players and we have got to make that a regular occurrence here
7204318 i am still very positive because the fact is we have been beaten in the last minute of the game
7204319 over the whole period i thought we should have got at least something from the game after we scored two very good goals
7204320 it is too early to start cutting up players as it were we have played two games in the premier league and weve scored six goals so scoring doesnt seem to be our problem at the moment we scored a lot of goals last season and conceded quite a number
7204321 life is not a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in a pretty and well preserved body but rather to skid in broadside thoroughly used up totally worn out and loudly proclaiming wow what a ride
7204322 that is a very interesting question you should ask the club
7204323 he didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him so he did not play
7204324 well have to wait and see well speak to the player and then well make a decision on his future
7204325 we wont be dancing in the streets in sunderland for beating tottenham away from home well have a cup of tea and sandwich as normal
7204326 we fancy our chances and were happy with the progress were making players showed the other side to them the character of the players is there for everyone to see we have that and you can criticise in other areas but not character
7204327 we were not sharp enough in the first half and our passing was certainly not as good as we expect it to be i dont know why
7204328 you have to give credit to fulham they played very well and they started sharper than us
7204329 we dominated the second half but i felt in the last 25 minutes we were too nervous and wanted to just hit the ball up there rather than create a chance
7204330 we paid a big price for the mistake on their goal we should be able to cope with a corner when it comes in at low level like that
7204331 you are right that is a fact but we have to face it because from all our possession we could not produce many chances frankly the performance was just not good enough
7204332 at night a lot of the flowers have scents that come out so i can smell them while im in the hot tub
7204333 there was a kitty that was hiding at the shelter and we named her shiloh because she was so shy
7204334 the last adoption was dandy his name was crusty at the shelter because hed come in someone had seen him thrown from a van and he had all of these sores and scabs so the staff named him crusty we changed his name to dandy because he was the perfect cat and he got a perfect home
7204335 the first step is to look online and talk with shelter staff about what youre looking for
7204336 its easy to let them go because you know you can rescue another one you get over it pretty fast as much as you love them going on to a new home is the focus
7204337 i was really nervous at first because i always thought of new york as a big crazy place and it turned out the same as i expected
7204338 i didnt really start getting serious about it until i was 12
7204339 its just always stuck with me and grown on me and ive grown to love it its a big part of my life
7204340 when i got to do my sightseeing was on the weekends
7204341 it was so hard ive never really been away from my family for longer than a week
7204342 i was really upset because i wanted to come home after class and tell them how my day went and be with them im really family oriented it was sad because i got to see all these cool things in new york and i didnt have my family to see them with
7204343 theres a lot of stimulation in new york sometimes you wonder if its good for you to have that much stimulation every day
7204344 in the future when ive had more training id like to go over there and see if i can get into a company itd be nice to go back
7204345 there were some really cool teachers and choreographers there its a lot different from what you can get in bellingham
7204346 at that point certain styles had to go with everything
7204347 and now it seems like a lot of things can go with everything
7204348 its going to be really interesting to see how this plays into fashion
7204349 there are a lot of mixing and matching with decades
7204350 there are a lot of options for a lot of different body types
7204351 ive noticed a lot of kind of fancy but skater looks
7204352 like a waistcoat and tie but just going out to caps
7204353 the high waist is coming down a few inches and the bell is coming in
7204354 its more of a straight leg with a minor flair
7204355 leggings have been so huge and skinny jeans have been so huge
7204356 looking ahead at whats on the runways the heels are getting higher and higher
7204357 i literally saw a pair with a seven inch heel with a two inch platform on the internet
7204358 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7204359 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7204360 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7204361 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7204362 simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7204363 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7204364 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7204365 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7204366 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7204367 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7204368 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7204369 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7204428 could you do me a favor would you like to take a few with this one as well
7204429 in a free country people can kiss on the street
7204430 wasnt it you who worried all the time about the danger for the kids
7204431 the boiler is a fact now admit it youll never going to use it again
7204432 hes the one who warmed me in that tiny little kitchen of mom and dad
7204433 you have a unique opportunity here at cook honors college
7204434 you can get achievement grants so any student can get paid for a nonpaid internship
7204435 they have to see it from an objective point of view the class work choosing a major and having an internship students are responsible for getting the internship its important to reach freshman with the news that they absolutely need an internship
7204436 arts are important for teaching us how to think but they are also helpful in transforming peoples outlook on life and understanding of people around them this is important for more reasons than ultimate success in a career or college but for individual human needs the things i learn in college are valuable to me as a person as much as they are to to me as a future contributing member of society
7204437 i wanted to do research into internships about physics and mathematics look up career options in my fields of interest and i finally started to think of reasons to acquire enhancement fund money
7204438 had mr asher not come and done his presentation i feel i may have graduated and been one of those one out of six students who take a job that does not require college
7204439 its incredibly satisfying to know that something you say could change a students life forever
7204440 this particular generation feels they need to hurry and they have this rush to have certainty
7204441 most people discover how to get a ph d about half way through it
7204442 we teach them before they apply how to do it figure it out before you start and if you take time before graduate school or starting a career that is okay too
7204443 take the experience of all your teachers and instructors and it can make a difference in your future
7204444 ray got a bunch of good ideas from mr asher he also liked the attitude don had josh liked don ashers lecture it was informative knowledgeable and engaging overall he found it helpful to be reminded of many things hes heard from core professors
7204445 dara thought the most intriguing idea presented by mr asher was the idea that one should pass benefits one has on to others it is a philosophy dara has been taught since childhood and has always been especially fond of perhaps if more people ascribed to this philosophy the world would be a happier place
7204446 asher thinks highly of the honors college and i am glad he writes about it so other people who would benefit from school and life here can learn about it
7204447 the presentation was invaluable to me i now want to do research on where i can go with my passion for math and mechanical physics i want to go places to apply those passions to entertainment specifically in the hollywood stunt business or in sports entertainment hopefully the information i gained today and the information i intend to seek and apply will lead me to the success that mr asher described
7204448 there is something magic that is going on at rechc its like the tone you get by running your finger around the rim of fine crystal a lot of wine glasses look like crystal but then there is not that rich and satisfying tone rechc is fine crystal and a lot of places that look similar are just glass
7204449 we are telling the farc that they no longer have a claim on us

7204453 indian mujahideen is the identity assumed by a group of hardliners who alienated themselves from students islamic movement of india simi earlier in 2007 after that the members have organized several camps across the nation however at that time no specific name was given to the group
7204454 we were suspecting terror operative of huji jaish e mohammed and simi from the onset however one line of investigation also believed that the organization recruited operatives from various organizations however the puzzle has now been solved with the confession of ahmedabad blast accused
7204455 but one cant deny more members using the alias indian mujahideen we are yet to lay our hands on the senior members to know more about the name and who adopted it there are many members at large working for the terror setup exposed in ahmedabad further investigation will reveal more about their plans
7204456 he has poured his heart and soul into this over the last few years
7204457 im really glad he was here to experience this with us
7204458 but she didnt mention the owl theory at first so im thinking shes a nut case and what does this have to do with me

7204460 im just infuriated that people are so stupid that theyd convict someones who not guilty
7204461 the more i learned about it the more i thought oh my god i can help get this guy out of prison
7204462 an owl didnt kill anyone but it certainly could have been involved in this death
7204463 itll be a tough sell to reopen the case but when you see all of the little bits of evidence it all points to an owl
7204464 howdy folks you may have heard tell that im runnin for guvner again well its true and

7204470 ill tell ya when that danged washington d c lobbyist poked his head under there and offered to help fix it it got me boilin mad

7204479 were a nonpartisan coalition of nonprofit womens organizations working state wide to educate and mobilize low income women and their allies in the democratic process
7204480 theres still a lot of work left to be done
7204481 the bank sincerely regrets this situation and apologizes to its customers for any inconvenience and concern this has caused
7204482 this is the first time this has ever happened to me in 44 years of banking
7204483 i was going to make it into kind of a roman soldier with wings then i thought this would be a little more pleasing
7204484 if i could make a living out of it i would
7204485 i took a chain saw out and started roughing out the big parts
7204486 my neighbors are really good about me running my chain saw
7204487 i didnt plan it that way if i had my druthers i would have just done it in my backyard but the tree is where it is
7204488 the tree was just kind of part of the family
7204489 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7204490 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7204491 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7204492 hes that unique public servant who is at home in a bar in cedar rapids and the corridors of the capitol in the vfw hall in concord and at the center of an international crisis
7204493 a long process but it always pointed in bidens direction
7204494 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7204495 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are rooted firmly in the middle class
7204496 you cant change america and make things better for our senior citizens when you signed on to bushs scheme of privatizing social security
7204497 you cant change america and end this war in iraq when you declare and again these are johns words no one has supported president bush in iraq more than i have end of quote
7204498 senator biden was mentored by one of montanas own great leaders mike mansfield
7204499 mansfield who worked in the mines of butte before becoming a senator understood the value of hard work and knew what a dollar was worth so does joe biden
7204500 in montana where straight talk is what we expect from a neighbor friend or someone running for office senator biden wont disappoint
7204501 washington is full of yes men and the last thing this country needs is another one so i commend barack obama for choosing senator biden
7204502 joe learned well the importance of honoring the values of working families from his mentor montanas mike mansfield whose senate seat i am honored to hold a dedicated family man biden has never lost touch with the working folks who make this country great while leading the way in the senate
7204503 the only issue with the va has always been getting in the door
7204504 for the vast majority of veterans theyre happy with it once they get in the door
7204505 like any bureaucracy there are so many rules and regulations
7204506 a lot of people dont understand them and get a lot of hearsay about them it can be difficult to see beyond that once you get into the system its ok but to get in that system it can be difficult
7204507 shed leave her grade book or papers behind shed run out of gas because she forgot to put gas in her car
7204508 she would be late coming home and say i got lost that scares you eileen was born and raised in this town
7204509 every time i get up in the morning i go in to check to see if she is still breathing
7204510 its constant stress and anxiety a lot of times the caregiver dies before the patient dies
7204511 but we still have tons of people who dont know were here
7204512 thats why research is so important they are on the cusp of finding a cure the future is promising but they are still a ways away
7204513 as a private physician theres a lot of issues about running a business dealing with insurance companies or getting paid
7204514 that is not something that i was trained for nor do i have an interest in i really feel like at the va you get to come here and be a doctor and you went to medical school to be a doctor
7204515 it takes a load off my shoulders that im not being told that i have to produce certain numbers
7204516 i can tell you the last several years i spent in private practice most physicians were unhappy
7204517 more bureaucracy more overhead more meetings about money its just sort of discouraging ive heard many physicians in private practice today say if they could do something else and make about the same money they would quit
7204518 you get to come in you get to take care of patients
7204519 you dont have to worry about paying the staff paying the rent all that other stuff that comes with private practice you get to concentrate on patient care
7204520 good morning and welcome for another year at the university of montana especially you who have recently joined us
7204521 we think your decision to accept our invitation manifests the same uncommon good sense we demonstrated by asking you
7204522 as a society we stand on the brink of losing a generation of talent which we can ill afford to lose
7204523 we know with certainty that unless we somehow increase the percentage of the graduating seniors who opt for college now about 55 to 57 percent the montana university system will experience considerable enrollment and thus budget volatility and inevitable decline during the next decade
7204524 such a prospect involves a gradual shift in the mix of enrollments between undergraduate and graduate students and between undergraduates who begin as freshmen and those who transfer
7204525 the strategy has the potential to lift the present enrollment of 14 000 students to 15 500 or 16 000 by the middle of the next decade with virtually all of the growth in the graduate and transfer students
7204526 the longer term outlook will become clear as we learn incrementally what we have achieved by year end
7204527 i look forward to working with you as we address the challenges before us
7204528 some people complain about the care theyve got it in their head that its not a good deal
7204529 people have to understand how many people they take care of it might be a little slower but the volume is just tremendous i think its amazing what they do
7204530 dont get me wrong everything is dollar driven to some extent
7204531 but there is never a push to discharge a patient here because of payment issues
7204532 to go to a va hospital when i started out i wouldnt have done it
7204533 id have gone downtown today there is no difference the only difference is that the va has become a respectable medical community
7204534 those two things truly changed the whole focus of the va system
7204535 kizer was the one who said were not going to sit in our hospitals and treat patients
7204536 they have very good doctors and people are super friendly and accommodating
7204537 one of the big reasons is they dont have to worry about money but i think they realize that when they come in that were not making big money and were not driving bmws and they see that were trying to do the best we can for them
7204538 providing this is not something you would find out in the private sector insurance wouldnt cover that its a preventative intervention that i dont know that youll find anywhere else
7204539 people say to me you should get something for your service you deserve it
7204540 overture and pay per click search engines are an effective means to advertise online

7204548 ive been fortunate enough to go to the world series our team won three times
7204549 the women quit so there we were without any women in the co ed league
7204550 the thing ive learned is you dont have retirees here like in florida

7204556 no no the team is playing good so i dont need to rush ill take a couple of more days i want to do everything take batting practice
7204557 he felt that if given a few more days that he would be much better prepared also saying that the team is playing extremely well without him
7204558 there is a different dynamic to our lineup when delgado is hot
7204559 by that i mean theres a different dynamic when hes carlos delgado and a lot of that just has to do with confidence when i watch him now i see him up there with the confidence i used to see when i played against him in 05 and the way he was when i thought he carried us offensively in 06 its not just that the guys in front of him get better pitches to hit and the guys behind him get better pitches to hit when hes hot pitchers always know where he is in the lineup
7204560 i dont know what his frame of mind is i know hes a very sensitive kid
7204561 hang in there dont look at your batting average just think about what you can do to help the team from now on
7204562 he is a sensitive kid but you have to be honest with him
7204563 i have a great relationship with him but i had to get in his face i got on him i rode him pretty good sometimes he doesnt like what you have to say but he appreciates the honesty
7204564 thats why we decided to do what we did it has gotten better treatment is definitely working
7204565 it was good i warmed up quick like a normal bullpen
7204566 i cut a couple loose and it felt good nothing tightened up after i let it go which is a good sign
7204567 thats when things get worse everything felt good free and easy
7204568 i dont really care i just want to play if they want to get creative then get creative
7204569 im pretty much open to anything at this point i just want to get back in there and help this ballclub win any way we can do it
7204570 physically hes fine hes just not throwing the ball the way we feel hes capable of throwing it obviously theres more work to be done
7204571 you have to be throwing the ball well to earn a spot we need their stuff to be right
7204572 i am comfortable with anybody that wants to gut it out
7204573 but if i feel thats not enough for us to win than i have to make some decisions
7204574 from the starting point i think of the way to win the gold
7204575 i dont think about the time from that point i push it push it push it
7204576 i remembered all the guys who would love to be in my shoes right now
7204577 i am not going up there trying to hit one i am just trying to get a hit
7204578 the intelligent homosexuals guide to capitalism and socialism with a key to the scriptures
7204579 were not the kind of place that stops everything just because a celebrity comes in
7204580 we get celebrities in here all the time was in here the other day josh hartnett
7204581 it was the worst start of a tournament ever because we were all so close to them
7204582 but everyone knew the way we could have made them happy it was to go out and play the best way we could possibly play
7204583 and that we came as far as we did i hope people watched at home i hope they saw how this is a true team i hope girls back home saw it this is not just any other game its a world thing you know were here to inspire young kids we never stopped fighting
7204584 were in touch with her by e mail joines said
7204585 we read hers and she reads ours she says it brings a smile to her face when she does
7204586 i play better i just kind of go on my emotions
7204587 the usa team is the best weve seen in the last four years
7204588 but weve got to think about what we really did we accomplished a lot
7204589 you are immediately struck by the enormity of this and the meticulousness of the records
7204590 thats the astounding part that they kept these records i guess that is part of their gestalt
7204591 i thought it was something i should get re involved in
7204592 i started reading and talking and taking pictures and making a lot of mistakes it was a leap of faith because everything had changed today everything is digital
7204593 about two years ago i tried to gain access to it and could not
7204594 then i found out that the victims not many of whom are left and their families were having the same problem
7204595 for reasons that are not well understood they kept this under wraps for a long time thats not to say some people did not get in but very few
7204596 not only was i unsure about how i would be received i didnt know if this would be a good photographic opportunity
7204597 and then when you go to the place its overwhelming
7204598 and yet this is a job for them they come to work at 8 a m and leave at 5 p m
7204599 me and my buddy filmed this 2 weeks before coming home from a deployment to afghanistan

7204601 the best asian american film since terminal u s a
7204602 attempting to burrow and disappear into the admiration of certain works of art i tried to make such deep and pure identification that my integrity as a human self would become optional a vestige of my relationship to the art i wanted to submit and submerge even to die a little i developed a preference among others for art that required endurance that mimicked a galactic endlessness and wore out the nonbelievers by ignoring my hunger or my need to use the bathroom during a three hour movie by kubrick or tarkovsky id voted against my body with its undeniable pangs and griefs in favor of a self composed of eyeballs and brain floating in the void of pure art
7204603 the man is described as being aged in his early 20s clean shaven and of caucasian appearance
7204604 we will be competing at more games and world championships and maybe we will have another chance to speak in the future
7204605 they didnt appear to be playing it up results at the moment and they are reluctant to show much tv footage live in beijing
7204606 this is related to the fact that shots of the outside of the birds nest stadium or the marathon road running would show how advanced the chinese have become they want to obscure those aspects
7204607 its huge its an olympics i feel great pride in my country
7204608 it feels like being a part of a family when a father performs well and makes the entire family happy
7204609 the olympics are a matter of prestige for the north korean government because they can go out and win gold medals
7204610 behind the three major asian powerhouses it shows that they are the next in the power rankings it shows that they can produce elite athletes
7204611 in the game i felt that they could still improve their technique but i think we got better score than we initially expected
7204612 the two north korean athletes levels were not the same so while i will continue to support young mi but i will find someone whose level is as high as wang ok
7204613 we will try to do better next time we didnt get a good score at synchronized swimming in this olympic we feel sorry to our korea people
7204614 because we didnt get a very high rank we will feel a little bit ashamed when we go back to north korea
7204615 the north korean athletes have great technical ability in playing table tennis they just dont have the international experience
7204616 i feel lucky to come to the games and to be chosen to be in beijing
7204617 i watched and i enjoyed the opening ceremony but it could not match the grandiose of our games of course it cant compare
7204618 hed go in on weekends just to make sure everything was all right
7204619 our kids loved being around him and being the kind of boss he was his employees liked having him around too
7204620 in the beginning he relied heavily on his managerial skills
7204621 but he did his homework and worked really really hard
7204622 he was a great guy as well as a great boss
7204623 presidents of companies dont usually spend so much time in the shop but he did he was always up and never moody he liked getting to know the people who work here and made it a point to talk with everyone
7204624 he was a proud dad and always talking about the things his kids were into
7204625 i know that you dont want to hear it especially coming from someone so young
7204626 change is imminent change is necessary and change is good
7204627 whether the entire festival or part of the festival could have a life at millennium park we would certainly welcome it with open arms

7204636 like it or not here comes a seriously wry comedy about the outgoing leader of the free world and were not going to mention that
7204637 it is obvious that this poster is boring odd and has zero to do with the movie i performed in the left side of my face seems to be melting off of my skull my character apparently has fallen in love with a strand of kate hudsons sic hair this is so glossy it makes entertainment weekly look wooden
7204638 finally what youve all been waiting for a romantic comedy starring dane cook
7204639 take these results into parliament and john keys national can almost govern alone with 60 seats it would need acts three seats to get it across the line
7204640 i would have roger douglas in cabinet in a heartbeat
7204641 the poll results show how tight it really is under mmp in opposition labour would have 46 seats the greens seven maori four jim andertons progressives one and united future also with one
7204642 so while this is still keys and nationals election to lose clark is heading in the right direction and as far as recent polls go she will consider this 11 point gap close and for key its not sleepless nights yet but its not exactly sleep easy
7204643 at the very best the good that can come of the twilight series is the idea that people actually can wait until marriage to be sexually intimate
7204644 at the worst it can introduce to girls of every age unhealthy ideas about sex and marriage
7204645 why hasnt stephenie meyer been excommunicated yet oh her vampires keep their shirts on i get it no i dont
7204646 mormon writers will now refuse to depict or mention any act of violence or other sin of any kind we will show only good people doing good in a world of perfect goodness where nothing thwarts or distracts people in their pursuit of righteousness
7204647 i think she is blatantly shoving her mormon faith down the throats of kids
7204648 i knew it was going to be an interesting ride
7204649 people say whats the message what moral is there to the story there never is one in my books
7204650 people find them reader interpretation is valid but for me its always just about the adventure
7204651 this is a gentleman that knows how to bring people together
7204652 i know that he has a good heart and the intent to pay back all that has been lost
7204653 except for the lobby there are none of the original elements
7204654 the real problem is going to be when it rains
7204655 i dont think theyre expecting it to happen but were planning for it
7204656 she saw how ministers needed to be taught how to lead and she really felt that she could do that
7204657 she had learned a lot in the parishes she was in
7204658 i will look into a potential deal with disney world

7204660 ich habe eine klare pro life einstellung und vertrete diese seit jahren im kongress und im senat und als pr sident w re ich selbstverst ndlich ein pro life pr sident dazu stehe ich
7204661 i despise the imbecility of american statesmen i detest the shrinkage of candidates for office
7204662 petition your state legislatures to pardon every convict in their several penitentiaries blessing them as they go and saying to them in the name of the lord go thy way and sin no more
7204663 our underdog role has seasoned us and prepared us for fighting a little harder
7204664 now with people of utah viewing the legislature as arrogant and not doing the public business out in the open it just provides us the opportunity to look at some new faces
7204665 theres a heavily mormon population in both utah and idaho that i think are oriented closer to republican social values than democratic ones
7204666 as long as we reflect fundamental values and principles some call them traditional values and principles then the voters can be reassured that republicans will continue to govern in a way that represents and meets their expectations
7204667 you can see the partisan ties on the republican side have weakened some and the bush approval has weakened some but we started off so firmly in the republican column that its hard to move voters over to the democratic side
7204668 the electorate in this country is becoming less tied to a particular political party
7204669 there is more volatility across the country and that may translate to utah as well
7204670 given the fact that the republican party has effectively repudiated a great candidate for president based on his religion i would expect that large numbers of people in both utah and idaho would look again at western democrats as a new way to go
7204671 the electorate in this country is becoming less tied to a particular political party there is more volatility across the country and that may translate to utah as well
7204672 needs to be who he is which is a maverick westerner
7204673 yeah hes a western senator an arizona senator but one who has been working in d c for an awfully long time
7204674 i still think for many westerners any democrat from east of the mississippi is kind of assumed to be a big government democrat
7204675 were likely to like having a few guns and how many well thats none of your damn business
7204676 we you know look at issues like oil and gas activity and were not of the mind set that it should all cease and desist
7204677 democrats win votes out west without entirely compromising themselves as a party
7204678 our rules that were just clarified say that our delegation will vote for the national convention candidate who received the most votes in the primary
7204679 if that candidate is john mccain that is who they are bound to vote for
7204680 encourage all released and uncommitted delegates to cast their votes for sen john mccain at the convention
7204681 the decision today had nothing to do with personality and has everything to do with simply interpreting an ambiguity in our rules
7204682 the state delegates overwhelmingly wanted our utah delegation to vote for romney it was pretty clear
7204683 so my intent was to follow the will of utah voters and the will of the utah state delegates
7204684 we would try to maintain their interviews as confidential as we could we wanted an open exchange of information about what happened
7204685 just didnt seem like he wanted to be talked to
7204686 one msha employee stated everybody got fired there at least once
7204687 did not fire threaten to fire or to reassign anyone the district manager did reassign msha employees during the rescue operation to best utilize their individual skills the investigators concerns may result from a misunderstanding by personnel of these reassignments during what was an innately stressful situation
7204688 i want to maintain the protection of these individuals they said things we dont think mr stickler should have access to
7204689 once he gets out of government its different but i dont think its appropriate for him being the head of the agency to find out who said what about him
7204690 we have no reason or intention to take adverse action against employees who cooperated with mr teaster and any thinking to the contrary is not based on any fact its mr teasters opinion
7204691 and theres no prohibition in any statute or law that would prohibit us from disseminating that information especially if it comes to the betterment of the agency
7204692 never give out any information about the club itself to outsiders
7204693 dont get overly friendly with someone who is not a regular acquaintance of the club
7204694 visiting gendarmes are equal opportunity arrestors especially if the target group is on reasonably good behavior
7204695 these people were calling wanting to know what our gun laws are
7204696 everyone was apprehensive and one bar even closed while the bandidos are in town
7204697 theyve been a lot more civil than our regular customers
7204698 we didnt want the kids to have to sell half of it to keep half of it
7204699 the laws were meant to help ranchers and farmers keep their land not to allow the wealthy to become more wealthy at the expense of the state
7204700 its easy to scream abuse but the federal government gave us the rules and colorado hopped on board
7204701 we decided it was actually better to live there ourselves
7204702 we had a desire to build there and get some open space around us
7204703 theres a view shed from that land and it would be better to keep it open than let it develop
7204704 it took some of the sting out of the purchase price
7204705 its exactly what the statute was designed to do conserve land
7204706 things fell apart for noahs crib and kids never went out there
7204707 from a family standpoint its how to take advantage of the tax benefits the government has provided
7204708 many times families will ask me whats the best way to do that this is one way
7204709 the tax law allows landowners to phase their property into conservation easements in this manner
7204710 many would like to see it stay the same for 100 years from now
7204711 some of us like to pheasant hunt and they have great ground
7204712 this is really a cool site it gives a better idea of how mechanics do their job
7204713 its not changing these conventions into quiet nights watching cable in the hotel room
7204714 its an opportunity for us to speak with members of congress and influentials whether its at a reception or at the various state party events
7204715 thats why were there to keep the issues important to the real estate industry and homeownership at the forefront
7204716 its really affected the tone and tenor of the site
7204717 the problem is that the relationship in identity between an avatar and the real person behind it is quite tenuous
7204718 the market is rising not so much on mr bernankes speech but renewed hope that lehman brothers may have a buyer
7204719 put simply how can incentives work if employees are not aware of their existence
7204720 for so many individuals to die like this is tragic
7204721 i dont think something like this has happened for a long time in southern utah
7204722 they were on a mission of service and this tragedy will leave a huge hole in the hearts of family and friends and communities they served
7204723 everybodys having a hard time its hard to put into words how devastating this is
7204724 when he came to cedar city he had a vision he wanted to accomplish and that was to take his specialty care to rural areas
7204725 he was one of the most accommodating service oriented people ive ever known
7204726 he was an athlete musical and a bright able pilot someone you wanted to spend time with
7204727 she was a very good loving person who would give anyone the shirt off of her back if they needed it
7204728 valerie was a caring happy person who left an impression on everyone she met everything she did was first class she was a neat lady its just not fair
7204729 he was a fun outgoing guy and just a wonderful person
7204730 she was a beautiful girl who was fun outgoing and artistic
7204731 a cosa porta la soppressione dei diritti in modo silenzioso
7204732 but factoring in the realtors commission i am pretty much out of the ballpark
7204733 given certain circumstances it could make sense but you just dont see many of these loans
7204734 a cosa porta la soppressione dei diritti in modo silenzioso
7204735 a cosa porta la soppressione dei diritti in modo silenzioso
7204736 a cosa porta la soppressione dei diritti in modo silenzioso
7204737 the centerpiece of our regulatory approach is giving investors the information they need to make wise decisions
7204738 we have an opportunity to exponentially improve the way we perform that mission
7204739 we have nothing against the technology we just dont want that delivery system
7204740 we see good better best in quality driving an increased trend towards consumer acceptability
7204741 and generally theres more advertising around private label than weve seen before
7204742 as consumers are being pressured by both food inflation and higher gasoline and energy prices
7204743 we believe low prices are key to winning in this trade down economy
7204744 consumer loyalty has tended to be towards the national brands and lots of categories have had no success like soft drinks and breakfast cereal
7204745 they are coming close to saying youve maxed out your credit buddy
7204746 theres so much schlock out there why not have something that can enlighten and stimulate individuals to remember a place
7204747 i had a shipment of two 40 foot containers come in and they need to be moved
7204748 we have key chains we have t shirts we have tote bags

7204755 if denver stays home then i think the times in between the parties will be lean
7204756 we have a healthy reservation book we have opportunities for walk ins
7204757 my true regulars said they arent going to come close to downtown
7204758 a frustration for caterers and hotels is they have the dates booked but not firm menus
7204759 we are getting a lot of last minute calls from frantic meeting planners
7204760 can have an impact on home prices in the area around the school
7204761 if theyre done well they can be attractive to the surrounding area
7204762 i think were in a time where taking two years off of work and getting an mba will allow me to get much better paying jobs
7204763 hopefully the economy will be rebounding by then and making its return to where it was a couple years ago
7204764 while there is anecdotal evidence theres no evidence of an overall trend
7204765 typically the trend is when the economy goes sour people look for ways to better themselves or their professional opportunities and one way to do that is to further their education
7204766 when the economy goes down the opportunity cost of attaining education is lower because your expected earnings are lower
7204767 opposing that is the ability to finance your education so if you dont have any money to finance it even though its the right time to do it you may not
7204768 it might set me back for a year initially but in the long run ill have a higher marketability rate with my further education
7204769 i believe colorado will lead this nation out of this recession depression
7204770 schools and workplaces will be able to compete for separate
7204771 wants the state to become australias biggest loser of weight
7204772 losing weight it is about encouraging queensland communities to become healthier across the board
7204773 more than 4000 queenslanders die prematurely every year from obesity associated diseases
7204774 coffee is fine for now its been a long day travelling
7204775 well its the launch of the western australian campaign thats precisely what its about dr nelson said
7204776 its about colin barnett and the liberal team in western australia making sure that they take it well and truly up to mr carpenter over the next two weeks
7204777 ive got nothing to say beyond what ive already said dr nelson said
7204778 the important thing here is that its important that the government prepare and release an economic statement our economy is slowing very sharply
7204779 weve got plummeting business and consumer confidence the reserve bank is forecasting inflation at five per cent in december and the economy has slowed to two per cent growth by the end of the year
7204780 the single most important thing we will be focused on this week is the fact that australians are worse off under mr rudd than they were under the coalition last year
7204781 well it amp squo s the launch of the western australian campaign that amp squo s precisely what it amp squo s about amp squo amp squo dr nelson said
7204782 a torrent of acrimony about the dubious inception and incompetent conduct of a war that ecame perhaps the worst foreign policy debacle in the nations history
7204783 reagans central insight that the liberal welfare state had grown complacent and overly bureaucratic with democratic policy makers more obsessed with slicing the economic pie than with growing that pie contained a good deal of truth
7204784 britney is so excited to attend the vma show but as of now there will be no performance
7204785 right now britney is focusing on her kids and recording
7204786 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7204787 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7204788 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent
7204789 up until the very end i was still unsure if he should go
7204790 he taught us everything we were doing wrong and he taught us stuff american coaches couldnt
7204791 science is interesting and if you dont agree you can fuck off
7204792 i would say that emilys vision continues in the people who are working to save special pieces of land to keep our wildlife and beautiful environment safe from being paved over with concrete
7204793 at the bottom we stood up and found ourselves in a magic forest
7204794 he is licking his lips and looking me up and down
7204795 the next day he called my house and asked if i was the girl who answered the door
7204796 hundreds of cities have implemented this retrofit for sale ordinance
7204797 we cant quite say it will reduce water usage but the new homes will be as water efficient as possible and provide money to the community for additional water conservation measures
7204798 my chief fear is that as soon as it passes it will be a green light for development
7204799 i had risen to the point where i had to run for office
7204800 running was more important than winning if i ran and lost i knew i could turn around and say ok i gave it a shot now somebody else take over we need new blood
7204801 now is the time to get our heads out of the sand clear out our ears and listen to economic business sense it would seem
7204802 printing dollars and issuing treasury notes with inadequate reserves will only shorten the next boom and bust cycle we are all feeling this pain right now we need to see it through get past the threshold and really test our own resolves to put things right ourselves
7204803 we all need to make a decision to save the next time that we get some spare cash clear off the credit cards before we spend the 600 stimulus check and make a choice for the children that they should not have to start their working lives at the beck and call of federal government debt as fomc members decide on where the economic cycle goes the economy may need consumers spending but right now that really is not in the consumers best interests and as the lack of available credit shows that is not in the institutional interests either
7204804 within two weeks i got a letter from dottie and i recognized her name right away
7204805 lets start talking she wrote she was very self effacing this was never about her she had the respect of all the other ladies in the group and they went along with what she wanted to do
7204806 left realizing that it was more than an exhibit there was also a story to be told on the silver screen
7204807 was very observant about sports and reflective about how the culture changed
7204808 when television came into being people had more things to do and she thought it played a part in the league ending
7204809 dottie wiltse collins strikeout queen of the all american girls professional baseball league
7204810 we were very serious in what we did we think of ourselves as a third major league
7204811 my friend if you ever lay in the bed of beauty very little of it clung to you
7204812 i want you all to promise me that you will learn spanish you cant live in california if you dont i learned it from the mexican lady who took care of me after my mother died when i was very young
7204813 my dad purchased some wooden blinds from howard he went back to pick them up from the store a couple of days later and the store was closed with a sign that said gone fishing
7204814 it was not uncommon for howard to keep haphazard hours at the store the interesting part was that my mom and dad left that next day for las vegas and of course found howard fishing in the casinos they laughed about that for many years

7204821 bagaimana kami akan berbicara dengan anak kecil yang masih dalam ayunan
7204822 sesungguhnya aku ini hamba allah dia memberiku al kitab injil dan dia menjadikan aku seorang nabi
7204823 hai maryam seungguhnya allah menggembirakan kamu dengan kelahiran seorang putera yang diciptakan dengan kalimat 195 yang datang daripada nya
7204824 ya tuhanku betapa mungkin aku mempunyai anak padahal aku belum pernah disentuh oleh seorang laki lakipun
7204825 demi nama yesus kristus aku menyuruh engkau keluar dari perempuan ini
7204826 o aisha tahukah kamu bahwa allah telah memerintahkan aku melakukan sesuatu sehubungan dengan permohonanku
7204827 ketika aku sedang berjalan tiba tiba aku mendengar suara dari langit ketika kepala kuangkat kulihat malaikat yang datang kepadaku di gua hira sedang duduk di kursi antara langit dan bumi
7204828 just think if you had your new boobs then you probably would have got off with a warning
7204829 we are responding aggressively to the challenges of todays u s auto market
7204830 we will continue to take the steps necessary to align our business structure with the lower vehicle sales volumes and shifts in sales mix
7204831 todays actions combined with those of the past several years position us not only to survive this tough period in the u s but to come out of it as a lean strong and successful company
7204832 our auto companies are rising to the challenge building the next generation of american cars but are doing so in times when credit conditions cripple the funding for the facilities and technologies to take the steps to the future
7204833 we should fund it and take action that will assist detroit and its suppliers in making it through this difficult time of transition
7204834 this is a horrible idea another transfer of funds to failed ventures
7204835 if this were a good idea the market would price the debt accordingly and give them the money
7204836 weve seen these kinds of bailouts for the financial companies why not the automakers
7204837 the big problem is that a lot of people in washington dont see a value in the u s auto industry because they have a foreign plant in their district that is doing just fine
7204838 weve done stupid things before so lets continue doing them
7204839 se busc hacer una versi n totalmente diferente que aunque conserve la esencia y la historia sea similar est pensada en m xico en nuestra cultura y en nuestra manera de ser hasta en la comida todo es diferente
7204840 se podr a pensar que el reto es se el que nuestros personajes no se parezcan a los originales sin embargo no es algo que nos preocupe porque est n bien definidos cambian muchas cosas
7204841 no hay ning n punto de comparaci n hay muchos chistes muy mexicanos
7204842 mucho para empezar me sal de mi estado jalisco ya radico en el distrito federal es el comienzo de una nueva carrera de una nueva vida lo que conoc a de antes ha cambiado como la hora de despertarme las cosas que hac a pero todo para bien todo ha ido llegando como por arte de magia

7204845 echaremos toda la carne al asador para que sepan c mo toca la cuca como siempre lo hemos hecho por el momento estamos enfocados a ese concierto aunque ya preparamos nuestro nuevo material
7204846 habr una evoluci n pues no podemos sonar como con se orita cara de pizza pero con el caracter stico sonido de la cuca tambi n podr a haber canciones de denuncia social
7204847 para qu seguir cantando pues el rock tiene esa encomienda
7204848 no entiendo c mo los exprimi tanto para dej rnoslos tan poquito tiempo
7204849 s lo es pues qu mala onda ya me hicieron llorar

7204851 entre mayor exposici n tengas hay gente que te quiere y m s gente que te odia por ejemplo madonna es una persona que lleva una fuerte trayectoria y que igual tiene una gran cantidad de seguidores como de personas que la odian entonces belanova pasa por eso adem s los mayores cr ticos somos nosotros siempre estamos en b squeda de ser mejores y eso es lo que ocasiona que sigamos creando
7204852 hay cr ticas dentro del p blico para mejorar pero lo que est por fuera que es algo real lo tomo como un consejo pero hay veces que simplemente lo hacen para descalificar entonces tienes que ser objetiva y descartar esos comentarios
7204853 es nuestra ciudad y aunque yo no sea tapat a me siento eso lo hace especial es un regalo para nosotros ser como un concierto gigante as que lo vamos a disfrutar mucho
7204854 creamos algo distinto sobre todo porque los tres ven amos haciendo m sica underground
7204855 esto no es noticia para m es algo de lo que yo ya estaba enterada y es una gran noticia y no tengo porque opinar de esto
7204856 no quiero p blicamente hacer un comentario al respecto porque se presta a que lo cambien nadie sabe los detalles de la relaci n que tuve con l ni siquiera a m me debe incumbir el detalle de su decisi n de tener hijos cada quien desea lo que realmente quiere en la vida y a nadie le incumbe
7204857 los actores y directores de este momento encuentran un lugar de mayor libertad y creatividad
7204858 el s ptimo arte est en un momento complejo porque todo lo que haces se puede ver en casa a trav s del dvd o internet adem s del fen meno de la pirater a creo que es un momento de quiebre de cambio
7204859 estoy seguro de que a m s de uno de los que estamos aqu en el blanquita los han asaltado o tienen amigos familiares o conocidos que han sufrido el embate de la delincuencia
7204860 tenemos confianza de que en esta ocasi n la marcha tendr repercusiones y no como la vez pasada que a pesar de que asistieron miles las autoridades no tomaron en cuenta la exigencia de la sociedad civil
7204861 yo no podr a resistir que me dijeran que un hijo m o fue secuestrado y luego que me dijeran que fue asesinado
7204862 tenemos confianza de que en esta ocasi n la marcha tendr repercusiones y no como la vez pasada que a pesar de que asistieron miles las autoridades no tomaron en cuenta la exigencia de la sociedad civil
7204863 nos vamos a unir a la marcha porque todos en una u otra forma hemos sido v ctimas de la delincuencia de las acciones violentas de esos individuos que nos acosan y perturban
7204864 la verdad no fue lo que esper bamos en cuanto a rating porque siempre se quiere m s pero nosotras como conductoras no nos fijamos en eso creo que no nos preocupar amos por nuestra chamba porque nuestro trabajo era divertirnos entretener a la gente entonces cumplimos con ello
7204865 es cuesti n de n meros y yo ah no me meto en realidad no s qu es bueno y qu es malo porque son muchas las cosas que se ven pero estoy muy contenta

7204898 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians

7204983 there is no reason to think these face transplants would not be as common as kidney or liver transplants one day
7204984 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7204985 i was very pleased with the first 15 minutes or so we created a lot of chances and could have scored a couple
7204986 but after that we did not play well and we allowed them to control our attacks they did not create too much themselves but it was not a good performance from our team
7204987 then in the second half they scored a good goal and we had to throw people forward to get ourselves back in the game
7204988 i am sure that jamie carragher will be claiming that goal despite the deflection but afterwards he was only really concerned that we had got ourselves level
7204989 but it was gerrard who showed the winning mentality he has done that so many times from a similar position many other players would have put it high over the bar but you know gerrard will hit the target
7204990 last season we drew far too many games at anfield but this time we have sent out a message that in such situations we can win the game we have winners here
7204991 that was hard to take the players are heartbroken in the dressing room
7204992 we deserved more we certainly deserved a point we produced a disciplined performance and the two matches we have played so far have given me plenty of confidence
7204993 we beat spurs last weekend and now we have very nearly beaten a side who can win the title
7204994 their equaliser was a freak and we should have been able to see out the game even at 1 1
7204995 but i have told them that they can leave anfield with their heads high
7204996 i almost fell off my chair watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 per cent cast iron damage proof
7204997 the contrast was all the more striking because until that point shed always had a memory like a website
7204998 from the fateful day of our lunch tell tale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7204999 whereas previously you would never have had to say anything to her twice because shed already filed it away in her formidable memory bank mum started asking the same questions over and over again unaware she was doing so
7205000 losing dad was truly awful for mum not least because her dementia meant she kept forgetting he was dead
7205001 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7205002 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7205003 im an east end boy and im proud that its happening in london i was very proud to be involved in the first place bringing it back to england and to london its going to generate so much interest in sport and kids are already getting excited about it
7205004 we have seen what the chinese have done here and im sure we will better that without a doubt
7205005 the first few innings i was definitely in a good tempo and the key is to stay in that regardless of whats happening around me
7205006 its staying on my approach every pitch every inning for me to stay on my approach every pitch is the key in the past when i got away from my approach i never found my way back
7205007 eight innings thats what you like from your starter a quality start he pitched well after a great start in his last one and a well deserved win for him he pitched well he stayed out of the big inning and had good stuff today
7205008 i was just trying to put it in play im going to work on my hitting in the offseason i definitely want to be a little more of a threat up there
7205009 at that point you need an extra base hit a clutch hit and richie came through for us
7205010 hes had a history of doing that and he did it today hes dangerous and hes a guy you like up there with the game on the line
7205011 i struggled with my nerves thats probably the best way to put it
7205012 it was amazing it was nerve wracking it was inspiring its the culmination of every dream after things started playing out i realized this is still baseball
7205013 hayhurst had a pretty good breaking ball i think hes going to throw strikes
7205014 he hung in there first and third no outs he got a ground ball zitos soft liner kind of got him i could see why some of our minor league people were on this guy
7205015 we thought the downside was limited the possibilities were reasonable and the amount of fun was limitless
7205016 if there wasnt a curve in it you could see both city limits signs
7205017 the proverbial light bulb went off i thought that might be fun to play with that name a little bit
7205018 i thought lets step out on a limb here and name the bank tightwad
7205019 to be really frank the customer base in reading kan was not too excited
7205020 but the tightwad bank was too good to pass up

7205043 players have been away on international duty and the performance wasnt the best
7205044 ive been a player and ive been away with england many times and it is hard to get going again
7205045 i had about an hour with my players yesterday and i think it showed in the second half we played into hulls hands
7205046 but we did it to everton last week so it evens itself out in the end
7205047 to be fair when you go ahead theyve got to start coming out and playing and that probably opens things out for us to go further ahead
7205048 but to concede straight after our goal was really really disappointing defensively we werent at the races
7205049 paul robinson could do nothing about it the header could have gone anywhere but it goes in off the post
7205050 but overall they deserved their point and could even have won it at the end
7205051 it was an exciting game to be fair and were always trying to win it and make it exciting for people
7205052 but sometimes and ive said this to the lads when youre tired and you know youre tired its important you have a bank of four and another bank of four and be hard to beat
7205053 but the positive thing is that although the lads are disappointed if someone had said to me from everton away and hull at home wed take four points we would have we just got it the wrong way around
7205054 well not get carried away because its only two games
7205055 but it was one of those games where paul ince was on a high after the result last weekend it was his first home game hes just signed santa cruz on a new contract so there was a little bit of momentum with blackburn and it was important we got something
7205056 we could have gone on to win the game and whether that would have been fair or unfair doesnt matter we could have won it
7205057 im ecstatic with a point to tell you the truth its a great point on our travels and if we continue with that kind of passion drive commitment togetherness well be okay this year
7205058 but it does come down to that little bit of quality in the final third which you pay a lot of money for
7205059 the truth is cruise workers like cabin stewards and waiters make most of their money from tips and cruise lines make it very clear to passengers how important this tipping is and how to do it properly money talks so good tipping will always help but also getting to know crew members being friendly helps too
7205060 im sure those people will say ok i have to do the liberty bell independence hall cheese steaks the rocky statue and the comcast screen
7205061 its just amazing how many people come flocking to this thing with smiles on their faces
7205062 to capture the 20 second audience in transit and get a smile on their face is unbelievably rewarding
7205063 theres a certain thing that people would expect to see up on a screen like that
7205064 and weve gone to great lengths to create the unexpected
7205065 it is something i have always had if we are not winning i get frustrated
7205066 i dont like losing if you are telling me that is wrong i wont believe you
7205067 everyone is saying i should score more goals but we won the league and champions league last season if that happens again i would be delighted
7205068 i certainly dont have any banter with cristiano about who scores the most goals
7205069 maybe he has a chat with the manager about it but i dont
7205070 more than likely he will be named world player of the year and everyone at the club will be delighted for him hopefully he can score the same number of goals again
7205071 there would be an extra burden if we did not sign another striker
7205072 carlos likes to drop behind a main striker which is probably his best position so maybe i would have to stay up a bit more i would have no problem with that
7205073 but hopefully we can bring another forward in to strengthen the team it would allow us to spread the matches out and make changes for certain games
7205074 but if that forward does not come in i am sure we can deal with it
7205075 youre sure not going to have any traffic jams in these parts
7205076 out here i can fish and hunt and be laid back
7205077 ive said before we suffered on the counter attack when other teams play a 9 1 formation if you score a goal it changes completely
7205078 i noted a lot of things against czech republic the good things and the bad things it is important for me because the four games we played before the level of teams were not like this
7205079 against czech republic i understood where we have to improve
7205080 at this moment there is a difference physically from the czechs and england players they were faster with more pressing and we suffered from this
7205081 they need to find a good condition it is impossible at the moment to be 100 before the game i decided wayne rooney and lampard would only play one hour i saw on tv rooney and gerrard but i did not see them myself last weekend
7205082 i was told both were so so and not in perfect condition for me these players are an important part of the team and i want to see them on the pitch
7205083 i think against czech republic i saw a good spirit not like croatia i think they are like turkey and have a big spirit of the country
7205084 but i am happy because the reaction of the players during the czech game was positive
7205085 our goal from the very start is to get people using these resources so they appreciate them and are interested in conserving them
7205086 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness

7205116 we know that during the afternoon ahmed and a group of friends were on the top floor of the block of flats
7205117 they saw the group of six youths approach the estate on bikes at that point they decided to leave ahmed had become separated from his friends who went to the third floor
7205118 ahmed remained at the top and it seems that one or more of the group made their way up to ahmed and he has been so scared he has made his way out of the balcony to shin down the outside of the flat
7205119 when he got to the seventh floor his progress was stopped by a grille
7205120 he has cried out for help lost his grip and fallen to his death
7205121 ahmed was a very much loved son grandson brother and nephew his loss is an enormous tragedy for his loving and devoted family
7205122 he was a happy friendly and generous boy who stayed away from trouble and was a good student
7205123 on the day of his untimely death he was due to receive his gcse results he would have been delighted to discover that his hard work and dedication to his studies had rewarded him with passes in maths and science as well as other subjects
7205124 his 17th birthday would have been on september 1 and this was the day he was due to enrol on a mechanical engineering course at tower hamlets college

7205140 the good news is that a lot of the big takeout vendors now carry compostables for wholesale price so its getting more competitive

7205142 this is true of plastic bags as well they both contain volatile organic compounds that leach into the soil or wherever theyre located
7205143 we want people to think about what theyre buying things in and to buy things that close the loop instead of buying something and tossing it without being mindful

7205163 bass pro shops has something for everyone and will be a magnet that sparks new hotels new retail and new activity
7205164 thats why we say that to suggest that bass pro shops is just a store is to say that graceland is just a house

7205171 it was a really good chance for me to get in there and get my feet wet there are things that i would like to do better but its a great learning experience
7205172 i was a little jacked up at the beginning of the game not that you guys could tell
7205173 it was exciting for me as the game went on i felt like i calmed down
7205174 the touchdown felt good and really that drive felt good
7205175 joe did ok in there without much preparation this week
7205176 thats what i want to do thats why this decision is even out there still and not already made because i want to play period the question is what should i do how long should i play with it

7205181 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7205182 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around

7205193 the range of products that we have developed allows us to serve a big diversity of clients from running global brand awareness campaigns through to very specific local campaigns
7205194 we will collect the profiles of the young consumers or members as we call them who use the service to find out their areas of interest
7205195 by understanding the preferences of our customers advertisers will be able to create very relevant campaigns
7205196 the response from our customers has shown more than just an acceptance of mobile advertising theres actually a real appetite for it
7205197 blyk provides visibility on who and when people are playing mobile games information which the industry has been sorely in need of
7205198 if there is too much advertising it may get boring
7205199 the advantage is that you get to find out about new things and the disadvantage is that it could eventually get annoying

7205201 the economic consequences of this policy can result in larger companies vertically integrating their operations in order to avoid higher taxes pyramiding punishes companies that are small or unable to integrate it also results in a lack of transparency particularly for the consumer as the cost of the many b amp o taxes levied on the end product is indecipherable from the cost of the product itself

7205250 ich habe das boot weder kommen geh rt oder gesehen pl tzlich sp rte ich in meinem linken bein einen starken schmerz und versuchte mit dem rechten bein wasser zu treten beim auftauchen schaute ich mich gleich nach tobias um konnte ihn aber nicht sehen langsam realisierte ich dass mich ein boot gerammt haben musste
7205251 ich wei nicht wie lange ich im wasser war es kam mir wie eine ewigkeit vor bis mich ein fischerboot gefunden hat der kapit n band mir mit einem seil das bein ab und hob mich gemeinsam mit einem anderen mann an deck ich sagte ihnen auf englisch dass mein bruder noch im wasser sei doch sie verstanden mich nicht

7205262 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
7205263 we are all friends of peters and he is a remarkable man a man of character
7205264 no matter how well you think you know someone reading a biography always offers insights and peters is a great story
7205265 his grandfather was gummy and his father who was blessed with ginger hair was bluey so these were people from good working class stock
7205266 peter battled through school at a time when we didnt recognise learning difficulties much less do anything about them and he was probably left down the back because people thought he was a bit thick
7205267 but we know of course that he is anything but and his message is really that if you work at it you can build your dream
7205268 he returned to butchery and opened a store in mangere and the brand spread throughout the land in what is a truly great story
7205269 it is the story of a truly great kiwi character
7205270 when i had my breakdown you were always there for me and that quality of loyalty is important to you
7205271 hes his own man and the book reflects that because it is sincere and genuine
7205272 martin offiah looked at me and said my father is a doctor and my mother is a lawyer what is the point of your question
7205273 peter just looked at me and said you that up murray now who do you want next
7205274 he has unique qualities and everyone knows of his passion and commitment and i am proud tpo be called
7205275 everyone has words they use to describe butch but if i had to chose one it would be priceless
7205276 it used to make me laugh but it also touched me that he would make the effort and stay in touch and that is partly why all the boys at the club and in the kiwis value his friendship so highly
7205277 that a prime minister would make time available for an old leaguie says a lot and is very humbling
7205278 i am just a bloke who had a bit of luck and a lot of support from people along the way but i am proud of being able to help a few causes out along the way
7205279 we also wanted to look and see if he could be a piece to be kept in play for next season to fall into the rotation and be the guy that hes been over the history of his career
7205280 we dont make short term decisions we brought him in with a two fold purpose he hasnt gotten out of the blocks the way he wanted to or we wanted him to but that being said we were in a bad position when he got here
7205281 if you can get past the outer aesthetics the ricoh r8 is a reliable swift and more importantly intuitive model to use this isnt a camera for you if you want control over shutter speed and aperture however and noise levels are high
7205282 photo quality is where the ricoh r8 needs the most improvement
7205283 the ricoh r8 looks and feels great and is capable of taking some great photos the camera still suffers from a poorly positioned flash and noticable noise levels at all iso settings
7205284 the camera produced nice images outdoors that show good saturation our indoor images also had good quality
7205285 we go through this expletive every year at the end of the day well take another ring with us
7205286 youve got to be healthy to win but were not going to use injuries as an excuse
7205287 weve got to find a way to win wed love to be a team that just runs away with it but thats not the way its going to be its going to be a tight race
7205288 every game we play is important from here on out
7205289 nothing was really working rushing through my delivery not a good tempo when i did get the ground balls that i needed they werent at people
7205290 just wasnt my day the ball was up basically everything that you dont want to do i did today
7205291 today just seemed a little flatter up in the zone made some mistakes on top of that seemed like every ball today found a hole lot of pitches in a short period of time
7205292 theres nothing really else to say i didnt get strike one when i did couldnt put him away
7205293 its just i guess one of those days just have to forget about it wash it down the drain come back tomorrow get your work done in five days go out and improve on it
7205294 just one of those days the ball was up and they were whacking it
7205295 when you get to your bullpen that early you run the risk of pitching guys more than youre supposed to which doesnt help
7205296 but if daisuke comes out and pitches today like hes supposed to it doesnt matter what happened last week
7205297 with the way theyre pitching theyre going to be very tough
7205298 its definitely not a team that you want to face a lot with the pitching staff that they have and then the hitting theyre getting now a lot of the times especially given this time of the year its not always who has the best team its whos playing well at the time
7205299 we go through this expletive every year at the end of the day well take another ring with us
7205300 got some inflammation and when you get some tingling youre looking at the nerve
7205301 beckett went out and threw real well yesterday was going to do a side today
7205302 were probably being overcautious but when it comes to somebodys arm and their future i just think we need to do that
7205303 i told him were trying to look out for your best interests i think he understands that in fact i know he understands that
7205304 this has been a weird one hes had these symptoms and weve been pretty adamant that as long as he has these symptoms we didnt want him throwing so we had to kind of shut him down for a couple days
7205305 its just my hand and fingers that were really concerning me obviously coming from the elbow
7205306 ive said all along its very minimal pain its just an uncomfortable feeling not being able to feel a couple of your fingers
7205307 i think were going at this the right way i have to be supportive of it
7205308 it was getting a lot better and the other day it jumped back up on me
7205309 its the end of my motion right when im trying to explode the other day it was a lot today it wasnt as bad but it was still there its a matter of we need somebody up here who can throw right now im not 100 percent so i cant help
7205310 i dont want to say that at all by no means i was able to throw and i was able to throw enough strikes definitely i wasnt throwing good strikes i wasnt throwing the ball right where i wanted to
7205311 i think its kind of cool that it was in toronto where i started where i had no 1
7205312 but we can win when he doesnt hit weve proven that

7205318 polybius the megalopolitan speaking of the great happiness which exists in lusitania and that is a district of iberia which the romans now call spania o most excellent timocrates in the thirty fourth book of his histories says that in that country on account of the excellent temperature of the air both animals and men are exceedingly prolific and the fruits too in that country never degenerate
7205319 for there are roses there and white violets and asparagus and other flowers and fruits like them which last nine months in the year and as for sea fish both in abundance and in excellence and in beauty it is very superiort to that produced in our seas and a siclus this is equal to a medimnus of barley costs only a drachma and one of wheat costs nine alexandrian obols and a measure of wine costs a drachma and a moderate sized kid costs an obol and so does a hare and of lambs the price is three or four obols and a fat pig weighing a hundred minae costs five drachmae and a sheep costs two and a talent weight of figs costs three obols and a calf costs five drachmae and a draught ox ten and the meat of wild animals is scarcely ever valued at any price at all but people throw that in to purchasers into the bargain or as a present

7205325 over the past few years ive had to face more than most people probably face in their lifetime from two major operations cancer and the ravages of chemotherapy to very deep personal issues surrounding life death and relationships and yet i still feel as though i am the luckiest man alive there are not many people who get a second chance at being alive and the chance to face their death again the first time i wasnt ready but the next i think i will be able to leave peacefully so i guess you could say im a survivor who has been given a second chance to complete the things i have come here to do one of those things is the making of this album it has taken seven years to complete and i think the wait has been worth while i hope you do to dream beautiful has a life of its own and i believe it will give joy to people and i could ask for no more

7205328 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
7205329 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past

7205331 society is saved just as often as the circle of its rulers contracts as a more exclusive interest is maintained against a wider one
7205332 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
7205333 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
7205334 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
7205335 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
7205336 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
7205337 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
7205338 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
7205339 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
7205340 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
7205341 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature

7205350 biden was a very strong leader in the u s senate and was not afraid to stand up to president bush on iraq policies
7205351 when he did vote in favor of the war resolution it was filled with caveats and warnings so i dont think anyone could accuse him of being pro war
7205352 i had been hoping all along that obama would chose hillary but biden is certainly someone who would be an able president if he had to serve in that capacity
7205353 going to take a little more work to bring the die hard hillary supporters along
7205354 if he obama is serious about changing america he needs hillary to help make that happen
7205355 i think to most people multimillionaires would be exempt from property taxes for eight years
7205356 i feel its a way to talk to americans and give them an entry point into the story
7205357 i believe rachel corrie was demonstrating for peace in rafah and peace in the middle east is on the wish list for most people
7205358 biden allies note that despite his long service in washington he is at his core an outsider inside the beltway while that may well be true the optics for obama arent great he cant change the fact that in picking biden he would be going with someone who has spent nearly his entire adult life not only in politics but as a member of the worlds greatest deliberative body

7205363 ive had it on my mind since the end of the last game last season being on the same field with southern cal in scott stadium what a blast thats going to be
7205364 its a great chance for a lot of our teams to show the world what we can do
7205365 those are the kinds of games players sort of live for
7205366 rather than moan about it the best thing for the teams in the league to do is use it for motivation and make people forget
7205367 top to bottom the accs going to be better a lot better i think
7205368 but it goes in cycles too if you look around the league i think you see that quickness level getting back up there
7205369 that would make the basketball schedule look easy in comparison
7205370 if we could translate the same logic of basketball to football and the end result was a really meaningful competition absolutely wed be interested

7205432 het feit dat ze onder deze omstandigheden toch in staat zijn geweest om lange tijd gelijke tred te houden met de landskampioen stemt me tevreden
7205433 het is zeker een serieuze test geweest want voor de wedstrijd tegen heracles zijn leroy fer jon dahl tomasson en jonathan de guzman de enige spelers die het nog kunnen halen
7205434 tegen heracles zullen we het dus grotendeels met dezelfde groep moeten doen of ik moet er deze week een speler bij krijgen maar het is bekend dat de club geen geld heeft

7205501 while americans are becoming more and more educated in terms of their time spent in school and their education level accomplished
7205502 they are decreasing in terms of literate behaviors this is particularly obvious in our lack of support of bookstores and the constantly diminishing circulation of newspapers

7205511 but a quality of life issue about keeping in place what we call home
7205512 we took a hard look at the whole thing as we set new standards for the 21st century
7205513 we have to balance opportunities for growth with needs of the environment and protecting sensitive areas of the community
7205514 no matter how hard we work on this issue we know we will have to tweak it
7205515 basically as we preserve farmland we have to direct growth to other areas where growth is wanted according to the master plan
7205516 field day was initiated to help build greater relationships within the incoming class
7205517 for many of the kids this is their first time on campus and we want it to be a positive experience
7205518 we hope that being here today will help these students get acclimated to the building and each other
7205519 we have a large building and it can be somewhat overwhelming
7205520 we wanted to do something to make things easier for freshmen by allowing them to meet their teachers and some of the kids they will go to school with this year
7205521 getting a pie in the face is just my way of doing something to help put the freshmen at ease
7205522 but im looking forward to making new friends people tell me that high school will be the best years of my life
7205523 my cousin told me he is going to throw me in a trash can and roll me down the stairs
7205524 this project opens the outdoors to a lot of people
7205525 the dam is really one of the areas hidden jewels
7205526 we have looked at ways to keep recreation open to the public without compromising safety and security
7205527 being a musician helped me gain an appreciation for classical music
7205528 i wanted to help other people gain a similar appreciation
7205529 the bso was asked to perform to bring another dimension of music to the people of havre de grace
7205530 its important to bring a named organization that is well respected to our community there are people who live here who havent left the town more than a handful of times
7205531 our target is families with children and dogs who come out and listen to music or participate in the activities
7205532 les cpc seront ils instanci s ou sur des cartes persistantes
7205533 i learned early on in life that you dont have to be a product of your environment
7205534 my goal is to make edgewood middle school the best in the county
7205535 i did a lot of praying before i came here and this is where god wants me to be
7205536 you cant find out whats going on sitting in your office
7205537 what better way is there to get to know kids than to sit down and eat lunch with them it shows them that im human
7205538 i told the teachers to treat the children how they treat their own children
7205539 it will show where you can buy everything burgers cheese ice cream and vegetables
7205540 we have such diverse ag products in this county that with the exception of oranges and grapefruits people would be hard pressed not to find what they want right here
7205541 farmers know they have to get closer to consumers and people are really developing relationships with the neighborhood farmer
7205542 people are meeting the person who is putting food on the table and asking what cows eat how chickens are housed
7205543 some farms dont need the publicity but most realize the huge potential we have right here along the i 95 corridor
7205544 our farmers know the value of selling direct to the consumer by cutting out the middleman they can maximize their dollars
7205545 we get more requests for locally grown food all the time
7205546 with all the recent scares i think more people want to know where their food comes from they are more conscious of that now and want things directly off the farm not something that has traveled thousands of miles to get to them
7205547 i have not taken hay to auction for about six years and all our beef is retailed locally my business has really picked up this year and i think its the local thing
7205548 a lot of dollars leave the county because of out commuting to jobs and shopping where they work we are doing whatever we can to get them to consider purchases closer to home
7205549 i go back to a time when there was no electricity and no freezers
7205550 and then i show people how things were done i enjoy seeing the excitement in the eyes of the audience i know i have connected with them
7205551 people come up to me at events and say things like are you from the north or the south
7205552 or they cant tell the difference between the american revolution and the civil war
7205553 people continuously stop me and ask to have their picture taken with me
7205554 especially the type you might see on interpreters at williamsburg
7205555 they were considered poisonous by 1801 tomatoes were sold commonly
7205556 one minute she will be talking about 18th century clothing
7205557 then that will segue into a discussion about aprons which turns into a discussion about cooking shes a continually rolling ball of fun
7205558 whats a jug of wine or how many cups in a pound of flour or the recipe calls for 13 eggs but eggs were smaller back then so how many of todays eggs should you use eighteenth century cooking is scientific experiments basically
7205559 the application which has been moved almost two weeks after the date of the order suggests to me that it is an after thought and has been moved with some ulterior objective and is not bonafide
7205560 the time it takes to ship a horse overseas begins from the time that animal leaves the barn to the time it plants its hoof in the soil of its new home adding a five to 15 hour van ride on top of the time in flight is not cost effective and causes additional stress on the animals being shipped
7205561 a permanent mid atlantic animal import and export center could reduce the cost of shipment for horse owners and buyers and reduce the stress on transported horses thereby increasing the overall condition and productivity of animals shipped overseas
7205562 hon st ller samma fr ga om och om igen

7205564 figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7205565 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7205566 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7205567 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7205568 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7205569 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7205570 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country
7205571 as we mourn the loss of our soldiers we are more determined as members of the canadian forces to carry on with our mission in support of the afghan people
7205572 i believe the majority of the canadian public supports that view as well and regardless of their political beliefs we are comforted in the knowledge that they support the soldier and that is most important to us
7205573 as a soldier of the government i follow direction and we are dependent on the government of the day we will carry on our duties
7205574 they are our opportunity to connect with canadians and send a message about who they are and what they do
7205575 its also an excellent opportunity to speak out to members of international organizations and countries
7205576 in fact our stated goal for london site of the 2012 games is top 12 and were almost there already
7205577 many canadians thought it was an emergency and maybe some of the inexperienced media might have
7205578 but anybody who has been around the summer games knows that by the end of the first week were only likely to have one or two medals
7205579 its not a reflection of us picking it up in any way
7205580 we just started doing sports that we are really good at we dont have any control over the two week schedule
7205581 mostly because of the stress and the pressure ive been dealing with for the last 24 hours theres been a lot of doubt in my mind the kind of thing that ive never dealt with before thats a little victory for me today
7205582 the last 100 was just a huge struggle i didnt have that usual pop that i do at the 200 metre mark but i went for it i was as strong as i could be today
7205583 i ended up lying around and tossing and turning a lot i had four or five cold showers that didnt do anything either
7205584 im used to finishing on top its a little bit much to ask that i do it every single time but thats what i wanted its not a failure you shoot for the stars sometimes you only make it to the moon
7205585 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7205586 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7205587 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7205588 el xito de las olimp adas de beijing se debe a los esfuerzos concertados de los pueblos chino y del resto del mundo
7205589 la gloria va a la familia ol mpica a los atletas que han competido duramente a los volunatarios de diferentes partes del mundo y a los amigos que en todo el mundo se han involucrado en los juegos de diferentes maneras
7205590 what we endeavor to do each time is to introduce the franchise to a new audience make it a bit more contemporary more relatable
7205591 the ambition with universe is to skew it younger than the previous two chapters and fill it with a fresh faced cast and a storytelling that is more for the late 2000s than it is for the 1990s
7205592 as a network obviously we look at battlestar galactica thats set the standard in terms of tense character drama stargate does not have the intensity of a battlestar galactica but it may well be somewhere in between brad wright and robert cooper are very eager to keep the action and adventure and the sense of humor in stargate universe but i think theres an opportunity to maybe inject a bit more dramatic intensity into the series but thats obviously a conversation for them as they start to script and move into development
7205593 i think these things lend themselves to a bigger kind of high production value two hour event which is great
7205594 theres obviously a passionate audience for atlantis and the characters of atlantis
7205595 and yes theyre absolutely going to continue in the movie franchise but people need to mourn for a while and come to terms with it i dont anticipate that that will subside quickly but once universe is on air and they have kind of their next fix of the stargate franchise i think hopefully people will realize that its in safe hands at sci fi that we really value this franchise and its in our interest and the fans interest to let us continue the story and figure out how to retell it for a new audience every few years
7205596 to be honest we knew the odds were stacked against us
7205597 still given the numbers we did hold up hope for a renewal
7205598 im certainly satisfied with what weve accomplished over the shows five year run
7205599 i cant predict whether an ongoing series of atlantis based movies will prove successful
7205600 however if the performance of the two sg 1 movies is anything to go by the audience is out there
7205601 it will be more like continuum than ark of truth in that it will continue the story of atlantis in a one off offering
7205602 while the adventure will be stand alone the character moments will certainly draw on past experiences and future potential
7205603 while i like the idea of some crossover i think sg 1 movies should be sg 1 movies and atlantis movies atlantis movies
7205604 two movies of each a year would be a true best case scenario
7205605 i think that we could produce as many as three stargate either sg 1 or atlantis movies a year
7205606 unable to return to earth the crew must fend for themselves aboard the ship which has a preprogrammed mission taking them to the far reaches of the universe
7205607 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
7205608 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
7205609 in universe we plan to keep those elements that have made the franchise a success such as adventure and humor while breaking new ground in the relationships between mostly young and desperate explorers thrust together and far from home
7205610 above all we believe the stargate itself remains an enduring icon with infinite potential as a jumping off point for telling stories
7205611 er kunnen nu 62 sporters een medaille om hun nek doen dat is een mooie score
7205612 dat is wel heel bijzonder ik win een keertje en beleef daarna een aaneenschakeling van mooie dingen
7205613 we hebben als nederlands team ook hele goede spelen achter de rug het is heel speciaal dat ik straks die ploeg en het land mag vertegenwoordigen
7205614 het maakt het extra leuk dat heel veel mensen hier achter staan al had ik het ook mooi gevonden als alleen charles van commen e mij had gevraagd
7205615 sci fi has enjoyed tremendous success with stargate sg 1 and stargate atlantis and were proud to be the home of the new stargate universe
7205616 universe will continue the stargate legacy of vibrant storylines and compelling adventures but will re invent the format in a whole new way
7205617 a little more character based a little less rooted in a sci fi mythology
7205618 it really does come down to characters and stories that are engaging and that people want to see that they feel like they havent seen before
7205619 this is an opportunity to reinvent this franchise and make it relevant to a new generation
7205620 we really dont want to be more of the same its going to build clearly off the existing franchise but with a cast that gives it a younger vibe
7205621 its not the case that anything is being pushed aside any more than sg 1 is pushed aside
7205622 shows have a life and they live their life there will always be a point where those people are disappointed this is a way of preserving atlantis going forward in a very strong way

7205643 to jennifer and the lobby staff at the paramount theatre when i showed up for a chorus line with tickets for the previous nights show by mistake they were gracious helpful and compassionate since there were seats available we were able to enjoy the show their good customer service was in glaring contrast to the man in the box office who could think of no solution other than for me to buy two more tickets my mistake but the lobby staff saved the day

7205650 i wrote you several months ago about my son who almost died back in october 2007 from vitamin a poisoning the dermatologist taking care of him had prescribed accutane and that seems to have been the cause
7205651 he has been using milk of magnesia topically at bedtime for months now our pediatrician ran a test to make sure he wasnt getting too much magnesium and also retested the vitamin a level to see if it had come back to normal
7205652 the happy news is that both magnesium and vitamin a levels are normal my son looks great and feels well

7205661 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
7205662 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
7205663 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
7205664 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
7205665 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
7205666 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
7205667 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
7205668 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers

7205674 i knew it was going to be an interesting ride
7205675 people say whats the message what moral is there to the story there never is one in my books
7205676 people find them reader interpretation is valid but for me its always just about the adventure
7205677 please if you hear arguing regardless of how insignificant fighting screaming if the music is too loud call the police
7205678 its been quite candidly pretty tough some of the time for me in my new job
7205679 but seriously cbs and couric should be pleased who wouldnt take an audience gain of 28 400 viewers these days and feel good about it
7205680 to see us gaining and making strides in some of these major markets is wonderful news
7205681 ive always felt proud of the broadcast even in the early days when it was so criticized for certain elements im one of these people who thinks its ok to take chances and to try things i always thought even the things that werent well received were noble efforts in trying to evolve the broadcast so the fact that were doing well is very gratifying
7205682 i think one of the most exciting aspects of my coming to this job was the chance to spread my wings on the internet
7205683 i think anybody who hasnt been living under a rock for the last 10 years understands how news consumption is changing dramatically and how the internet is playing an increasingly important role im a naturally interactive person in terms of my personal style and were trying to reach out to folks
7205684 on the internet its a much different sensibility they want it a little more raw less filtered less varnished and i think that plays to my strengths its sort of more of a today show sensibility in terms of being relaxed or being able to make a mistake or laugh at yourself or ask an off the wall question i always thought that hopefully i could be a successful bridge between traditional media and the internet just in terms of the way i communicate in a more casual way
7205685 even given the gains in cities like baltimore the question is can they build on them and improve the national ratings
7205686 they have to do that first and it takes time the question then becomes how long couric and cbs are willing to stick with it
7205687 i think she has been caught up in the desperate efforts of tv news to try to retain audience through an ill considered meshing of solid journalism and mush that has no true constituency i think couric is knowledgeable about the world and if she were allowed to do a harder edged newscast she might fare better
7205688 i have no plans to leave i want to do the best job i possibly can for cbs news i care about our newscast and my colleagues and i have no plans to split
7205689 a lot of people like to write about well shell leave here or shell leave there but thats never been an issue here

7205696 unfortunately aariks injury reared its ugly head on his second jump
7205697 for quite a while now hes been jumping with multiple fractures in his leg and the injury was reignited in the worst way the jump counted though aarik limped into the pit visibly in pain but at this point after the third jump it was clear the pain was badly affecting him and he was short of the 17 10 meters needed to qualify for the finals
7205698 were all so proud of what hes done being counted as an olympian is a feat most of us will never attain
7205699 once hes had time to heal we can only imagine some fantastic things to come

7205726 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7205727 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7205728 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7205729 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7205730 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7205731 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7205732 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7205733 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7205734 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7205735 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7205736 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7205737 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7205738 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7205739 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7205740 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7205741 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7205742 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7205743 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7205744 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7205745 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7205746 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7205747 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7205748 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7205749 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7205750 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7205751 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7205752 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7205753 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7205754 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7205755 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7205756 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7205757 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7205758 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7205759 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7205760 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7205761 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7205762 who are open to doing something on the production side
7205763 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7205764 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7205765 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7205766 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7205767 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7205768 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7205769 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7205770 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7205771 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7205772 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7205773 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7205774 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7205775 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7205776 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7205777 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7205778 after discovering that thermal expansion of steel from a low temperature fire led to the collapse of world trade center building 7
7205779 we started realizing that other metal objects might also be at risk
7205780 we also determined that car engines airplane engines and boat engines could all suddenly fail due to thermal expansion
7205781 indeed we soon realized that almost all industrial processes could lead to catastrophic failure other than perhaps those used in freezers
7205782 once you understand this principle of thermal expansion you start to realize that even household showerheads and faucets are dangerous the hot water flowing through them could wreak havoc the president is committed to leading the way back to a safer time and a return to proven traditional materials which may not be flashy like metal but remain rock solid even when warm
7205783 janamashtmi is an eight day hindu festival that celebrates the birthday of one of hinduisms greatest gods krishna
7205784 are not holy like the holy quran and the hadith
7205785 political parties do not make promises they only arrive at understandings
7205786 sometimes 50 percent successful and sometimes more than that but are still considered successful
7205787 bhutto did not impeach yahya khan because in that case general niazi would also have been impeached and sheikh mujeeb had been asking india to hand niazi over to bangladesh
7205788 everyone goes up there and looks around because its got the most amazing view but no ones been able to fix it up and make it a lovely leisurely park to stroll around
7205789 rather than spending years in a court battle and millions of dollars of city money we thought there was a more practical solution
7205790 for a lot of people its a personal landmark in their lives we didnt want someone else to have control over what happened to it
7205791 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7205792 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7205793 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7205794 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7205795 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7205796 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7205797 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7205798 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7205799 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7205800 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7205801 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7205802 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7205803 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7205804 lewitts drawings have become landmark works in the museum and we are sorry to see them go
7205805 but we are happy to announce that new works will be installed in the atrium
7205806 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7205807 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7205808 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7205809 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7205810 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7205811 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7205812 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
7205813 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7205814 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7205815 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7205816 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7205817 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7205818 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7205819 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7205820 for the first time in almost a decade were reallocating away from europe and moving into u s stocks
7205821 one of the easiest calls you could make was to be short of u s stocks and own more of the rest of the world
7205822 there are good arguments to be invested in the u s but for europe and the rest of the developed world the challenges are only just now coming home to roost
7205823 its hard to know how much faith to put in the e
7205824 if the rally were to go significantly further some of the relative corporate earnings momentum helping the u s may start to go away
7205825 its certainly going to complement whats already happening here and going to add a new layer to what we have to offer
7205826 weve already done a lot of the infrastructure for a second tower in case we decide to do it
7205827 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7205828 obviously joe and i have been on different philosophical sides but i consider him a good friend and good man
7205829 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well
7205830 well ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different counties countries
7205831 i never agreed with that but i appreciate very much his dedication to trying to solve this genocide thats going in darfur and other things that joe biden has done
7205832 but we really have different approaches to many national security issues i look forward to whoever my running mate will be having a respectful debate with him on that as well
7205833 and he shook his head too proud to say anything
7205834 please by all means get your friends together bang your pennies together and do an investigation but dont wait for the entity you accuse of the mass homicide to do it for you manson never investigated his own murder case for the da amp prosecutor did he theres plenty of evidence thats been used amp being used to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that alqaeda is responsible for 9 11
7205835 it could be in the air for 8 10 hours and theres potential harm if it is carrying a large amount of toxic material
7205836 of course we watched it as closely as we did anything that was on our radar screen
7205837 what if this individual could not sell to the military
7205838 would he then turn and sell it to the highest bidder
7205839 just got my copy of judaism discovered and i must say my mind is thoroughly blown
7205840 aric drove another awesome race and it should have been a top 10 finish
7205841 we made a mistake on a pit stop and there wasnt enough time to make up the positions we lost usually when you finish 13th at bristol youre not that upset but tonight we are we know were a better team than what the finish showed
7205842 we had a strong run tonight and its just too bad we had that hiccup near the end of the race
7205843 this team gave me a good car tonight and our chevy impala ss was definitely capable of equaling our finish here in the spring i told the team that i am proud of them and were all in this together when you wear the army uniform you dont point fingers you support each other and fight on
7205844 we missed a couple of wrecks and made it to the end which is what you have to do here
7205845 we should have finished a lot better than we did
7205846 it was an honor to drive the dlp toyota though its a good team and i had fun driving i just wish we could have finished a little better
7205847 no because he does that and hell always come back and say hes sorry he did it at milwaukee hes done it a few other times you know its just his normal fashion and so thats fine ive grown to know that now you know to pass a guy to hit him getting into the corners and chatter his rear tires is what he did i tried to get him back but i thought better of it and tried to pull down and pass him back but i just didnt have a good enough car to stick and denny got to my outside and he got by me and then i had to battle him there towards the end we were clean as could be of course its just one other dude that we had a problem with
7205848 its very important im here to win no matter what car im driving or what number is on the side of what kind of car im driving that doesnt matter im proud of my guys and how they battled here all night it was a solid top 10 for our team and thats a good day here at bristol
7205849 a typical performance out there tonight for us we got one really strong run out of the chassis but then fought a tight condition the final 200 laps of the race we pulled spring rubbers took wedge out but nothing helped the situation we have to be able to adjust on these things to get the front end to turn better until we can do that about a top 15 car is all weve got
7205850 we started off really loose and got behind we got our miller lite dodge tightened up and ended up getting too tight at the end we got a hole in the nose late in the race which hurt us a bit so we tried to adjust to that and just got a touch to loose in the end
7205851 i thought we had a pretty good night after such a bad qualifying run we had to start so far back and that makes it hard to race here when you have to pass so many cars our juicy fruit guys did a great job all night in the pits which gave us good track position to come out of bristol with a top 20 finish after starting 42nd is a good feeling im happy for our chip ganassi team well take it and move on to california next weekend
7205852 our cheerios box tops for education dodge charger was just too tight all night we didnt fix it in practice and werent able to fix it in the race
7205853 it was a tough night we had a really good car i think we would have finished in the top 10 for sure if not for some weird mishaps we may have had a top five car with a shot to win the motor shut off on the first pit stop which messed us up in the pits the next thing you know elliotts seatbelts are undone and we had to pit under green which put us down a bunch of laps you cant race with your seatbelts undone and its tough for a driver to get all hooked back up with the belts with a helmet on it was just a bad deal
7205854 it looked to me like the 5 and 55 got together
7205855 the mobil 1 dodge didnt have quite as good of a handle on it as we wanted we started to log some laps and make sure we made it to the end i saw the 5 car go around and start sliding up the track but then there was already somebody beside me i got on the brakes and tired to get away from it as much as i could i dont know everything happens real quick here its been a lot of fun for me to be able to run at bristol the last two nights and i feel like ive learned a lot but we still have a lot more to learn well get this mobil 1 dodge running a little better the next time we come back
7205856 the 55 and the 5 got together in a group of about seven of us i was sixth in line and was trying to slow down but there was nothing that i could do its unfortunate because our car was really fast we started off really tight made an adjustment on the sherman williams barrett jackson car and it was really good we ran with the leaders for about 70 laps before the incident unfortunately another good car with a bad finish thats bristol sometimes you get out of here with a perfect race car and sometimes you get wrecked
7205857 im ok we had a good racecar and its a shame that we got caught up in that mess the crash happened so fast i just saw cars wrecking everywhere in front of me and there was nothing that i could do i saw the 5 and 55 and the next thing that i know i got hit from behind and tore up our budweiser dodge up pretty good its disappointing because were going to take a hit in the chase points but thats the risk you run here at bristol i love racing here at bristol its a great place with great fans its just a bad deal for us tonight
7205858 we actually paced ourselves and tucked in behind tink early on when we realized our car was a little faster i went on around him the car worked good running low i have to give credit to gary sanford j for that
7205859 racing here and growing up here has helped me a lot they say if you can win here you can win anywhere its a pretty tough track so racing here has helped me everywhere
7205860 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7205861 multi citizenship with responsibilities owed to and allegiance to other countries
7205862 the mobil 1 dodge we didnt have quite as good of a handle on it as we wanted we started to log some laps and make sure that we made it to the end i saw the 5 car go around and start sliding up the track but then there was already somebody beside me and got on the brakes and tried to get away from it as much as i could i dont know everything happens real quick here its been a lot of fun for me to be able to run at bristol the last two nights and i feel like ive learned a lot but we still have a lot more to learn so well get the mobil 1 dodge running a little bit better the next time we come back
7205863 i dont know it looked to me like the 5 and 55 got together everybody is running so close after the restart that it just looks like theres nowhere for anybody to go once that all breaks loose i just wish that the mobil 1 dodge you know had been able to make it to the end it just looked like everybody kind of got together everybody was pushing each other real hard not a lot of room out there and when everybody gets together and runs that tight you know you get one car sideways and theres not a whole lot of room for everybody to go yeah were running at a half mile were running on some of the slower speeds that were going to run all year long but when things start to happen it theres not a whole lot of time to make adjustments for it
7205864 i think it speaks a lot about this team every time we go to a brutal racetrack we run well we just need to pin down these big tracks now and well be in good shape
7205865 yeah you know it stinks cause i got 10 raybestos rookie points and sam finished 43rd and got nine it doesnt seem like it does justice on days like that but im sure itll be the other way around before the year is over too thats how it goes
7205866 im excited about going there after michigan i learned a lot and feel like we can be even better when we get there so its good
7205867 were really happy the car was probably a little better than that but we had a little bit of trouble pit stops werent as good as we needed and we got pushed up into the wall one time and kind of hurt the car a little bit but the car was really good its coming together really good were pretty happy hopefully we can just keep going
7205868 oh its really important especially with regan to build his confidence and were helping him were just having more and more fun each week
7205869 well we are we feel real happy about our progress and the way our cars are driving and everything so hopefully we can keep going
7205870 well like i said weve been working on these cars real hard and we know what regan needs and were giving it to him its just getting better regan is getting better were getting better and its all coming together and thats how you build a good team
7205871 according to very preliminary information a train carrying fuel exploded on the railway which we think was mined
7205872 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7205873 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7205874 we cant even flee theres curfew on the one hand and on the other hand militants use us as human shield when they are attacked what we can do
7205875 change is imminent change is necessary and change is good
7205876 whether the entire festival or part of the festival could have a life at millennium park we would certainly welcome it with open arms
7205877 i just dont know if moving the fest totally there is totally a possibility for us we dont fit in that space would i like to see more use of that space for the festival obviously yes
7205878 we would just have to find other creative ways to get a sponsors message out
7205879 ais 18th single kurage nagareboshi thats my problem to ii dont have the money for this because i buyed last week
7205880 a clear eyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7205881 into the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics he once so deplored
7205882 hell have to figure out which of his seven kitchen tables to sit at
7205883 i figure if they can come here for our friendliness i can go there for their costco
7205884 that half mile walk is intended to be like a walk back into time so visitors can experience the place the way someone would before cars were present so they can experience what it was for the lightkeepers every day when they went to work
7205885 even the pale green around the window panes replicates the patina found on the bronze fittings in the lighthouse lantern room
7205886 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7205887 why is it that joe biden is the first in his family ever to go to a university
7205888 why is it that my wife who is sitting out there in the audience is the first in her family ever to go to college
7205889 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university why is glenys his wife the first woman in her family in a thousand generations to be able to get to university
7205890 biden was a very strong leader in the u s senate and was not afraid to stand up to president bush on iraq policies
7205891 when he did vote in favor of the war resolution it was filled with caveats and warnings so i dont think anyone could accuse him of being pro war
7205892 i had been hoping all along that obama would chose hillary but biden is certainly someone who would be an able president if he had to serve in that capacity
7205893 going to take a little more work to bring the die hard hillary supporters along
7205894 if he obama is serious about changing america he needs hillary to help make that happen
7205895 terry spear the trials and tribulations of publication and those most devilish of heroes the vampire
7205896 you cant change america when you supported george bushs policies 95 of the time
7205897 i say with every fiber of my being i believe we cannot as a nation stand for four more years of this
7205898 joe wont just make a good vice president he will make a great one
7205899 hes an expert on foreign policy whose heart and values are firmly rooted in the middle class
7205900 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for american cops and firefighters
7205901 hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7205902 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous
7205903 nothing wrong with that who wouldnt want to be described as such by his or her partner
7205904 it was obviously a failed attempt at humor or perhaps im just a humorless feminist either way one can only hope this isnt a harbinger of gaffes to come
7205905 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7205906 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7205907 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7205908 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7205909 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7205910 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7205911 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7205912 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7205913 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7205914 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7205915 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her

7205921 if its a referendum on obama then the question is much less about how bad bush and mccain are and about how good really is obama

7205948 as somebody who is just a regular average citizen i dont know that im really worried about unity
7205949 i felt like hillary had been airbrushed out of the picture
7205950 i feel robbed about the opportunity to be excited about that
7205951 a woman really qualified worked her whole life for this did everything she can and she got cast away for the charismatic male with half the r sum
7205952 might pave the way for people to unify and to come together and to feel heard
7205953 i think a lot of the upset that ive read or heard about with regard to some of the clinton supporters was more targeted to the media than it was senator obama particularly
7205954 grossly disappointed that she isnt the partys nominee they see that as something as a setback for the womens movement
7205955 i said for a long time that if hillary ran id support her
7205956 there are people who still need to understand and recognize what he will bring to the table and then there are people who need to understand what will happen if he doesnt get elected
7205957 i firmly believe that if someone chooses to sit this out that is a vote for mccain
7205958 if the democratic party isnt tight and unified and not just in a sterile produced sense but in an individually committed sense were going to have some rough sailing in the fall

7205991 im racing to make this gap in the championship smaller
7205992 but the race is going to be a tough one
7205993 its a hard pill to swallow to go from last year and having 18 cars and having a couple of front row starts to now this year having 26 27 really good cars
7205994 when people make mistakes i think thats how youre going to get your passes done

7206033 by the time we finished the movie i had no voice left
7206034 it sort of came upon us because wed been working in documentaries as an extension of the political work wed all done and we suddenly thought nobodys ever had a film festival at the conventions before

7206058 while it is sitting in a landfill if it even makes it to a landfill it releases toxins
7206059 this is true of plastic bags as well they both contain volatile organic compounds that leach into the soil or wherever theyre located

7206080 johnny is such a faux mosexual look at the way hes dancing to webmd feature about teens exploring sexual identity referencing the madonna britney spears kiss
7206081 general dictionaries are probably going to stay away from a word like faux mosexual because it seems a little ephemeral

7206091 dr kinlaw i am a liar now what do i do
7206092 watching films made by young people was really inspiring to me because it was such an unjaded look at democracy
7206093 there was a group of kids arguing about the presidential election and getting pretty vehement about it
7206094 the parents started talking about how the kids didnt really understand what democracy was
7206095 the slumping economy and struggling housing sector continues to drag down spending on home improvements
7206096 households are reluctant to undertake major improvements in the context of falling prices

7206098 an external hard drive just like other ones but it has a big shiny glowing button on the front and it comes with backup software

7206108 i was just seeing films that were about indians and i thought i could do better
7206109 it was scary because i knew the cost of film thats when i learned time is money
7206110 the indians wouldnt follow my direction but they would listen to the white guy
7206111 its a very select group especially for native documentaries if were ever going to make an impact we have to make feature films

7206116 what many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7206117 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7206118 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7206119 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7206120 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7206121 senator biden will be a purposeful and dynamic vice president who will help senator obama both win the presidency and govern this great country

7206128 all we need is a voluntary free spirited open ended program of procreative racial deconstruction everybody just gotta keep f everybody till theyre all the same color
7206129 the trick is to know what the people want and then know what they will settle for
7206130 you think im licked you all think im licked well im not licked im going to stay right here and fight for this lost cause even if the room gets filled with lies like these and the taylors and all their armies come marching into this place
7206131 im going to tell you something really outrageous im going to tell you the truth
7206132 some speechwriters have the tendency to become what is known as paranoid
7206133 i kept saying i dont know how to do this
7206134 i had no idea how opera was made i was as mystified by the process as anybody else
7206135 she was completely intuitive about what needed to be done
7206136 and she was absolutely courageous about deleting characters changing incidents and reconfiguring the plot
7206137 you have to stand back and let the performers and the medium work for you we kept looking for places where the music could take over and for things that would reverberate later in the opera the words are there but theyre not the most important thing
7206138 it really is quite humbling to see these characters who have been in your head come to life and sing onstage
7206139 but theyre not the qualities i have in me now and theyre exaggerated
7206140 shes tragic and dramatic and then she gets to come back as a ghost how great is that it never occurred to me that i might play ruth
7206141 stewart told me that he liked the colors in my voice and he thought he could shift things enough to work for a mezzo
7206142 if im going to see amy i know i have to dress up nice
7206143 the first thing i told her was that i have never played a live character before all my roles cherubino rosina theyve been dead for centuries but i can relate to ruth and her inner conflicts there are things from my upbringing and my experience of moving away from a country where you are very protected by your parents that i can definitely connect to ruth
7206144 were going to take zhengy back to the 70s and have her do drinking and drugs and go to high school dances and get in trouble then ill be the mother and say oh what are you doing then shell really understand
7206145 be wary fear is your best friend that was her attitude ruth is cowed by it i was much more rebellious and reactionary fortunately i havent inherited this need to kill myself but i could see where it comes from i could feel the impulses that have been a part of this family for a very long time
7206146 my mother always saw things in her mind as though they were happening right in front of her
7206147 and then she put the coat on me as if i were the mother
7206148 with a knife in my heart how you ruin your life
7206149 i could see more clearly the emotional history that was passed on from generation to generation
7206150 luling received it one way and ruth another but it came from the same source
7206151 every night i could discover something new about ruth and just spontaneously put it out there opera is live you just never know until it happens
7206152 the great thing with the collection is that you go in storage and suddenly you see this sculpture
7206153 he was never the michelangelo of the 20th century but it was such a beautiful sculpture i love the way he works with the material
7206154 the fabulous thing in contemporary art is that the figure is still something that a lot of artists are dealing with and it has many layers that are not just about having something figurative that you can recognize
7206155 but artists can talk about politics talk about patriotism talk about body talk about sexuality talk about social issues how people interact with each other all these subjects all these ideas are very tightly connected to the figure
7206156 i saw this space which is a little difficult with this staircase in the middle and i thought maybe this is the right space for having our little red restaurant here sandy was totally cooperative and loved the idea
7206157 i thought it was a great opportunity for phamaly to create a new piece of theater that really inspires people is nonpartisan and gets a positive political message out there about being civically engaged
7206158 when it seems like everything is going to fall apart they figure out the key to working together as an ensemble is what we call showing up as yourself
7206159 the staff did such a great job but the last thing you want is 12 people in an operating room looking into your brain and no one is smiling
7206160 had a bunch of holes in it and so it had basically reconfigured itself
7206161 and its finally a word i can look forward to using
7206162 weve had four record setting years in a row and the fifth year is a near certainty
7206163 you are ready to enter the api design world and this book will help you explore it

7206167 the adoption of appropriate information behaviour to identify through whatever channel or medium information well fitted to information needs leading to wise and ethical use of information in society
7206168 sometimes i feel a little jealous inside imagining someone else could please you more than me i guess its my insecurity acting up a bit because i know im not the most beautiful most fun or even the most exciting person youll ever meet but i do know that no matter how hard and long you search youll never find someone who loves you as much as i do
7206169 obama is such a loser what a liar etc etc
7206170 there are people here yearning to live in peace with us yearning for freedom
7206171 all these restrictions theyre not just for security reasons theyre symptomatic to something much much deeper

7206173 we were pretty cut off from the world while we were on the boat
7206174 its accuracy in distinguishing actual or potential security violators from innocent test takers is insufficient to justify reliance on its use in employee security screening in federal agencies
7206175 polygraph testing as currently used has extremely serious limitations in such screening applications if the intent is both to identify security risks and protect valued employees
7206176 right now the polygraph is the best tool they have at their hands but its not a tool thats without problems

7206190 la corte suprema de justicia tiene reconocida la calidad de sujeto de derecho del ni o a n no nacido sin condicionarlo a su nacimiento con vida una vez salvada esta cuesti n por el m ximo int rprete de la constituci n nacional no queda otra que reafirmar la protecci n del ni o por nacer desde el mismo momento de la concepci n hasta su nacimiento para cuidarlo de cualquier manipulaci n agraviante o maniobra abortiva de cualquier naturaleza
7206191 no estar a dado al estado no reconocer el derecho a la vida porque es preexistente a toda ley positiva y m s a n al mismo estado
7206192 por qu hemos de soslayar una f rmula garantista para defender el m s importante de los derechos humanos cuando as hemos actuado con otros derechos humanos de todos modos esto es mejor que nada celebro que el consenso haya permitido reafirmar que en entre r os la vida existe y ser protegida desde su concepci n
7206193 el derecho a la vida es le derecho primigenio fundante de todos los derechos su respeto permite continuar esta aventura de la humanidad los l mites del derecho a la vida tienen que ser cada vez m s restrictivos
7206194 las acciones destinadas a acompa ar el proceso natural de la muerte respetar el proceso natural de la muerte y la dignidad de la persona es ortotanasia y es ese el concepto que inspir a los convencionales

7206197 el derecho a la vida est consagrado en el derecho positivo argentino desde el c digo civil hasta la convenci n internacional del ni o reserva que hicimos en el senado de la naci n a propuesta del convencional que habla y que fue insertada dentro de los tratados internacionales signados por nuestro pa s en la constituyente del 94 pr cticamente por unanimidad tambi n el despacho habla de muerte digna y para el que habla muerte digna es la que se produce con la debida y adecuada asistencia m dica familiar amistosa y espiritual he querido dejar constancia con estas pocas palabras porque consider que era una obligaci n que el convencional brasesco del 2008 en entre r os ratifique lo que dijo como senador de la naci n al plantear la reserva de la convenci n internacional del ni o
7206198 una vida digna tiene que ser coronada con una muerte digna que es exactamente lo que la convencional cepeda indic

7206212 eventually when you consolidate the ftas it is possible that you could end up with something like that an asia wide fta
7206213 substantial gains could be realised from consolidating the many ftas into a single region wide one
7206214 governments need to connect the poor to the thriving regional economy by eliminating labour market barriers investing in workers capabilities and building infrastructure to connect disadvantaged regions with economic centres
7206215 we are witnessing the beginnings of a strong prosperous outward looking asian economic community regionally integrated yet connected with global markets and with responsibility and influence to match its economic weight

7206251 syrias bad negotiating position is leading it to look for more weapons and to try to grow more teeth before returning to the table with israel

7206257 is really to find out will this guy play ball will he be cooperative when we need him

7206264 even if i disagree with an issue i dont want them voting against mine
7206265 where we agree with the planning board we vote as a bloc
7206266 where i disagree with the board you have to go into each one
7206267 so i have to tell planners ahead of time what im going to do or they would never have time to put it together

7206269 the firm is one of the most respected law firms in the world
7206270 this international global leader is noted for corporate intellectual property litigation tax international and other practice areas
7206271 i love helping legal secretaries get new jobs and it should always be a positive rewarding and exciting experience when you start with a new law firm
7206272 my clients are the top 40 law firms in new york city the top 25 in the united states and the top 11 in the world these firms offer great salaries bonuses and healthy work environments
7206273 im always here for my legal secretarial clients and i believe that being honest realistic and sincere about what you want and need in your new job is the best way to start a relationship i even work on the weekends to make sure my clients are happy
7206274 send me your resume and well talk about your experience as it relates to openings in a few different firms an 800 or 150 attorney law firm can be a proper match its not all about size its all about your comfort skills experience and the professional relationship you prefer with the attorney and the culture of the law firm im here to offer you professional and sincere service that is specialized for the new york legal secretary
7206275 i always treat people the way i would want to be treated if i were looking for a job
7206276 its important to listen to people to establish their wants and needs in a new job
7206277 most of my time is spent trying to make matches for my clients and legal applicants who are seeking jobs in the top law firms in new york city since everyone does not want a large firm i always give my candidates a realistic perspective they appreciate a lot of my clients seek legal word processing operators and legal secretaries who like an intimate setting in boutique firms
7206278 its always rewarding to see the smile on someones face when they get a new job thats a real match and we all strive to make everyone happy at filcro
7206279 many of us at filcro legal staffing come from non legal recruitment environments and from a human resource perspective the proper match for a legal secretary is quite a sophisticated process
7206280 theyre charging a lot of money for something the homeowners dont need to be paying those kinds of sums for
7206281 we have several suits currently pending against people who were purporting to offer foreclosure rescue and in fact took the houses
7206282 we werent really doing this last year but there was so much volume that we really felt like we needed to help
7206283 they can sit and surf that net and come up with a lot of data

7206287 curfew is in force please dont come out of your homes
7206288 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7206289 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7206290 they dont really believe that the theater missile defense components in poland and in the czech republic although they are very small are in fact in the end really intended for iran
7206291 the other piece of this is that the russians have opposed the general national military defense program of the united states for a very long time
7206292 and they put the two things together they think this is the camels nose under the tent that the united states is putting in place in alaska now in central europe and who knows where next the components of an effective for a much more extensive ballistic missile defense system that would be directed against russian nuclear capabilities
7206293 the president traveled to georgia august 13 when there was a rally in tbilisi and stood beside georgian president mikhail saakashvili and said now we see the real face of russia
7206294 here is the president of poland clearly suggesting that russia is a serious military threat to all its neighbors that is obviously going to lead to the action that its has taken that is to defend itself as best it can
7206295 the russian military actions in georgia not only broke through whatever resistance the polish government had to doing the deal without getting further satisfaction on the terms of the deal but in addition pushed both sides to build in these extra defensive measures which are clearly directed against russia
7206296 no one raises any question but that the patriot missile battery or batteries that are to be put in poland plus the joint administration and patrolling of them by both u s and polish forces is designed for russia
7206297 if the russians should do anything to attack those missiles and american lives are at risk then that would mean that the debate about whether or not the united states would actually do something to protect members of nato would become academic
7206298 and indeed because american troops were there it would serve as a trigger and the united states would react
7206299 we have to see what kind of amendments come then only we can decide but we cannot accept prescriptive conditionalities

7206480 i grew up in midwest farm country and even then i was intrigued by new ways of farming
7206481 as i grew up i learned that there were new ways to grow fruits vegetables and flowers when i discovered hydroponics it gave me a vision of the future to work towards and now i am asking senators obama and mccain to look to the hydroponics industry as they make their campaigns farm policies
7206482 while mccain and obama have many differences with each other about their farm policies neither of them are considering the numerous benefits of hydroponics
7206483 hydroponics farming receives not one single penny of the millions available in federal subsidies or any other support even though more and more people are staking their future on hydroponics farming
7206484 the european countries are well ahead of the us on this old world technology
7206485 whoever gets elected obama or mccain they ought to consider giving a helping hand to an industry that can create millions of jobs use far less ag chemicals and produce very high yields in very small spaces
7206486 we created advanced nutrients and are now seeing hydroponics catching hold in the suburbs and for commercial farming
7206487 as obama and mccain debate the 300 billion farm bill they ought to consider that hydroponics is the farming wave of the future

7206517 elections have changed dramatically over the years money power and name recognition are the three basic ingredients for a winner whether or not that candidate has any qualifications
7206518 this is fine for the corporate world or the entertainment industry but not for democracy
7206519 voters are bombarded with repetitive subjective messages about the candidates personality and biography
7206520 the system seems designed to focus their attention on what the candidates look like or who is ahead rather than what they promise theyll do for the country with an awareness of the techniques campaigns use and how to find better information people can look beyond what the candidates want them to see and underst and the truth about the people who are looking to represent them and how they propose to represent them
7206521 i kept looking for a skeleton to fall out of the closet and i couldnt find anything i kept wondering why are these guys selling it almost seems like there is too much synergy here
7206522 when my wife and i got married i worked while she went to school we barely had enough to survive just enough for one car payment and an apartment
7206523 i had always been interested in cars but i couldnt afford to buy the components that i wanted for the car so im pretty much self taught on everything i just started learning how to weld and how to fabricate and i used my car as a template
7206524 some of the parts that i built helped it to get better traction at the track
7206525 it was safer and i made the suspension adjustable its not adjustable from the factory
7206526 it kept going that way and i thought maybe i can do something with this
7206527 id worked for people who didnt seem to appreciate me
7206528 this is a manufactured product and there is a heavy design component to it the engineering aspect is very critical i brought all of that experience to the table
7206529 i had a desire to purchase my own business and wanted it to be a small manufacturing company
7206530 i thought it would be a great idea to mix my hobby and my profession
7206531 hes a product designer he has his own shop he develops products on his own time i manufacture and market them he gets a commission based on the sales volume that type of arrangement could blow up in many types of situations but i think its going to work out great for us
7206532 allan miller wanted to run a business but he didnt know how to design the product the seller brett rockey wanted to design the product but he didnt want to run the business
7206533 the job of an m amp a intermediary is to bring buyer and seller together and let the chemistry and the personalities work together to bring an offer to a deal
7206534 this has to be one of most satisfying deals that ive ever done because of the way we were able to put two people together and find a transaction structure that met both of their objectives
7206535 the economic consequences of this policy can result in larger companies vertically integrating their operations in order to avoid higher taxes pyramiding punishes companies that are small or unable to integrate it also results in a lack of transparency particularly for the consumer as the cost of the many b amp o taxes levied on the end product is indecipherable from the cost of the product itself

7206537 if it wasnt for what the canadian economy has been doing in recent years things would be real slow in whatcom county
7206538 condo spaces have become more popular because of the affordability factor and the benefit of sharing a common area
7206539 there are some spaces that fit a companys needs where the mortgage is the same or less than leasing
7206540 i think that is a trend youll see continue in the coming years
7206541 in the area along pacific highway north of bellingham you have less easy access to i 5 but there is industrial land you can work with
7206542 once you buy it you own it and if the business takes off it might be hard to adjust and find more space
7206543 but if you have a mature stable business there are certainly benefits to ownership
7206544 an industrial zone area has the broadest types of uses for a company some use an industrial building to store stuff while others will set up large printing presses
7206545 so while price is a factor companies are looking at a lot of other things first such as height clearance loading docks and office space
7206546 companies tend to have three to five year plans when they are looking at moving into a market then it can take longer to get a space built so they are not as concerned about the current economic situation
7206547 bellingham has been steady but when you have tighter credit it does impact projects

7206596 the goal for the foreseeable future must be for the afghan army and police to ensure security in the country themselves while the international community provides them with support
7206597 there are so many images of afghanistan that the western media will never show these include pictures of normal daily life
7206598 the parliament wont be left without representatives of the opposition
7206599 we dont recognise the results of a poll that was rigged by the authorities
7206600 we already had these kinds of parallel structures in the early nineties and that led the country to civil war
7206601 we will take our decision regarding the opposition memorandum in a few days time
7206602 our party wont remain in parliament alone with the national movement but we also need to clarify issues regarding the alternative parliament
7206603 overall voting was assessed positively by the large majority of international observers
7206604 counting was assessed less positively with significant procedural shortcomings observed as was tabulation
7206605 our observers recorded cases of voters being put under pressure and of observers including our own being put under pressure
7206606 we will soon publish a detailed report on this but we cant say for definite how this influenced the parallel vote count which we conducted
7206607 these businessmen promised people quite specific things for example that a factory would be built in their region jobs created and so on
7206608 these businessmen also spent much more money during the election campaign
7206609 the results of the 21 may election are a good indication of what societys general mood is
7206610 its true that the results in a number of polling stations where gross violations were observed have been annulled and more results may still be annulled but theres no chance of any significant changes
7206611 although we have a constitutional majority in this parliament we are ready to give up important levers of power to the opposition including the positions of heads of parliamentary committees
7206612 i think that the authorities themselves did not want or expect a result like this
7206613 the results were ensured in advance independently of them by the state machine that was up and running as soon as the elections started these results are a challenge to the authorities who are now at a loss and dont know what to do
7206614 i think the opposition is again adopting the wrong tactics by organising an alternative parliament
7206615 the election showed that a large part of the society wont back tough actions like this besides its obvious that the opposition has lost some of its support since the november events when police broke up opposition protests and the presidential election
7206616 but that still doesnt mean we can say the election results are an accurate reflection of the mood of society
7206617 its just that the authorities were able to mobilise their supporters and the opposition wasnt but the mass protests on may 26 showed that the opposition fire has not gone out amongst people
7206618 on the one hand the oppositions new initiatives are doomed to failure they are losing their parliamentary platform on the other hand they are winning back the hearts of those who are unhappy with the authorities

7206642 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7206643 ill be the judge of that cause you see boys they have a tendency of running from me as fast as they can i dont know why

7206677 instead of dam gates we have a rush to open the floodgates for development after last months state hearing on revoking auburn dam water rights
7206678 bike routes on the public lands and housing on private parcels not purchased by the federal government for the dam are a new gold rush
7206679 now the county facility services division wants to take this treasure and develop it
7206680 its proposed at the auburn dam reservoir level since the bor opposes putting it below the auburn dam take line
7206681 the original proposal for a four foot wide route was destructive of the canyon and too dangerous on the steep canyon walls to allow for mixed biker hiker and equestrian use the new six foot wide proposal is also unworkable we support alternate routes and separating different user groups on existing and new trails up through clementine reservoir hikers and equestrians need only a narrow path

7206690 aaaaaaaah josanne is terug aaaah waar heb jij uitgehangen dan
7206691 ik zal het wel gemist hebben maar w t precies was nou de clou van je hele blog
7206692 only one us marine was killed and four injured two non battle related
7206693 the taleban are suffering huge losses they are reinforcing the area in a very disorganised way
7206694 i am not saying there were none only that we have no reports
7206695 our figures show 4 000 displaced persons most of them from before the operation started
7206696 the aid being given by unama united nations assistance mission in afghanistan and unicef un childrens fund cannot meet the needs of the people
7206697 we do not actually have anybody on the ground there
7206698 we left our home and are camping out in the desert
7206699 almost everyone in garmsir is leaving either for pakistan or lashkar gah those who dont have money are just stuck in the desert
7206700 i saw two town ace toyota minivan vehicles full of women and children who were trying to get away
7206701 the cars were bombed and completely destroyed i cannot say how many were killed because we ran and hid but we could see the fire and smoke coming out of them
7206702 when we come here for help they send soldiers to chase us away there is no one to hear our voice we go to the bakeries in the bazaar hoping someone will give us bread so that we can take it to our families
7206703 we have not been able to do anything for the displaced families our first job is to figure out where they are and what they need
7206704 but nobody has attended to their basic needs such as food and tents we have told the red crescent society but they did not help
7206705 they are not being helped last week we helped 280 families with tea flour oil and blankets we have prepared assistance for an additional 700 families but there are many more
7206706 we will try and help them as soon as we can determine where they have gone
7206707 before the beginning of this operation there were 500 foreign fighters in garmsir
7206708 now the number has increased to 1 100 and more are coming every day
7206709 in just one night 25 opposition fighters were killed and 20 of them were arabs
7206710 we were all running and it was dark and i lost my mother and i cried
7206711 but i am afraid there are bombs and airplanes during the night and i want my mother
7206712 i saw old men women children just running trying to save themselves
7206713 no one looked out for their children their parents it was everyone for himself
7206714 because we are taking the fight to the insurgents in their key areas their reaction in garmsir has been intense and resulted in heavy losses on their part
7206715 the afghan citizens hold the insurgents responsible for the hardship they impose
7206716 the only criticism the marines have received is that they are moving too slowly
7206717 naturally we regret any families who have left their homes but once we have re established afghan government control they will return and will enjoy a better quality of life free from the oppressive regime of the taleban
7206718 in districts such as lashkar gah naw zad and garmsir local afghans have started seeing the benefit of a safer environment
7206719 this is the twentieth time ive heard there are military operations in helmand
7206720 when the taleban go to a village they dont usually stay for a long time then the americans come in and launch a military operation counting civilian casualties as their military achievement when they leave the area the taleban come back in this doesnt make any sense you cannot stabilise the area this way
7206721 the relatives of those killed join the ranks of the enemy to exact revenge
7206722 for a non pashtun even a police or ana commander all these turbaned people look like taleban
7206723 but even if it goes on for four years it will not have any result the americans and nato should revise their policy
7206724 there is no set end date for the operation in garmsir marines will stay until the mission has been accomplished
7206725 and even though the marines are not in garmsir permanently nato and its forces remain committed to the mission there
7206726 the lawyer introduced the motion to have parwez examined one week ago but the judge would not consider it
7206727 he said the motion had to be read in open court
7206728 we expected that he would be released but now i dont know what will happen
7206729 anyone leaving the court today would assume that the charges were correct
7206730 they should have been given the chance to read their defence statement
7206731 there have been many violations of the law according to sharia islamic law even if someone converts to another faith he has three days to repent if he apologises he is set free
7206732 if the meetings continue and the sides achieve their goals it wont be long before we see a turkish consulate opening in erbil
7206733 we wont let iraqi kurdistans land be used for attacks against turkey
7206734 the pkk issue is an internal turkish issue and has nothing to do with iraqi kurds
7206735 we tried to import materials into the region through the turkish border and have been denied several times because of the tensions between turkey and kurdistan region
7206736 it is very important for us that turkey and kurds have the best relations possible because we can invest more in the region
7206737 the kurdistan region needs turkey in order to get a foothold in the middle east
7206738 until now many turks and other middle eastern countries consider kurdistan an alien entity that might damage the region
7206739 if we know that the krg is taking a side in the turkish pkk issue and that move is against the interests of the kurdish people then we will stand against it
7206740 turkey wants to eliminate the pkk and they want to use the kurdish parties as means to achieve that goal
7206741 the kurdish leadership needs to be really careful in dealing with turkey since turkey was created it has been against kurds so i suspect that they wont be good to us
7206742 the earlier they start working on the situation the more options they have
7206743 with easy credit they built a house of cards and with one breeze it all tumbles down
7206744 lenders want people to stay in their houses and they dont want the expense of foreclosure
7206745 our overall goal is to provide top quality cell phone accessories of all kinds at everyday low prices while proving excellent shopping experiences online for each and every customer
7206746 just isnt right it isnt fair and it doesnt give people the impression of what were about
7206747 receberam instru es de ser firmes sem usar for a desnecess ria
7206748 i am ready to give up all my medals to the institutions from which i received them ill give my presidential medal back to the president and my government one back to the government
7206749 when our commanders are in prison i am ashamed to hang these pieces of metal on my chest
7206750 we must never do this destroy yerkrapah not today tomorrow or in 100 years time
7206751 the fact that members of yerkrapah have been arrested does not mean that they are being persecuted for belonging to yerkrapah the law enforcement agencies are obliged to take into custody people who commit crimes and extraneous circumstances are irrelevant our country will always need the yerkrapah union
7206752 i believe that the authorities are carrying out a pre planned operation to destroy yerkrapah as a structure as a single force as they see it as a danger
7206753 arresting dozens of yerkrapah members laying trumped up charges against them and forcing others to leave yerkrapah is all in pursuit of the same goal the ruin and destruction of yerkapah
7206754 the destruction of yerkrapah does great harm to the whole of society effectively destroying the idea of serving the country on a voluntary basis
7206755 it has an effect both on the moral and psychological atmosphere in the country and on the karabakh question this policy will be felt in the military political balance with azerbaijan and will increase the risk of a resumption of war
7206756 in 1998 vazgen sarkisian used massive manipulations in the election and the yerkrapah union was his support base the very same yerkrapah made robert kocharian president now its role has substantially diminished and a new generation of politicians has appeared
7206757 in the current circumstances it was a serious problem for our regime to have the kind of organisation you keep an eye on but cant control
7206758 at the end of 2007 or the beginning of 2008 it became clear that this organisation was not under control
7206759 ill be the judge of that cause you see boys they have a tendency of running from me as fast as they can i dont know why
7206760 omg josanne heb je de nacht overleeft ben je nog ben je niet neergestoken door het ingebeelde screammasker met een slagersmes verzwolgen door de lesbische muggen enzo

7206763 fok zoveel hebik nog nooit gedacht in n blog maar ik geloof niet dat ik je mobiel heb
7206764 ill go back to school the first chance i get but for the time being i will respect my parents decision
7206765 the rates of girls leaving schools have soared recently due to the deteriorating security situation and the fear that girls will be targeted by terrorists
7206766 i forced my daughter to drop out of school to protect her from gangs and terrorists
7206767 it hurts me to see her so sad because she had to quit school we want all our children to be educated and get good jobs in the future
7206768 its better than if they go to school and get hurt our family traditions do not allow girls to go to school sending girls out of the house and mixing with strangers will taint their reputations and the familys honour
7206769 the issues of illiteracy will have a huge impact on the girls and even when they get married it will have a bearing on their children because these future mothers might continue the tradition of their families and keep their daughters at home
7206770 in the future there will be a huge class of uneducated women and that will affect their children
7206771 these girls will spend the rest of their lives working in their homes and will marry whomever their parents want
7206772 these issues are considered family issues and the families make decisions
7206773 the idea is that organisations dont have the right to interfere with family issues
7206774 ill be the judge of that cause you see boys they have a tendency of running from me as fast as they can i dont know why
7206775 i dont think that we were just going through the motions before
7206776 i mean we were losing tough games and yesterdays was the first one where we just got blown out
7206777 tonight we got up early and got the focus back were not going to be too hard on ourselves if we lose a few tough games but theres nobody in here whos going out there not caring if we win or lose
7206778 that was supposed to be a sac fly he just misplayed it
7206779 thats an out in any mans game most guys catch that ball
7206780 teixeiras just absolutely killing everything we throw and hes on every pitch
7206781 you look at the stats and they say vladdy hits into some double plays so youve got to take a chance but thats pick your poison right there i would bet you wouldnt want to do that too many times a year walk anybody to get to vladdy
7206782 in the past id gotten a couple of hits off his offspeed pitches but tonight i noticed that his fastball was working really well so i was just looking for something hard the entire at bat
7206783 i didnt even think about thursday at all i just went out and played my game
7206784 maybe once or twice a year i have a little fluke like that im human and that kind of humbles me a little bit today i felt rejuvenated and ready to go
7206785 i think a day out of the outfield yesterday as the dh kind of helped me a little bit and i was able to run today
7206786 i didnt have any hits so i made sure nobody else wound have any
7206787 we dont expect to do to spain what we did last time
7206788 its a brand new game were not an overconfident team but we are confident
7206789 but they jump higher they run faster theyre stronger youve got to play ugly and make them feel uncomfortable thats the only way

7206802 mathematics in israel flourishes today on this high international plane its lifeblood is the free exchange of ideas with scholars visiting teaching learning from each other travelling everywhere in the world
7206803 but this is not so in occupied palestine where education struggles to continue and travel is greatly limited
7206804 access to education determines how the next generation of palestinians will grow up specifically whether potential mathematicians will have the opportunity to join the international community
7206805 education for people in the occupied territories gives them a future the alternative is chaos
7206806 i have tremendous regard for israel which is without a doubt a major force in the mathematics world but unfortunately the palestinians cannot take part in this prosperity

7206852 that really changed the dads mind about how wise kids are using technology
7206853 his point was that schools shouldnt ban the use of the devices but learn from the students and also create an environment that promotes technology
7206854 its exciting but i think we need to stay focused on what the outcomes are for kids as far as content
7206855 if a student brings their own laptop is it going to be on the schools network then what about viruses and filtering
7206856 im not sure schools are quite comfortable with it yet
7206857 one of the things weve talked about in proctor and west rutland because we have the small schools is maintaining the diversity of classes with a low enrollment with the camera software we could perhaps offer the class at one school and have students at the other taking it
7206858 what people are most excited about and interested in is all the negative stuff out there i liken the experience to taking your kids to washington d c there are streets that you better not let them go down and there are others that they shouldnt die without seeing
7206859 how do you accommodate the students that dont have the technology how do you equalize the access
7206860 its a way we can introduce math concepts without any kind of stress on the student without them having to memorize a bunch of rules first

7206895 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
7206896 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
7206897 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too

7206902 in the case of iraq the americans had a big strategic rethink about how they were handling it
7206903 that kind of rethink is whats going to have to take place with afghanistan
7206904 now that the situation is changing in iraq they are heading to a new front which is the one in afghanistan
7206905 its not unusual for bears to be swimming but depending on their condition and how much time theyre spending in the water this could be problematic its going to cost them more energy to swim through water than travel on land
7206906 there were some years when some bears may have had to swim as far as 100 miles
7206907 now the ice is much farther offshore more consistently and for longer so the possibility of long distances between land and sea ice is much greater

7206909 whenever we took the plane down from washington to texas the president would change into what he called his chocolate suit not a suit in a classic sense but a light brown western shirt and trousers and he would start being a different person right there right off the bat
7206910 he was more relaxed at the ranch you saw a complete difference in his attitude the things he thought about the things he talked about it was a completely different situation
7206911 lyndon johnson was a gregarious person who did not like to be hemmed in but during those last two or three years the white house became like a prison to him
7206912 but in texas he felt he could be open and himself and reach out it was a liberating effect for him being on that ranch
7206913 lyndon johnson was an insightful guy but he is not what i would call an introspective person
7206914 he wanted a crowd when he drove around the ranch in his car it was always with somebody never by himself never ever ever by himself
7206915 biden owes his selection to russian prime minister vladimir putin
7206916 russias invasion of georgia reinforced the american worry about international tensions
7206917 vladimir putins contribution to american politics he is a necessary antidote to the obama lack of worldly wisdom which before georgia was a bit academic to most americans
7206918 took the 3 a m call obama needs a pal who can do the same
7206919 basically this is an internal american affair but it is giving us cause for concern because biden was clear in his calls to divide iraq according to sectarian and ethnic lines
7206920 because it is the iraqi people who will have the last say about their future
7206921 an exceptionally good decision which shows how obama is trying to organize all elements of the democratic party behind him

7206941 what it looks like we are getting is a maliki government that wont behave itself and wants to crush the sons of iraq
7206942 just last week the prime minister gave his personal commitment to the program
7206943 they are well aware of the sacrifices the sons of iraq have made that they were a critical element in bringing the security situation under control and that it is in their strategic advantage to assimilate them peacefully and orderly into iraqi society
7206944 our goal is that by june 2009 the sons of iraq are out of business
7206945 we have the same problems around the country we cant just create a program to pay some people and not others

7206980 as como hemos colaborado con este problema que aqueja a la naci n demandamos que no se utilice electoralmente la problem tica de la inseguridad y rechazamos el abuso en la conjunci n de la sociedad cuando se pretende desconocer que en el combate al crimen organizado y al narcotr fico que ha generado esta secuela de inseguridad se asuma que son otros ordenes de gobierno a los que corresponde enfrentarlo

7207010 what happens when you get what you want the growing blogosphere angst
7207011 i just look at each one as an individual case
7207012 people have blogs that become very popular maybe blogging is just the activity of posting content to the web some blogs are journalism and some arent
7207013 gnomedex founder chris pirillo is good at keeping an audience why because he writes good stuff either you write good stuff or you write crap bottom line
7207014 i consider my blog a loss leader for my other businesses
7207015 i do all of those things but ultimately my blog is the heart of it
7207016 from the beginning of my blog in 2004 i decided its not about driving traffic its about driving influence
7207017 from the beginning i said i wasnt going to overblog i was only going to blog when i had something to say
7207018 is that the audience is starting to follow me its really about people wanting to hear what i have to say
7207019 the principal advantage is persistence that you would be there all the time
7207020 a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day and one of those is at night so its only really getting a snapshot of activity zephyr would be watching all day

7207022 we have one more step of improvements we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months and we want to push the performance

7207062 pity the nation that wears a cloth it does not weave eats a bread it does not harvest and drinks a wine that flows not from its own winepress
7207063 pity the nation that acclaims the bully as hero and that deems the glittering conqueror bountiful
7207064 pity the nation that raises not its voice save when it walks in a funeral boasts not except among its ruins and will rebel not save when its neck is laid between the sword and the block
7207065 i do miss that i get my fair share when we get out to the west coast
7207066 here they have their cheese steaks you can only eat so many of them
7207067 but nobody probably would have suspected id be here either
7207068 it came down to the opportunity to go to college during college age
7207069 they said i could always go back i wanted a normal college experience i figured if baseball was meant to be there would still be that opportunity after college
7207070 it breaks down to their level how to be safe on the internet
7207071 with the younger grades its cartoon based and it really works well because they understand whats going on
7207072 it shows you what youre not supposed to do and who youre not supposed to talk to
7207073 i thought that kids my age would benefit from seeing the real true stories on there how she was victimized i thought it was real good
7207074 thats why were putting a lot of our attending on educating parents

7207078 getting into a car with anything to drink is wrong dangerous and unacceptable
7207079 im 19 but no matter how old you are you should take responsibility for your actions which i will do
7207080 its been quite candidly pretty tough some of the time for me in my new job
7207081 but seriously cbs and couric should be pleased who wouldnt take an audience gain of 28 400 viewers these days and feel good about it
7207082 to see us gaining and making strides in some of these major markets is wonderful news
7207083 ive always felt proud of the broadcast even in the early days when it was so criticized for certain elements im one of these people who thinks its ok to take chances and to try things i always thought even the things that werent well received were noble efforts in trying to evolve the broadcast so the fact that were doing well is very gratifying
7207084 i think one of the most exciting aspects of my coming to this job was the chance to spread my wings on the internet
7207085 i think anybody who hasnt been living under a rock for the last 10 years understands how news consumption is changing dramatically and how the internet is playing an increasingly important role im a naturally interactive person in terms of my personal style and were trying to reach out to folks
7207086 on the internet its a much different sensibility they want it a little more raw less filtered less varnished and i think that plays to my strengths its sort of more of a today show sensibility in terms of being relaxed or being able to make a mistake or laugh at yourself or ask an off the wall question i always thought that hopefully i could be a successful bridge between traditional media and the internet just in terms of the way i communicate in a more casual way
7207087 even given the gains in cities like baltimore the question is can they build on them and improve the national ratings
7207088 they have to do that first and it takes time the question then becomes how long couric and cbs are willing to stick with it
7207089 i think she has been caught up in the desperate efforts of tv news to try to retain audience through an ill considered meshing of solid journalism and mush that has no true constituency i think couric is knowledgeable about the world and if she were allowed to do a harder edged newscast she might fare better
7207090 i have no plans to leave i want to do the best job i possibly can for cbs news i care about our newscast and my colleagues and i have no plans to split
7207091 a lot of people like to write about well shell leave here or shell leave there but thats never been an issue here
7207092 our managements been completely behind her and the correspondents and the producers are completely behind her and she has worked her tail off
7207093 i think the law was not universally applauded so i think school systems have not with the exception of baltimore city been particularly proponents
7207094 charters are out there to provide innovations and sometimes traditional public schools are not the answer for every child
7207095 some of them have done extremely well and some are struggling
7207096 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
7207097 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
7207098 whats wrong with married couples having hot and holy sex
7207099 people carry a lot of guilt from parents who said sex is bad
7207100 we help them couples to have a healthy sex life one of the things we cover in scripture is how to meet each others needs in bed
7207101 there are books even from christians who love jesus that talk about all the pleasures and joys and the anatomical structure of the body and the ways to please your spouse and to have the most joy
7207102 and you know what i would whole heartedly encourage it
7207103 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
7207104 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
7207105 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
7207106 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
7207107 because i know i took care of them they had a good life
7207108 my parents have always said they would be a little upset if we didnt feel something when we get rid of them
7207109 and it is sad its hard to part with them but its part of a balanced diet and you know going into the market projects that this is what theyre destined for
7207110 4 h gets their feet on the ground so they can pretty much handle any curveball thrown at them
7207111 i bought the tape some years ago of wartime radio broadcasts from radio yesteryear and nowhere on the liner notes does it mention kate smith singing in baltimore
7207112 of course i grew up in the war years and every time smith sung god bless america it gave me goose bumps especially when she hits those high notes it still does
7207113 during the broadcast she honors a young war widow from baltimore and every time i listen to it i wonder if she could possibly still be alive
7207114 the singer wearing a fur coat and orchids was greeted loudly by the men many of whom were seated high on cranes and construction frames overlooking the officials stand
7207115 in each is the purpose the will to achieve the will of the men and women of america to take steel and wood and paint and assemble them into a ship for our country
7207116 usually at this point we salute a hero of battle tonight our spotlight turns on a young woman whose name belongs beside those heroes on our roll of honor
7207117 here beside me is pretty brown haired jacqueline gloria precht a war widow at the age of 19 who works proudly as a solderer in the radio division of bendix aviation here in baltimore maryland
7207118 this young girl was stunned when the navy announced last november the death of her husband a naval gunner in the merchant marine six other members of her family are now in war production work and jacqueline sought war work immediately after hearing that her husband had been killed in action
7207119 she has become a valuable contributor to victory and america is proud of jacqueline precht
7207120 we salute her now we offer her our thanks and as a memento of the occasion we offer a dozen roses the symbol of our spotlight for workers fighters and marchers to victory
7207121 this south korean director is a big michelangelo antonioni fan
7207122 look for the riskiest film in town and see it it might be your next favorite film
7207123 you end up realizing there is a strategy being worked out between hezbollah syria and iran and they have actually managed to make quite strong headway in the last few days
7207124 the president spoke in jerusalem a week ago about standing up to dictators and not appeasing those who used force
7207125 he isnt home a week and the dictators and the forces of violence have triumphed
7207126 what we have is not a complete win or loss but a new accommodation certainly with more influence for hezbollah so its a nuanced outcome but still it is a setback for the government
7207127 whether it has in fact suffered a strategic loss in many ways we will only know with the result of the next parliamentary election
7207128 the idea that they will give up on all of that in order to get the golan is ludicrous
7207129 save our families and brothers from saudi arabias unpredictable verdicts
7207130 its well known that no demonstrations are allowed in syria unless they have a green light from the authorities this appears to be a move against the saudi government
7207131 particularly in view of the saudis hostile political attitude toward syria
7207132 the hostility has moved from the two regimes to the two people thats crazy
7207133 an educated militant lady such as dr fidaa al hourani has been suffering from sickness and imprisonment for more than three months her palestinian husband dr gazi al alyan has been deported no one is hearing her suffering her retching or even her roaring so im offering myself to the security services on the condition that this fine woman the head of the damascus declaration is released i do this so that history wouldnt say that the proud syrian people no longer has any gentlemen and doesnt respond to the voices of our women
7207134 i am ready to take place in jail this is an honor to me as an arab society we dont accept a woman staying in jail without getting any help
7207135 this decision coupled with the syrian high courts verdict to uphold mr labwanis earlier 12 year sentence for calling for political reform demonstrates the syrian regimes contempt for human rights freedom of expression and the rule of law
7207136 a very very lonely place it takes a very very special person like anwar al bunni to confront the extraordinary range of forces arrayed against him
7207137 it is very important for anwars work and sacrifice to be recognized for him to be seen as a defender of human rights it will remind the world there are prisoners of conscience in syria
7207138 confiscated all his writing materials and said he was not permitted to write
7207139 part of our talks with the syrians included the 400 000 palestinian refugees in syria and they indicated a willingness to consider nationalizing them this will then likely make it easier to promote the same in lebanon
7207140 if i had won the booker the regime would have had a huge problem
7207141 i think the culture minister breathed a big sigh when i lost
7207142 the main thing i wanted to get at was the struggle of two fundamentalisms
7207143 i remember that heaviness that feeling of death dominating the whole city you were always surrounded by armed men who agreed on only one thing if youre not with us youre against us
7207144 hatred possessed me i was excited by it i felt it was saving me it gave me a sense of superiority i had been seeking for a long time
7207145 banning books is normal for us here its funny even a little absurd
7207146 he fluttered his hands in mock anxiety a book is not better just because it has been banned he said and western talk of censorship seems to strike him as a little moralistic
7207147 so you might call them why the hell did you censor my book
7207148 we dont want to live outside syria and we know how to avoid this
7207149 for me aleppo was the main struggle because the violence there happened over a long period of time not overnight like in hama
7207150 syria has a long history as a cosmopolitan and commercial place its traditions are tolerant and diverse
7207151 this is what prevented the victory of the islamists in the 1980s
7207152 we havent had a setback like this in 1 000 years
7207153 has grown and penetrated our society especially among the young
7207154 if what happened in the 1980s were to happen again i think the islamists would win
7207155 this is the ghost of normal everyday assumptions which declares that the ultimate purpose of life which is to keep alive is impossible but that this is the ultimate purpose of life anyway so that great minds struggle to cure diseases so that people may live longer but only madmen ask why one lives longer in order that he may live longer there is no other purpose that is what the ghost says
7207156 oh god were so sorry with laughing like that it just looked so funny im sure it was just an accident on your fault
7207157 it wasnt an accident at all i did it on purpose
7207158 hes been letching over the both of you for the last half an hour so i thought i would punish him for it
7207159 if you want to punish him for letching over you both feel free to punish him for it right between the legs with your racquets
7207160 i think these two girls are the ones you should be apologizing too darling
7207161 shut up stand still and keep your legs open wanker
7207162 he can take more than that feel free to use him for a few more minutes target practice if you want
7207163 you wont have to come anymore to tennis and be humiliated like this as those two girls offered to practice with me from now on come on get up ill drive home tonight as i dont think you will capable of it really
7207164 what a pity darling i was going to allow you play with your 3 incher tonight but somehow i dont think you will be capable will you
7207165 i think that you will find that the british economy is resilient
7207166 we have got to take people through these difficult economic times we have done it before and we will do it again
7207167 you cant expect people to be cheering in the streets if you have oil prices rising and food prices rising
7207168 i know we moved the ball but im sure theres plenty of corrections to make and things to learn from so we have to keep taking it one day at a time and keep getting better
7207169 there were some plays that he probably would have liked to have back but that is pretty much true for everyone
7207170 there is always some positive plays and some that we can improve on and that goes for all of us
7207171 i thought matt did a good job at leading the team and the opportunities he had
7207172 he hung in there he took a few hits but he stepped up and threw the ball
7207173 i enjoy playing the games so its good to be out on the field with your teammates competing in an environment other than practice
7207174 its fun to compete against other teams so i was enjoying myself
7207175 football is a game thats played with emotion i really enjoy playing the game and competing im a pretty laidback person but i do get excited on the field and i thought we put a good drive together and i thought it was cause for celebration with all the guys who helped make it happen
7207176 so theres going to be plenty of mistakes for me to work on
7207177 and theres a lot of room for improvement and weve got to put a better game together and put more points on the board to win
7207178 we compete against each other every day and every time out is an opportunity to compete and earn your peers respect
7207179 i try to work hard because theres guys in this locker room who are much more established than most of the other guys in the locker room and the effort they put into it and the amount of work they put into it is above and beyond
7207180 i always try to show them the respect by putting the same into it and competing hard
7207181 cest agr able d crire lhistoire du sport k nyan ici

7207185 the first day we get there on friday therell be a last chance qualifier so anybody who didnt make it in yet can play in the big tournament on saturday
7207186 but every year theyve had a world championship weve both been in it starting with the one in seattle in 2001 weve been to florida last year was in hawaii and two in california i finished second in the world in one of those
7207187 when i was 3 ben really liked the tv show and then he found out about the cards and we started playing go fish with pokemon cards just to learn them
7207188 weve won all sorts of stuff like packs of cards bags and deck boxes card protectors sometimes if you do well enough you get a paid trip which is pretty nice and weve won a lot of scholarship money too
7207189 they have three age brackets this year the masters are for people 15 and over so born in 1992 or earlier seniors are 11 to 14 so 1993 to 96 and then juniors are anybody 10 or under so born in 1997 or after
7207190 its tougher just because there are more people but its more or less a lot of luck if you have the right card at the right time
7207191 but sometimes people in japan get all of the cards really quickly and translate them and then put the lists online so you know which ones are the good ones already
7207192 hey maybe this stuff is getting a little too old
7207193 well i dont think theres any question that if certain players dont play then other players are going to get more of an opportunity to play whatever spot that is
7207194 that includes matt cassel and gute and kevin i think most will have an opportunity to perform and contribute and show what they can do
7207195 last night we saw a little over a half with cassel and a little less than a half with gute and next week against the giants im sure well see kevin get a chance to play some
7207196 tom if we decide to play him then thatll be an opportunity for him
7207197 if its not and he doesnt play or if we dont decide to play him then itll be an opportunity for somebody else
7207198 its the same thing we talked about last year with randy moss you like to have everybody out there all the time the players who are work hard to get better and the players who arent work hard to get back out there as soon as they can so that they can work with their teammates
7207199 so everybody is in one of those two categories and whichever one theyre in theyre trying to make the most of it to improve
7207200 i think theres probably a couple of plays where you could attribute it to that
7207201 overall id say that philadelphia has a good defense and theyre well coached and they have a good scheme and i think they created some situations for us that were less than optimum and we had a little trouble handling
7207202 it was a combination of things i think our offensive line got a little bit better as the game went along but we need to get off to a faster start and be more productive earlier than weve been in the last couple of weeks so i dont want to minimize that
7207203 time is running real short and were just going to have to work our way through it and work and get better as a total offensive unit not just the linemen but the backs and the tight ends and all the people who are involved
7207204 i thought at the end of the game offensively we were able to string some positive plays together more so than we were the first half and some of that was the receivers making some catches
7207205 chad and c j jones both went up and very aggressively got balls that were good catches ray ventrone had some good catch and run plays and i thought he ran hard with the ball after he caught it tight ends
7207206 overall the receivers made some plays whether it was going up aggressively to catch the ball or catch and run type of plays a couple of red area conversions a couple of third down conversions a couple of long balls so that was encouraging because you like to see receivers go up and get the ball regardless of what quarter it is or whos guarding them or whos throwing it or anything else
7207207 those were positives probably a little better than we had in the two previous games
7207208 i think hes having a good camp and hes kicking the ball well
7207209 he had a good offseason and he had a good spring and hes been pretty consistent all the way through this year going back to may
7207210 we know more about it now we have a least a game under our belts to try and figure out whats the best way to utilize it how to make it advantageous and how to keep it from being a problem or another log on the fire that we really dont need

7207280 unfortunately aariks injury reared its ugly head on his second jump
7207281 for quite a while now hes been jumping with multiple fractures in his leg and the injury was reignited in the worst way the jump counted though aarik limped into the pit visibly in pain but at this point after the third jump it was clear the pain was badly affecting him and he was short of the 17 10 meters needed to qualify for the finals
7207282 were all so proud of what hes done being counted as an olympian is a feat most of us will never attain
7207283 once hes had time to heal we can only imagine some fantastic things to come

7207304 i guess i just cant stand how jack neo deliberately make sures the movie resonates with his target audience the patriarch the antagonistic daughter in law the neglected aged mother its just so obvious theres nothing to interpret nothing to dissect nothing to read into it might be appalling and controversial to the average singaporean who complains in hushed whispers but it doesnt exactly shock me hes not presenting reality in a fresh and interesting way hes just mimicking it and it bores me

7207307 but theirs is a longer hand because they live in trees and their arms are very long
7207308 but this is happening over millions of years with humans if im lucky i might see four generations in my lifetime
7207309 then whatever we evolved from where did it evolve from
7207310 how does our hand go from being that long to just a smaller hand
7207311 individuals with small hands will have more children while those with bigger hands will disappear
7207312 but if we came from them why are they still around
7207313 just because a new population evolves doesnt mean the old one dies out

7207320 i dont think just anyone can live in the desert it takes a certain person to see the beauty here
7207321 one of the reasons i came back is because my family needed me
7207322 i wanted to be an artist i dreamed about maybe moving to new york but i felt the pull to stay here it really has been a wonderful life
7207323 we go to the river a lot and always stop in for dinner or a malt

7207360 it seems that as an excuse for rejecting things african many of our people pretend that they cant connect with continental africa and africans because africans sold us into slavery without going into the psychosis of self hatred for those clinging to this excuse i pose this question why did europeans have to kill so many africans have wars with africans and always arrive in africa armed to the teeth if africans were simply for sale then it seems likely that the european would have only needed to back his ship up to the african coast pay the african slave merchants a few pounds load up the slaves and sail off to the americas why kill anyone

7207369 conformity is one of the nihilistic temptations of rebellion which dominate a large part of our intellectual history it demonstrates how the rebel who takes to action is tempted to succumb if he forgets his origins to the most absolute conformity and so explains the twentieth century

7207371 in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility because the broad masses of a nation more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large scale falsehoods it would never come into their heads to fabricate colossal untruths and they would not believe that others could have the impudence to distort the truth so infamously
7207372 i believe the problem is institutional that individually almost everyone in the industry would rather do something very original than something imitative but the huge budgets and corporate decision making structures push us into the same narrow alleys
7207373 a dwarven warrior a wwii soldier a dwarven warrior a wwii soldier a dwarven warrior well you get it
7207374 so why do we seem to keep making the same few games over and over and over again
7207375 innovation is what has got us from pong to rock band its true so we have had a lot of innovation but have we had enough innovation lately
7207376 one of the few shining lights of innovation in the past few years
7207377 you could argue the wii is a technical innovation not a creative innovation id argue it was a marriage of the two
7207378 arent you tired of going through that conversation over and over again
7207379 isnt it just more interesting and fun to work on something new rather than something exactly the same as the last game you produced or the last ten games
7207380 lets get that fun back lets get that passion back its our industry lets take it back
7207381 i feel like were squandering the promise of games weve been saying for years that its an art form but then we as an industry do as much as we can to disprove what were saying
7207382 i like violent games as much as the next non psychopathic gamer but with the whole range of human experience is there nothing else nothing else that we can concentrate on it would be like if the film industry did nothing but big budget blockbusters we can do better than this we should be doing better than this
7207383 every time weve settled for the easy idea rather than search for the harder innovative idea or every time as a gamer in a store youve reached for the sequel rather than the new game next to it everyone is at fault to some extent and shame on us
7207384 we need to fight conservative ideas at every point from brainstorming to pitch meetings even just when talking to a friend be subversive if you invent a better mousetrap other developers will see it and theyll use it and the innovation will spread until its the standard and be an evangelist
7207385 already a million flowers are starting to bloom and genetic mutation just has to occur i know my talk has been a little pessimistic but personally im very optimistic the games industry as we know it may go away but games arent going to the best is yet to come
7207386 yep this is exactly what this situation would look like
7207387 roth and his actors and novelist alexander stuarts screenplay understand these people and their situation down to the final nuance and are willing to let silence timing and visuals reveal what dialogue would cheapen
7207388 if they cared about our business and our employees they would do more to keep us in the city
7207389 theyve said they want to keep us in the city but their actions suggest otherwise

7207405 i look at it as being realistic and not getting stuck in ideology but doing what is right for the state at this time
7207406 is that it dont you have anything on that list even slightly warm and fuzzy you know something people can wrap their arms around and actually want to protect

7207413 we will get 1 million 150 mpg plug in hybrids on our roads within six years

7207417 barack a choisi joe biden comme notre candidat la vice pr sidence
7207418 un vice pr sident dynamique et d termin qui aidera le s nateur obama la fois gagner la pr sidence et gouverner ce grand pays

7207422 we do not want a civilian president with the same powers that musharraf had mainly the power to dissolve parliament
7207423 our top priority is restoration of the judges and we want it done on monday
7207424 this election is going to be decisive definitely if anwar wins we will be one step closer to taking over the government
7207425 from our assessment we are leading we have to win big it will mean the people reject racial politics
7207426 it is un malay to make these allegations anwar has a family and he has five daughters
7207427 politics is one thing but you are shaming a family man i am afraid that if we go overboard in attacking him and accusing him of anti malay it will backfire we will lose votes we saw that happen in the march polls
7207428 this turmoil is not going to go away quickly and will require serious efforts to overcome it
7207429 a year ago there was a real sense of uncertainty and confusion people were perplexed by the turmoil that had come on quite suddenly i would say the mood this year is one of greater clarity lets call it a bit more somber
7207430 the financial storm that reached gale force some weeks before our last meeting here in jackson hole has not yet subsided and its effects on the broader economy are becoming apparent

7207434 wir bekommen laufend die r ckmeldungen von den tierheimen es wird berall ausgesetzt wie bl d aber wir bem hen uns die qu lerei ber einen datenabgleich mit den finanz mtern einzud mmen wer zurzeit einen brownie bei der steuer als entlaufen abmeldet muss mit zus tzlichen geb hren rechnen denn der grund ist ja offensichtlich der wurde abplakettiert aus plakettengr nden einfach abgeschafft

7207436 je ekliger die schei e ist desto eher tendiert die ganze angelegenheit zu braun ein bisschen subjektivit t ist dabei aber im gro en ganzen geht es gerecht zu keiner wird bervorteilt wir haben inzwischen eine relativ gesicherte erhebung da kann niemand sagen es sei alles an den zottigen haaren herbeigezogen wir h tten brigens nie gedacht dass es so viel ist also die gesamtmasse sozusagen alle tretminen hochgerechnet in kilo auf ein jahr
7207437 nur die mikro hunde liegen naturgem gut im rennen bei den dackeln und den k lbern sieht es dagegen ziemlich schei e aus
7207438 so wie die sich verh lt wird sie nicht bezahlen sie wird auch nicht wegziehen sie wird ihn aussetzen
7207439 senator biden was an excellent choice basically he needs to round out his foreign policy esperience but he also wanted to make a safe play
7207440 hes also very outspoken and i think hell be a great advocate for the democratic party
7207441 im hoping that john mccain will continue to keep the republicans in the white house and im hoping hell take mitt romney with him
7207442 we worked all night long all morning long as late as 6 30 in the morning where they injected high intense chlorine into the water lines at both schools

7207451 sesungguhnya kegagalan itu terasa menyakitkan semata karena anda tidak faham sesuatu dari allah di dalam kegagalan itu
7207452 siapa yang menyangka terlepasnya kelembutan ilahi atas takdirnya yang keras semata karena piciknya pandangan orang itu
7207453 jika allah membukakan pintu kefahaman maka kegagalan adalah hakikat pemberian
7207454 terkadang allah membukakan pintu taat allah bagimu dan tidak membukakan pintu suksesnya keinginnanmu bahkan allah pun menentukan suatu tindakan dosa padamu dan tindakan itu malah membuatmu sampai kehadirat nya
7207455 theyre just a gutsy team they just guts every game out and theyve been in some great form
7207456 so we knew they would come out strongly and we knew that if we played the way we wanted to play we could beat them
7207457 its handy to have those guys come back were looking pretty strong and weve just go to keep our heads down now and keep working
7207458 our midfields been pretty solid all year with joel corey and lingy and jimmy bartel and joel selwood theyre all pretty tough to match up on and hopefully we can keep the form going
7207459 in terms of a wrap up of the australian teams performance i think it can be summed up by saying that we optimised our opportunities and we optimised our performance
7207460 we finished sixth in the gold medal tally just behind germany and we finished fifth in the overall medal tally
7207461 it was written that we were going to have a showdown with the prime minister over funding there was none there will be none we are on the same page as the federal government
7207462 the real price of a gold medal would be three four or five times higher up to 100 million
7207463 in that regard its right up there with the very best

7207474 the end of life is death and the end of death is life
7207475 if we continue being a lawless society which is what we are doing we are well on our way to anarchy the point is that as admitted by johnny de lange the deputy minister of justice the system is not working
7207476 the second point is that if the law is broken then the authorities must act but we have so many cases in this country of selective law enforcement that the wheels have come off in general
7207477 by may 29 2006 11 suspects had already been arrested across gauteng and they were facing charges of murder attempted murder and assault with grievous bodily harm
7207478 in cases like these where many were killed mainly by being thrown off trains by their supposed colleagues its very difficult to make murder charges stick
7207479 the thing is where you have political involvement where the unions are involved there are not going to be charges brought
7207480 thats the way it is you can forget about it
7207481 it could be that it will be an internal matter

7207486 the curfew has been imposed to pre empt the rally
7207487 they are scared of our peaceful but massive demonstrations for freedom
7207488 such repressive measures will not work we will emerge stronger and more vibrant
7207489 if i had a story to tell it definitely would be the embrace and hug of georgian and russian athletes on the podium two days after there had been violent clashes in georgia
7207490 i think this kind of sportsmanship and fair play and brotherhood is remarkable
7207491 the regulations might not be perfect but they are a sea change compared to the situation before we hope that they will continue
7207492 the host government has not lived up to its olympic promise that the media will be completely free to report on all aspects of china
7207493 as we feared the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
7207494 we had a splendid village we had state of the art venues we had impeccable competition
7207495 we had a splendid village we had state of the art venues we had impeccable competition
7207496 this is pleasing because this is really a proof of the universality of the games
7207497 russian military you are not a liberating military you are an occupying force
7207498 there are very specific requirements for russian withdrawal putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the agreement we are in contact with the various parties to obtain clarification

7207547 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7207548 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time

7207559 whoever did this was just bold and seems to have spent some time at my business without worrying
7207560 so i would think they had to stop by one of the nearby gas stations for refueling
7207561 we had a special on our web site so we could move it quickly and i guess they really did move it
7207562 im hoping they find it but the chances are probably slim
7207563 i think overall weve certainly improved the transportation system in bibb county
7207564 every place we went we were going to have opposition to a project
7207565 all of a sudden all of our commissioners were taking heat on some project somewhere
7207566 it was like we were in too big a hurry to make a statement
7207567 water sewer and transportation infrastructure are all important in bringing business here

7207570 we just want to see a few things done properly here
7207571 now its easier to get from one side of town to the other
7207572 im happy with what we completed but i think theres still things that need to be done
7207573 this is not a ticket who will garner the support of the majority of american people
7207574 the obama campaign remains committed to georgia as evidenced by the 27 offices we have opened across the state as of today
7207575 the mccain campaign has yet to open their first there is enormous enthusiasm here for the obama biden ticket because georgians know they cant afford four more years of the failed bush policies that john mccain is offering
7207576 he will be a valuable running mate to sen obama

7207584 2046 bad choice cos the show almost make me fall asleep
7207585 thats the last thing you want to have happen in a preseason game it wasnt a very good sign
7207586 we lost two significant parts of what our offense hoped to be so not very good from that perspective
7207587 aw man those are frontline guys just to see those guys go down that takes the air out of the team
7207588 you get some injuries like this and now depth matters
7207589 if you dont have it you better go find out
7207590 not very happy with our backups as far as the effort and execution they played with
7207591 instead of focusing on one guy worrying about being in the box covering tight ends i can just read the quarterback and make plays
7207592 it just kind of reminded me of who we are
7207593 well theres the experience factor he seems capable though biden really shores up his weak spots its just that a lot of people want to be more comfortable with obama
7207594 what is it specifically that youre uncomfortable with his position on the bush tax cuts his timetable for withdrawal in iraq his potential supreme court nominees
7207595 unfortunately i think that i saw what i already knew
7207596 and thats if we just throw the ball around youre going to get penalties youre going to get your quarterback hit hes going to run around a lot and were going to be in trouble
7207597 you have to be a very disciplined person if youre going to leave it to the end of the day
7207598 it makes my day less stressful and i feel more motivated all day long
7207599 we were not sharp enough in the first half and our passing was certainly not as good as we expect it to be i dont know why
7207600 you have to give credit to fulham they played very well and they started sharper than us
7207601 we dominated the second half but i felt in the last 25 minutes we were too nervous and wanted to just hit the ball up there rather than create a chance
7207602 of course it is a setback but the result is there and we have to make up for it by winning the next match we have a big game on wednesday in the champions league and need to improve
7207603 we paid a big price for the mistake on their goal we should be able to cope with a corner when it comes in at low level like that
7207604 you are right that is a fact but we have to face it because from all our possession we could not produce many chances frankly the performance was just not good enough
7207605 i thought we played well for 70 minutes but perhaps in the last 15 or 20 we were guilty of trying too hard to just cling on to the lead and moved away from the style i can understand that perhaps we got tired because there was a lot of pressure but we have to be realistic and say it is the consistency to play well for 90 minutes that we need

7207609 it is regrettable that it was over so fast because i wanted to give china a really spirited bout but the most important thing is just that i got the gold medal
7207610 recently i have been eating pizza and hamburgers i enjoy western food pizza tastes pretty good
7207611 i can walk i can jog even but running like you run in a game like this i couldnt i didnt try to be a hero i just preferred for the guys that are healthy and in good condition to play
7207612 what theyve done today is one of the best performances ive seen im really proud winning the bronze is not the same as going home empty handed
7207613 in the morning he was very quiet and didnt say anything to anybody
7207614 only the doctor told me he would try his best to play he felt great pain so you know he was hurt if he couldnt play in this match
7207615 im going to san antonio now and after some tests well see
7207616 its the same ligament injury i suffered against the lakers ill be fine
7207617 we had a splendid village we had state of the art venues we have an impeccable operation and we had great performances
7207618 it is clear that has put the bar very high
7207619 there are issues london will not be able to equal
7207620 it is clear that the ability to bring in hundreds of thousands of volunteers in the different sites is something that number wise is not going to be easy for london
7207621 brought in the values of fair play and other values so i think that is the identity that has to be built around london london is also a very cosmopolitan city multiethnic multicultural multi religious so this is something you can also use as an asset
7207622 we are going to work on generating a party atmosphere
7207623 we have always urged china to give the widest possible access to the internet
7207624 we acknowledge that the situation has not been perfect but we acknowledge at the same time that the situation was a major change compared to before the games
7207625 you should not forget one thing it is not the ioc running the internet it is the chinese government running the internet
7207626 sometimes i forget that my world is not the mainstream
7207627 he is a lot more personal of a guy than morriss
7207628 he has a fire for the game that really rubs off on you he is very personal toward you and because of that you want to win he is a players coach
7207629 by playing that hard schedule you have the opportunity to send a message to the nation saying hey were back this is a new era of baylor football and were here to play
7207630 coach briles is high energy hes there in the middle of the huddle laughing with the guys calling plays overall its a huge personality change
7207631 its in our best interest to just you know keep to ourselves and do whatever is best for this team
7207632 until any of us have done anything in a game worthwhile to be talking about i think it is in our best interest to stick to ourselves and keep working to be to do whats best for our team
7207633 as reyering explained it to me kickoffs are like kicking a penalty kick
7207634 hes also said to us that youve got to make a lot of kicks in soccer when the other guys are running at you hes been able to relate that circumstance to field goals
7207635 everyone whos in position right now theyre ready to go
7207636 the way for us to build on our strengths and take advantage of our proven personnel is to be able to establish the run early in the season
7207637 weve got the two runners to do it so if we can open up some holes for them that would make it a lot easier for the management of the game for the quarterbacks
7207638 oh i had such a horrible childhood yada yada yada blah blah blah boo fuckin hoo

7207646 putting up permanent facilities and checkpoints are inconsistent with the ceasefire agreement
7207647 insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible
7207648 why do they want to take control of poti maybe they want to grab poti from us while we are still alive we will not allow them to stay here
7207649 its always at the back of your mind especially as someone who owns a business you wonder whether to keep building and reinvesting
7207650 but it just sits there behind you it doesnt stop you doing anything
7207651 as far as israeli law is concerned it is a part of israel like tel aviv or haifa so why are we even talking about considering giving it back
7207652 we are living here and we believe we will continue to live here and make wine here
7207653 its a tragedy there because there are two nations in one place
7207654 here it was different we never did something wrong to the arabs because when we came here it was empty
7207655 when we started we were pioneers we came here with the governments blessing
7207656 to continue your life here as a normal human being you must decide its business as usual otherwise you leave
7207657 well be angry well be against it but we wont shoot at the israeli army we are not gaza or hebron
7207658 we can live in a smaller israel the real problem is that arabs cant live with israelis they dont want to for them we are always strangers like the crusaders
7207659 about 70 percent say they are not willing to exchange the golan for a real peace treaty so we have good support
7207660 technical arrangements are important but not the heart of the matter water demilitarisation open access all these can be fixed in negotiations im speaking about our basic rights here after 40 years this should be on the table
7207661 some people say its ours its biblical its annexed others say the same holiness exists for peace i say find a middle way if not its not a necessity were here to stay
7207662 if there is real peace well welcome syrian riders to ramot ranch

7207670 das olympische dorf war gro artig die wettkampfst tten erstklassig die organisation makellos
7207671 wir k nnen keine ver nderungen in souver nen staaten erzwingen und alle krankheiten der welt heilen
7207672 die entscheidung war ohne zweifel richtig die ver nderungen dieser bemerkenswerten nation haben nicht mit olympia begonnen und sie werden auch nicht mit der schlussfeier enden die spiele waren eine inspiration f r die junge generation
7207673 if we all just came when the doors opened we wouldnt have to wait
7207674 i can do this i can do this i know i can do this
7207675 well only 15 mins and ill have done the full shift so i may as well carry on im so close
7207676 zu bewerten immerhin 73 was ich pers nlich sehr positiv und sch n finde
7207677 ziemlich fratzig nicht in der aussage aber in der art und weise und fratzigkeiten bin ich ein meinem kleinen l ndle lyrasien nun mal nicht gewohnt waren immerhin 10 der klicker was solls aber das ich da gegen fahren lassen musste ist ja wohl klar wie gr ne so e nich
7207678 klare aussagen gef llt nicht muss ja auch nicht jedem gefallen aber klare aussagen find ich gut
7207679 i can do this i can do this i know i can do this
7207680 well only 15 mins and ill have done the full shift so i may as well carry on im so close
7207681 we have this pattern now of finding temples close to the water or under the water in this most recent case
7207682 these were probably made as part of a very elaborate ritual
7207683 there are stones huge columns and sculptures of priests in the caves
7207684 caves are natural portals to other realms which could have inspired the mayan myth they are related to darkness to fright and to monsters
7207685 im sure the myths came first and the caves reaffirmed the broad time and space myths of the mayans
7207686 ok guys im going to let you sit out this game but i want you to practice
7207687 heck if im going to practice im going to play at least a series
7207688 hey batman ich hab unterhosen wo dein gesicht drauf ist
7207689 wahnsinn ist wie schwerkraft man braucht nichts weiter als einen kleinen schubs
7207690 if you asked me six months ago i would say it was sectarian
7207691 now i assure you its not they just feel better living in our big houses
7207692 two oclock by four id be back in my house and no one would say a word to me
7207693 in order to have a great friend you must first be one
7207694 faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
7207695 i was addicted to being skinny and looking absolutely perfect
7207696 whoever covers an offense seeks love but he who repeats a matter separates close friends
7207697 friends come and friends go but a true friend sticks by you like family
7207698 i have great friends who are always there for me and always know how to make me happy
7207699 my best friend is more than a best friend shes more like a sister
7207700 why do they have to keep advertising the switch to digital broadcasting february of 2009 in the past fifteen minutes ive seen ten freakin commercials for this crap all effing year ive had to watch these commercials we get it ok we get it i already have a dtv antenna couldnt you guys have just advertised about this in january how long does it take to purchase a stupid antenna for ten bucks at wal mart
7207701 we claim the privilege of worshiping almighty god according to the dictates of our own conscience and allow all men the same privilege let them worship how where or what they may
7207702 one who disbelieves or denies the existence of god or gods
7207703 no i do not believe in such thing as morality
7207704 i dont believe in god and i dont believe our actions carry any eternal consequences but morality is a good idea because it keeps society in order
7207705 and i am hopeful that the contractor foots the bill rather than the taxpayer
7207706 estamos dispuestos a negociar y pactar los presupuestos de ibarretxe
7207707 john mccain simply called to congratulate him and let his friend know he was thinking about him and his wife
7207708 i think that this is a time for unity in this country and maybe it is time to have a guy like john mccain a republican on the ticket with a guy he does like
7207709 one of the very big mistakes early on was that he didnt have enough troops on the ground particularly after the initial victory and thats still the case
7207710 theres not enough force on the ground to mount a real counterinsurgency
7207711 this is an emergency we were on a hike on lake melakwa and my kids were in a snow cave and it collapsed on them
7207712 oh so youre the americans weve all been waiting for
7207713 well yes vicky i do miss it as you know the mediterranean does not have any waves and my family has a home in ocean city new jersey where the atlantic ocean does have waves and i used to race my brother jack when we were young
7207714 new girl are we keeping her then i thought she was only here on temporary loan
7207715 depending on what she decides to do and im guessing shell decide to stay i was there for her introductory briefing remember i thought she was going to explode from pent up questions before we were through
7207716 while shes been very helpful in deciphering the texts we found on pz3 29q and she has a very strong expression of certain ancient linked genetic traits unmatched by anyone else weve found she doesnt seem very fond of the military in general and shes still in constant contact with her employer back in england i was under the impression she planned to return to them when she was done here
7207717 tealc just doesnt bother to mention new things or people over the phone unless he happens to find them relevant and i gotta say nothing against rosenberg but i never figured her for tealcs type
7207718 more along the lines of a certain subject she wasnt sure if she was allowed to ask or tell about while she was working here not the most awkward conversation ive ever had but it came pretty close
7207719 huh well that just makes the whole thing even weirder whats she doing hanging out with him so much then if shes not interested
7207720 she cant always be asking me questions she can only take so much of sam thinking up new ways to test how she manages to draw out and utilize zero point energy through a purely human interface and vala flusters her
7207721 yeah shes polite enough to his face but i think something about him bothers her
7207722 so convenience well that explains her but not tealc you see anything strange in his reactions to her shes not doing something to him with her abilities
7207723 tealc is perfectly capable of taking care of himself you know its not like the jaffa councils latest message to him was all that much of a surprise of course hed prefer to be more involved in the reconstruction now that the ori threat has been eliminated but hes made his allegiance to the tauri abundantly clear over the years he knew this was coming and hes fine with it hes not stoically depressed or vulnerable or whatever else is going through your mind
7207724 so sue me for worrying about a member of my team
7207725 seriously though its not just that ive heard a few things about rosenbergs background that arent for public consumption and this thing with tealc
7207726 well if you have a few more minutes to spare they meet up in one of the smaller gymnasiums this time of day when were on world for an hour or so of kelnoreem
7207727 apparently it helps her maintain control of her advanced abilities
7207728 and of course you know why tealc meditates i gather they thought it would be interesting to compare techniques
7207729 daarna marrit dr haar stijl gemaakt door jildau dat was iig de bedoeling na 3 plukken had ze al geen zin meer

7207733 third world areas such as this one are slowly but surely beginning to modernize as shown here by this female doctor
7207734 no i just want to win you dont understand i havent won anything i can sit up here all night
7207735 no i just want to win you dont understand i havent won anything i can sit up here all night
7207736 you want to make absolutely sure the assault didnt happen
7207737 this is the time somebody in that position really needs a lot support and help
7207738 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
7207739 they put the clampers on us held us down and we lost our confidence
7207740 we just werent able to handle the heat they put us under
7207741 we put it all on the floor every game and left nothing for anyone else
7207742 we played the best the whole tournament and are deserving of the gold medal
7207743 i was hoping to be up in the front and make a move at some point but i wasnt able to get to the front because of how quick it was the early pace
7207744 once you get to 25 30 kilometers and you dont see the lead vehicle anymore its hard to stay positive
7207745 i tried to hold it together as much as possible and everything was going exactly how i had planned until about 25 kilometers then i just started cramping
7207746 the difference is these guys run 2 06 in crazy conditions
7207747 we have our work cut out for us i need to work on some things if im going to be competitive with these guys
7207748 no no va hay que volver a dar marcha atr s
7207749 we have also called in the army to assist the police in enforcing law and order
7207750 the towers are completely down now and the demolition has been carried out as planned the site is now completely safe
7207751 one tower came down completely as expected and then there was about one third of the other one left standing but angled away from the viaduct as the demolition experts designed it to
7207752 people were looking at it saying are we supposed to be able to see it but the demolition crew went to the site and manipulated what remained so that it has now completely come down
7207753 weve lost dozens of experienced caregivers to other hospitals in the past few months alone
7207754 there are less people to train new staff vhs cant recover from bankruptcy if the board allows quorum to sacrifice its most important resource
7207755 but the vhs board isnt doing what they need to protect healthcare in our community
7207756 holding statement when asked specifically about the alleged incident at his home
7207757 theres been no settlement in relation to government teachers and no settlement in relation to teachers in catholic schools ms matthews said
7207758 what were claiming is an introduction of a pay rate that would recognise additional pay for outstanding or excellent teachers
7207759 i believe there are other intelligences out there and the closest is several galaxies away
7207760 will is the albert einstein of the gaming business no one else is pushing boundaries like he is
7207761 he is right up there with shigeru miyamoto in terms of his contributions to the gaming industry
7207762 he clearly didnt understand what makes those kinds of games work well so the sims online was a pretty serious failure

7207765 she only has to stand there and shell get at least an 8 without executing any dives
7207766 for two days after we got done crying after the race she didnt talk to me
7207767 to be able to have a second chance to be able to come together with these girls was great
7207768 we dont want to be a part of the team that doesnt win a gold medal thats whats on our mind and what was on the newcomers minds this time around
7207769 i dont think theres ever been a team as deep and thats why usa basketball is in good hands
7207770 no matter who was on the court there was no letdown at times when the subs were made the level of play went up
7207771 when lisa fouled out initially you think wow lisa just fouled out then you see sylvia running to check in and everything is ok
7207772 this is the most talented team with the least amount of preparation
7207773 all information is in chinese and the federation is making as thorough analysis as possible of the papers
7207774 this process may take some time but in due course the fig will make a full report of our findings to the international olympic committee
7207775 in the third set of images with phelps on the left it is clear he is really pushing hard while cavic on the right is just arriving
7207776 you cant just put your fingertips on the pad you really have to push it
7207777 ive been tested after every final session and a few preliminary sessions ive been doing tests since i got here and in singapore and at the training camp in palo alto calif
7207778 from the trials to now id say by a rough estimate theres been 40 tests thats a bunch but its part of the game and good for the sport to have it
7207779 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count we know were good we know were clean we work hard and anytime you want to test us its ok
7207780 i know for me i am clean i did project believe with usada u s anti doping agency where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts and i have the results to prove it
7207781 i want to be absolutely clear we cant guarantee their cleanliness
7207782 i want it to be as close to normal as possible
7207783 but i have no idea ill be able to answer that question when i get back to baltimore and see it firsthand i have no idea what its going to be like
7207784 my mom has told me that i better make the team because she wants to go to rome
7207785 i have the pressure from the mom so i guess we have to get back into it and make that happen
7207786 im going to live my life the way i always have
7207787 im going to do the things ive always done and hang out with the people ive always hung out with
7207788 he has been in here before several times with a big group of people
7207789 but id shy away from saying anything but congratulations people come in here to chill out you dont want to scare him away from the neighborhood
7207790 i think it will be different particularly for him as far as recognition or public adoration
7207791 and i think its going to be different than he thinks it will be it will be like whatever cal ripken goes through but it will be good for swimming
7207792 die stammw hlerschaft nimmt nicht mehr dieses abrufbare masse ein
7207793 stockholm was my first tournament and it was smaller than this
7207794 here its the tournament before the us open and its a really big tournament you know i have beaten some really great players on my way to winning this tournament
7207795 i just didnt have power especially in the third set
7207796 if you are not able to run and fight on the court then youre going to lose the match
7207797 not today but if i compare it to one month ago its much better so i look forward to playing the us open the most important tournament obviously is coming in two days i hope i will stay fresh for each match
7207798 i enjoy playing i enjoy playing for a big crowd you know when youre in the finals you dont have anything to lose you can just win
7207799 i was a little bit nervous in the beginning of the third set i got my rhythm back i was really pumped up when i had to be really enjoyed the moment in the end
7207800 unfortunately weve been operating in a system of crisis management and wed like to go to one of strategic planning
7207801 new jersey commission on rationalizing health care resources final report
7207802 theres a lot of meat left in the reinhardt commission report that hasnt been acted upon
7207803 its enough money to stay alive but not enough money to grow
7207804 it sounds like in my opinion were going to be limping along with this charity care problem and no health care reform for a number of years
7207805 its really not that difficult its just a matter of taking your time
7207806 its been my life dream to get my home off the road
7207807 to see something so large and heavy being moved so delicately is unbelievable these guys are like surgeons theyre amazing
7207808 ive told everyone theres one thing i want to do before i die
7207809 the fact that you have to look at your cell phone even for that one second is dangerous
7207810 you see people texting and walking all the time thats all people are doing
7207811 clearly if youre engaged in texting that requires concentration its very difficult to do another task especially walking in a big city
7207812 with time were knocking out our visual and audio cues that are grounding us in our environment
7207813 holding statement when asked specifically about the alleged incident at his home
7207814 police are investigating an alleged altercation at a premises in cronulla this morning which resulted in a woman sustaining an eye injury the statement said
7207815 you dont need to see his identification these arent the droids youre looking for he can go about his business move along

7207835 nunca en 35 a os de labor legislativa he visto a washington tan quebrado ni tantas decisiones importantes diferidas por pol ticos que eluden sus responsabilidades

7207848 i think its a combination of how our commodities versus rios commodities have developed
7207849 and i think its fair to say that investors are still waiting sitting on the sideline a little bit to see how we clear our regulatory pre conditions on this deal
7207850 its very hard to speculate on things that we dont think are going to happen and that are not the base line that we are planning around
7207851 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket
7207852 you never hear the specifics for his connections to tony rezko

7207856 that does tend to hide the fact that youve got immigrants from other countries equally concerned about this issue
7207857 some people say they would rather continue with their current status than accept the bill because what gives them faith that once they go back they will be able to come back to the united states
7207858 so many people are illegally crossing the border the u s government is being forced to come out with a general immigration policy that might be most effective for immigrants illegally crossing the border and might not be good for immigrants from other parts of the world
7207859 most people come here because they see this as a place of opportunity and by closing the door on that were perpetuating an elitist system
7207860 its important for all immigrants to realize there is power in voting and in participation
7207861 they have a voice and thats what other groups need
7207862 instead of sitting on the sidelines they need to let policymakers know others are here and need to be considered too
7207863 were working hard and paying taxes just like people who are from this country
7207864 we came here for a new life and to provide a future for our families
7207865 are not going to disappear so not solving the solution is the worst possible scenario for the country the state and them
7207866 just ignoring the problem is not going to solve anything
7207867 americans are served by a system that screens people identifies people and provides those people with protection of wage and hour laws protection of health and safety laws and brings them out of the shadows of the hypocrisy of a secondary economy
7207868 there are laws against hiring illegal aliens laws to protect our borders
7207869 what we need is attrition through enforcement we need to make it very clear to people that youre not going to benefit from remaining here illegally
7207870 when theres no direction from washington states and cities and towns that bear most of the costs of illegal immigration in the form of school expenses and criminal justice are going to conclude they have to do something on their own
7207871 cities and states are left holding the bag and at some point they have to decide to act
7207872 the federal government is at risk of ceding authority to state and local governments
7207873 well see more state and local ordinances more vigilante groups and more chaos they have to fill this vacuum
7207874 theyll still be in the shadows subject to deportations and raids
7207875 these people come here to work and feed their families
7207876 were saying on one side of our mouths that we want to stop undocumented immigration while on the other side were implicitly recognizing that without them entire industries would grind to a halt like agriculture hospitality construction seasonal jobs landscaping
7207877 all immigrants are thinking about is how to survive and about caring for their children
7207878 theyre not doing harm to this country theyre helping it
7207879 neither party really agrees within itself what the policy should be
7207880 what citizens have the hardest time understanding is that an issue like this involves lengthy and slow compromise
7207881 citizens might be more likely to contact their representative on this issue because the divisions here are not purely partisan
7207882 its the hot topic right now because people know immigration is hitting the floor of the senate and this is their time to be heard
7207883 whats the cost of those who live here illegally and drive without auto insurance or who rely on taxpayers to cover medical care schools and welfare services for their families
7207884 i am a witness to a myriad of success stories of immigrants and it saddens me that none of them are made public
7207885 my family and close friends are successful and well educated immigrants they are pediatricians family therapists lawyers social workers emergency room doctors psychologists restaurant owners professors
7207886 citizenship is a very important gift i have no problem offering it to everyone else we have a big country with a lot of big opportunities for everyone else too
7207887 our legislators are surrendering to pressure groups demanding citizenship for people who have repeatedly violated our laws
7207888 the stakes are very high here for both democrats and republicans
7207889 everyone wants to have a deal and if they fail its a failure of leadership all around the american public wants a solution
7207890 esto ha sido algo muy duro que no se lo deseo a nadie hace meses viv a con mi familia en miami garden y ahora estoy aqu sin trabajo y mi esposa con mis hijos all sin que nadie los apoye
7207891 la gente es muy pobre aqu y hace mucho calor

7207898 luego busqu los servicios de un abogado de origen nicarag ense que s lo me perjudic siempre que nos tocaba ir a la corte no me defend a se quedaba medio callado
7207899 el mayor error fue que en el af n de buscar evidencias de mi estad a yo le proporcion al abogado una carta que estaba escrita en ingl s con fecha de 1996 como en ese momento yo no sab a hablar ingl s s lo me fij en la fecha y l tampoco la ley y s lo la incorpor a mi expediente esa carta la hab a hecho otro abogado de apellido lincoln donde solicitaba visa para mi ingreso a ee uu en ese a o

7207901 spouses and children of american citizens should be with their family
7207902 in any other aspect of law we dont allow parents to use children as human shields
7207903 anytime you punish parents for breaking the law it inevitably winds up affecting the children but we dont say were not going to punish you because it harms your innocent child
7207904 there is a reason that the preamble to the universal declaration of human rights highlights the unity of the family as the foundation of freedom justice and peace in the world
7207905 our families make us whole our families make the nation strong
7207906 families are impacted by decisions family members make every day
7207907 the consequences for violating the nations immigration laws are well known and nobody here illegally should be surprised if they are detained and placed in removal proceedings
7207908 we thought it would be better if we stuck together and showed that we are a real family and we stand by each other and want to face this together

7207920 my concern is it wont be generous enough and people wont legalize
7207921 we have a great stake in the integration of these populations and its an illusion to think theyre going to disappear
7207922 we need to make sure these kids have legal parents with membership in society and we arent creating an underclass
7207923 before when i didnt have papers i was always worried they would send me back to mexico
7207924 whenever there were rumors immigration was coming wed have to hide go sleep in a car or in the field so they couldnt find us
7207925 the more hoops there are to jump through the more disincentive there is to legalize
7207926 i understand the fear that legalization will backfire and five years down the line were back to where we began

7207942 maybe well have the audience take off their clothes too and there will be absolutely no flash photography allowed
7207943 when we did the show in the spring of 2006 we chickened out and did it in very small towels

7207954 its been quite candidly pretty tough some of the time for me in my new job
7207955 but seriously cbs and couric should be pleased who wouldnt take an audience gain of 28 400 viewers these days and feel good about it
7207956 to see us gaining and making strides in some of these major markets is wonderful news
7207957 ive always felt proud of the broadcast even in the early days when it was so criticized for certain elements im one of these people who thinks its ok to take chances and to try things i always thought even the things that werent well received were noble efforts in trying to evolve the broadcast so the fact that were doing well is very gratifying
7207958 i think one of the most exciting aspects of my coming to this job was the chance to spread my wings on the internet
7207959 i think anybody who hasnt been living under a rock for the last 10 years understands how news consumption is changing dramatically and how the internet is playing an increasingly important role im a naturally interactive person in terms of my personal style and were trying to reach out to folks
7207960 on the internet its a much different sensibility they want it a little more raw less filtered less varnished and i think that plays to my strengths its sort of more of a today show sensibility in terms of being relaxed or being able to make a mistake or laugh at yourself or ask an off the wall question i always thought that hopefully i could be a successful bridge between traditional media and the internet just in terms of the way i communicate in a more casual way
7207961 even given the gains in cities like baltimore the question is can they build on them and improve the national ratings
7207962 they have to do that first and it takes time the question then becomes how long couric and cbs are willing to stick with it
7207963 i think she has been caught up in the desperate efforts of tv news to try to retain audience through an ill considered meshing of solid journalism and mush that has no true constituency i think couric is knowledgeable about the world and if she were allowed to do a harder edged newscast she might fare better
7207964 i have no plans to leave i want to do the best job i possibly can for cbs news i care about our newscast and my colleagues and i have no plans to split
7207965 a lot of people like to write about well shell leave here or shell leave there but thats never been an issue here
7207966 our managements been completely behind her and the correspondents and the producers are completely behind her and she has worked her tail off
7207967 how many of the prophets fought in allahs way and with them fought large bands of godly men but they never lost heart if they met with disaster in allahs way nor did they weaken in will nor give in and allah loves those who are firm and steadfast
7207968 whenever allah wills good for a person he subjects him to adversity
7207969 and remember that abraham was tried by his lord with certain commands which he fulfilled he said
7207970 but my promise is not within the reach of evil doers
7207971 we know indeed the grief which their words do cause thee it is not thee they reject it is the signs of allah which the wicked condemn rejected were the apostles before thee with patience and constancy they bore their rejection and their wrongs until our aid did reach them there is none that can alter the words and decrees of allah already hast thou received some account of those apostles if their spurning is hard on thy mind yet if thou were able to seek a tunnel in the ground or a ladder to the skies and bring them a sign what good if it were allahs will he could gather them together unto true guidance so be not thou amongst those who are swayed by ignorance and impatience
7207972 before thee we sent apostles to many nations and we afflicted the nations with suffering and adversity that they might learn humility
7207973 whenever we sent a prophet to a town we took up its people in suffering and adversity in order that they might learn humility
7207974 allah will not leave the believers in the state in which ye are now until he separates what is evil from what is good nor will he disclose to you the secrets of the unseen but he chooses of his messenger for the purpose whom he pleases so believe in allah and his apostles and if ye believe and do right ye have a reward without measure
7207975 or do ye think that ye shall enter the garden of bliss without such trials as came to those who passed away before you they encountered suffering and adversity and were so shaken in spirit that even the messenger and those of faith who were with him cried
7207976 or think ye that ye shall be abandoned as though allah did not know those among you who strive with might and main and take none for friends and protectors except allah his messenger and the community of believers but allah is well acquainted with all that ye do
7207977 do men think that they will be left alone on saying
7207978 hast thou not turned thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands from fight but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity
7207979 our lord why hast thou ordered us to fight wouldst thou not grant us respite to our natural term near enough
7207980 short is the enjoyment of this world the hereafter is the best for those who do right never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least
7207981 and their lord hath accepted of them and answered them
7207982 the believing man or woman continues to have affliction in person property and children so that they may finally meet allah free from sin
7207983 no calamity befalls a muslim but that allah expiates some of his sins because of it even though it were the prick he receives from a thorn
7207984 the prophets then those who come next to them then those who come next to them a man is afflicted in keeping his religion if he is firm in his religion his trial is severe but if there is weakness in his religion it is made light for him and it continues like that till he walks on the earth having no sin
7207985 verily the greatness of reward is proportionate to the greatness of the test and indeed if allah loves a people he tests them whoever is pleased upon him is allahs pleasure and whoever is angry upon him is allahs wrath
7207986 if allah wants to do good to somebody he afflicts him with trials

7207995 in this space i tend to spotlight hip hop producers from the past 10 years that could be considered both overrated and underrated guys that maybe had a couple hits but are far from household names or even considered cool in an underground way the st louis duo the trackboyz really epitomize that kind of uncomfortable middle ground and id really planned to do one of my first posts in this series about them back a couple years ago when i first started it when they still had a little bit of buzz now that im finally getting around to it though its been years since their last major label placement and it feels like the trackboyz moment of relevance is ancient history already which in a way is a more interesting vantage point from which to go back and look at what i liked so much about their beats to begin with

7208002 the policies meet monthly mortgage costs should an accident sickness or unemployment occur and the unemployment criterion is generally interpreted as being made unemployed by your employer however those opting to leave their job because of circumstances beyond their control ie caring are also covered
7208003 over two million people start caring every year and i fear a number of them may have mppi but do not realise they can claim on their policy as a result theyre missing out and suffering financial hardship
7208004 whilst this isnt a long term solution it does provide a temporary mortgage repayment financial safety net in that first year and will help people keep their homes and give them time to sort out their finances

7208088 to not hang on to the things of this world for life as we know it is passing away be it people or things
7208089 let us count it all joy whatever trials we may face let us rejoice in the lord
7208090 i pray that your love will overflow more and more and that you will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding
7208091 love is like a flower at first its beautiful then it just whithers and dies
7208092 ive heard the rumours but they dont bother me in the slightest its a load of absolute nonsense a lot of it is down to jealousy
7208093 if you take all the airports in ireland all the little ones and the big ones is one of the only airports in ireland that we believe no drug has ever come through
7208094 we have staff in weston who have worked there since even before we bought it and like the guards on the beat on the street who know everything thats happening these people are there all the time and they know all the different people coming in and out and i would say that not one drug has ever come through
7208095 the people who are spreading these rumours are definitely liars in my opinion because they have no such proof and if they have then the police should know about it or we should know about it
7208096 i would love to get someone who could tell me directly some policeman or someone else about who is spreading these rumours about me and drugs not for money or anything but id love to take them out and i would bring them to court because theres no drugs in my business
7208097 there was so much inaccurate and misleading information at the time stories were printed that the drugs were found on the plane but no such thing ever happened the drugs were seized before they even entered the airport in belgium
7208098 there was even a story that my plane had been locked up along with the pilots at a time when it was actually in ireland and indeed was being flown around
7208099 people have claimed that there is no customs or security nothing could be further from the truth weston is one of the most secure airports in the country we have state of the art facilities better than many airports in ireland and even europe
7208100 at great expense we voluntarily installed x ray machines for baggage and people going through the airport and these machines can even detect drugs
7208101 there is also a dedicated office for customs at weston and we have an excellent working relationship with both customs and the gardai
7208102 and anyone that says that i can say straight out to them that they are absolute liars
7208103 katy frenchs death had absolutely nothing to do with me or my family i felt very sorry for her and for the family she seemed a very nice person but other than that it didnt affect me at all
7208104 i would have met katy three times in my life i thought she was a very nice girl and that her death was very sad i suppose all those types of people take some sort of drugs which is terrible really and jimmy my middle lad would have known her well but not that well
7208105 he would have known her for two or three months through andrea roche jim mansfields daughter in law because she would have held the beauty contests here in citywest
7208106 i heard rumours that it linked back to jim junior a few people said this that and the other about jimmy and the drugs but maybe it was lucky he was away that week he was in
7208107 ive heard people say he was with her that night and all this sort of thing but i happen to know he wasnt with her that night because he was away in spain
7208108 none of my sons have ever ever taken drugs i can sit here and honestly say that i would never have had to talk to any of them about drugs in my life because they are simply not that way inclined theyre always too busy doing something else
7208109 im improving now hopefully ill live another while i keep looking forward i seldom ever look back i like what i do and i like to be able to do it ive no great interest in going for holidays in the sun
7208110 i start now at 6 30am every morning and finish up early at 11pm each night but i did have a holiday there a few weeks ago i went off on a friday evening and i came back on a sunday
7208111 i love looking at antiques and going to auctions and getting things done up
7208112 i have a collection of antique aircraft which includes american president eisenhowers
7208113 i want to let all the people see and believe that what i decided to do when i first went into weston and my plans to make it a model airport have been done we have succeeded to a great extent so far and what were doing now will help that greatly
7208114 its probably a form of madness for me to be able to improve a property is a big thing
7208115 when i see all the people around who have lovely properties just lying there and dont bother about it i do wonder if i am mad
7208116 its unbelievable that there are so many beautiful properties around ireland just lying there down around
7208117 i dont feel i ever get stressed about things the doctors are telling me i should be doing this and that and i shouldnt be here at the office but stress to me is when a doctor tells me i have to stay at home i cant ever see myself stopping work as long as im able to do it i will do it
7208118 it feels like when i was a young lad going to school if you got a half a crown you felt great and the few quid youd have would still feel like that to be able to have it is a good thing
7208119 if money gets you to the stage where you forget about the people who are important to you and your friends from school youre then lost
7208120 i have money in property and in this and that but at the end of the day it means nothing to me really its no motivation at all to me i get satisfaction from what i do and it all coming right
7208121 money wouldnt come on my list of priorities at all all i want is to be able to get a bit of money to eat every week and thatll keep me going the family is my top priority i love to have them all together and were all very close
7208122 i certainly want a new heart and i cant get it something to keep me going a bit longer
7208123 theres nothing that i have ever done that would ever keep me awake at night
7208124 when i look back at everything i dont think i really have any regrets i couldnt find much fault with anything ive done
7208125 the tragedy of life is not so much what men suffer but rather what they miss
7208126 to make or become more typical or characteristic of america especially in terms of culture customs language etc
7208127 the gunman tripped as he chased after mitchell and that saved his life his weapon went off as he was falling to the ground and the bullets went off in different directions mitchell was running towards the back of the bar to try and find some cover and got hit in the shoulder the other two victims just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time it all happened so quickly the gunman was up and out of the bar before anyone could react properly
7208128 peters not around hes gone out for a jog but he wouldnt speak anyway we dont speak to journalists
7208129 it was like the wild west the people fighting were throwing anything they could get their hands on at each other chairs and bottles were flying
7208130 it was absolute pandemonium some people ran for cover as it all kicked off and others just dropped to the ground and covered their heads
7208131 the minute they realised someone had been shot there was a mass surge for the door as people tried to get out of the club as quickly as they could
7208132 i dont need any more awards i know who i am
7208133 indie girl who was a loser in high school but is now cool enough to wear a dress with converse
7208134 loose or more frequent stools an urgent need to go to the bathroom or gas with an oily discharge
7208135 the excess fat that passes out of your body isnt harmful but you should be prepared for the possibility of it happening
7208136 she doesnt have the excuse of being a poor girl if you are a party person and you like to have fun and drink a little you better take a driver
7208137 you have the feeling here that some of them survived serious car crashes
7208138 i dont think those operations are very pleasant perhaps i should try one but i dont think i will i am too scared the idea that you cannot move your face must be horrible men do it here too they should only come out at night but then they wouldnt get tanned
7208139 when possible we have identified the bodies by fingerprints we have been able to identify 53 bodies through fingerprints and practically all the bodies have been given to their relatives
7208140 right now they have just identified a child before then there were only two cases of positive identification using dna we are very worried that we could be here waiting for even a month
7208141 fighting is still going on we hit and destroyed over 40 militants bunkers and a training camp
7208142 we have confirmed reports that 50 militants were killed while 10 of our soldiers were martyred
7208143 we cant even flee theres curfew on the one hand and on the other hand militants use us as human shield when they are attacked what we can do
7208144 we have found a letter from the spot which indicates that it may be a maoists attack
7208145 there are instances where the rebels have threatened hindu temples here
7208146 ele jos s crates at anda a copiar o que eu j fa o h muitos anos at j anda a oferecer computadores e a levar os velhinhos a passear pelo pa s
7208147 the fire was so intense theres not a lot of it left
7208148 it is with disbelief that we struggle to comprehend the events of yesterday
7208149 provided much needed dermatology care to patients who might otherwise go without
7208150 we are just deeply saddened these are individuals that were highly skilled and very professional in what they do and they will be missed
7208151 he was very well qualified hed flown that plane for hundreds of hours hed flown this route many times
7208152 its just weird i mean something happened to make this guy veer left off the runway

7208154 socially responsible investing somewhat lies in the eyes of the beholder
7208155 natural gas is far more efficient and environmentally friendly than fuels like coal so where we can we take the more environmentally friendly fuel
7208156 may make funds take a look at their largest prospectuses and make sure they are following
7208157 the difference comes down to success if a new idea
7208158 there is a compelling marketing rationale so you can understand why a fund company wants to do this but from an investors perspective based on the real results seen so far there is no compelling reason to choose 130 30s over other approaches
7208159 they are trying to present this as a safer way of investing as a way to make money or lose less in all market conditions but the results just havent shown that
7208160 theyre designed to help people who dont want to annuitize to come up with some type of financial structure to spend their money
7208161 some are considerably over 1 percent which i would consider expensive
7208162 i would treat them like a regular mutual fund and get more suspicious the further they go over 1 percent
7208163 if you believe you cant flood thats when you increase the risk of flooding in new orleans i dont think they talk about the risk
7208164 theyve heightened the levees theyre raised up it makes me feel safe
7208165 this wall here wasnt there when we had the flood
7208166 when i look at it now i say maybe if we had had it up it there then maybe we wouldnt have flooded
7208167 i am not diana the film is not about diana

7208171 what the liberals are doing is targeting a handful of specific things in our savings package in order to play politics
7208172 they are playing with fire because if they punch holes in the budget surplus the end result is that it is harder for the rba to reduce interest rates
7208173 the key people in the frame here are the liberal party
7208174 dr nelson is fond of describing himself and the liberal party as the alternative government its about time they started acting like an alternative government
7208175 there are a number of small and important measures to which we are opposed and as a matter of principle we will oppose them
7208176 none of those tax increases 20 billion of tax increases in the budget were foreshadowed by the government prior to the election
7208177 if youre fighting inflation the last thing you do is increase taxes on alcohol cars software and other functions of business

7208179 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7208180 ce que nous avons accompli durant ces jeux constitue une formidable dynamique pour le futur
7208181 il est clair que la chine a plac la barre tr s haut

7208186 i feel like everything has been left out there in the last three years since ive taken this team over there have been a lot of questions could this team pull it together could i pull it together so for me its tremendous satisfaction not just to win a gold medal but to really win it with an exclamation point
7208187 she brings a calm to chaotic situations she helps stabilize things because shes so consistent
7208188 not only do we have more computers but the educational software is expanding and improving every day
7208189 technology is a research tool a communication tool but now more than ever it is an instructional tool
7208190 technology is a tool to enhance the curriculum and instruction
7208191 we see it as a way for teachers to deliver instruction as well as for students to be engaged with the instruction
7208192 technology is definitely a part of the 21st century and in order to prepare students for the future we need to give them the tools and put the tools in their hands to be ready to go forward and also for the teachers to be able to deliver the information in a way thats enticing for students who grow up with ipods and wiis
7208193 our overall goal is for all teachers to have equal access to cutting edge technology for the benefit for their students
7208194 in order to help equalize schools that dont have ptas that can raise more money almost all of those schools are title i
7208195 in terms of technology resources i dont believe that any student is disadvantaged
7208196 ive been in a lot of college courses where that kind of technology was used and i always thought they were great
7208197 i just thought they were really more compelling than sitting and watching a chalkboard
7208198 i think theres a place for both and thats why were putting these out there as well
7208199 they cant wait to get them in their classrooms and its just from the standpoint of being able to engage the students and being able to easily work this into a lesson that addresses so many different learning styles
7208200 we serve as a model of how teachers can collaborate with media and technology coordinators to integrate media and technology resources into daily instruction
7208201 the purpose of all of this is to facilitate 21st century learning and to prepare our students for a technology rich future
7208202 i think theyre really cool and i think theyre good for schools
7208203 theyre neat i just think its cool like instead of a like a dry erase board its something you can actually write on but its connected to the computer
7208204 weve had riot police asking to use our bathroom all day

7208208 the doctor said maybe i slept on my eye and i do sleep
7208209 i thought maybe if i got some blood flowing to my brain for once it would help but it didnt happen my first at bat i couldnt see the pitchers face was all blurry and it was even worse in the outfield numbers were blurry i used every eye drop in the clubhouse but it didnt work
7208210 he was throwing strikes thats encouraging to see from a guy that young
7208211 that was a good idea its a good way to get people out they say it makes it a little easier to throw some sliders in the dirt and let them swing at them it was just an all around good day
7208212 i simplified my delivery so much it feels the same between the stretch and the windup
7208213 before there was a big difference i was almost confusing myself between the stretch and the windup
7208214 i was happy to see frank get a few hits
7208215 we have a good team we showed that the first half
7208216 were going to face a good pitcher and well go out with a good game plan and try to beat him
7208217 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7208218 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety
7208219 looks like a cleanup on aisle 4 achievement that is unlocked by stepping in pile of poop awesome indeed
7208220 i remember how quiet you were little did we know and being really worried you didnt have a good time and wouldnt come
7208221 the two presidents have agreed on the need to set up an international mechanism under the osce aegis to replace russian patrols in the security zone in the south from south ossetia
7208222 there was no discussion of an issue related with the replacement of the russian peacekeeping forces with monitors from osce
7208223 during the conversation with nikola sarkozy dmitry medvedev reaffirmed russias readiness to cooperate with osce in this zone in accordance to the fifth principles of the six point ceasefire accord developed jointly by the french and russian presidents
7208224 president sarkozy insisted it was important that russian troops present at the poti senaki area should withdraw as soon as possible

7208234 now its suddenly become the destination where everybody wants to be at the end of the day to see the sunset and to see the views which are spectacular
7208235 theyre eroding very rapidly the magnificent sculpture on the shrine at the center of the temple is in very fragile condition and has not been treated for conservation yet
7208236 people shouldnt really be touching it or going anywhere near it
7208237 there is a whole combination of factors that are putting a tremendous amount of pressure on the poor
7208238 we havent had an economic shock of this magnitude in years

7208247 because i know i took care of them they had a good life
7208248 my parents have always said they would be a little upset if we didnt feel something when we get rid of them
7208249 and it is sad its hard to part with them but its part of a balanced diet and you know going into the market projects that this is what theyre destined for
7208250 4 h gets their feet on the ground so they can pretty much handle any curveball thrown at them
7208251 we store them very very carefully in the hopes that someone someday may decide that we can use them again
7208252 youd have to talk to every one of the 10 072 election jurisdictions across the country
7208253 after 2000 everyone thought you could throw a bunch of money at the problem and make it go away right away elections aint that kind of thing
7208254 there has been no evidence of any tampering on these machines
7208255 war is delightful to those who have had no experience of it
7208256 successful art tears away the veil and allows you to see the world with lapidary clarity successful art pulls you apart and puts you back together again often against your will and in the process reminds you in a visceral way of your limitations your vulnerabilities makes you in effect more human
7208257 from a border state and comes every day through maryland
7208258 i have always seen joe as just your regular guy the same kind of guy who i met during the summer when i worked at
7208259 has exhibited tremendous judgment on foreign policy issues but i think joe biden with his long track record of experience in that area will further strengthen those credentials
7208260 i think obama was desperate for some foreign policy heft
7208261 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7208262 this is showing obama is a bigger person and can get beyond that
7208263 its almost like hes the third senator in pennsylvania which is a swing state
7208264 also he is roman catholic and that is a critical bloc of voters in a national election
7208265 i think his eloquence and his quick wit enable him to be a very effective counterpuncher to the anonymous 527s and the mudslinging that john mccain is going to encourage his allies to engage in
7208266 he brings something to the ticket that people want to see
7208267 i think the party need not run away from the idea that biden counters the message of change
7208268 i think the attraction is the unique combination of scenery the white bluffs and the wildlife and that odd collection of nuclear sites
7208269 i would like to see the b reactor preserved because i would like that story to be told
7208270 dont neglect this part of the fish department if youre on a budget
7208271 the question consumers are asking is who is going to give me a way to moderate my food costs
7208272 i think were going to see a whole bunch of promotions that we havent seen before
7208273 fuel your family for less than the price of a gallon of gas
7208274 with the situation with the economy were looking at doing additional promotions and showing consumers how to shop us cheaper
7208275 like every other retailer out there were fighting the same battle they are in terms of what we can offer our customers in these times
7208276 we want them to know that they can shop here and not break the bank
7208277 sometimes all we have is the food that he sends until i get paid for my job and i can buy the things that i need
7208278 the way things are going thank god i have him
7208279 national conventions are almost always held in uncomfortable and filthy places
7208280 food is bad and expensive and everyone goes home exhausted and sore
7208281 there is something about a national convention that makes it as fascinating as a revival or a hanging
7208282 it is vulgar it is ugly it is stupid it is tedious it is hard upon both the higher cerebral centers and the gluteus maximus and yet it is somehow charming one sits through long sessions wishing all the delegates and alternates were dead and in hell and then suddenly there comes a show so gaudy and hilarious so melodramatic and obscene so unimaginably exhilarating and preposterous that one lives a gorgeous year in an hour
7208283 the party that wins the battle of the conventions will likely win the election
7208284 which is good because people dont really think about delaware its like dela where
7208285 but im still not sure on obama i dont really know about him
7208286 i just think hes a sincere and down to earth guy
7208287 the only negative about him really is he speaks sometimes before he thinks of the consequences
7208288 the way well be the zogby report on the transformation of the american dream
7208289 four meta movements that separately and together are redefining the american dream living with limits embracing diversity looking inward and demanding authenticity
7208290 great transition my polling has limned and confirmed time and again going from a nation of excess to one of tangible limits on spending on the exercise of power even on our hopes and imaginings
7208291 collectively we americans might not know exactly what authentic is but for the most part we know what it is not and we know that we want whatever authentic might be
7208292 a continuing five day battle in the streets and parks of chicago
7208293 yeah but back when you were a drug addict you hit their mother
7208294 im going to write some book and somebodys going to buy it from me and were going to use the advance to fund college

7208296 like some exotic dish that i dont yet know how to make but yearn for in my dreams
7208297 loneliness nearly as acute as his own they both longed to return to a time before the people they loved most were lost

7208302 why didnt we do something 10 years ago five years ago three years ago one year ago beats the heck out of me
7208303 its the most obvious thing that we would invest a small amount of money to get our kids not just the hardware but all the software all the visual curriculum and all the teacher development
7208304 people think were much more connected in terms of the internet highway than we are
7208305 my resources are there for lesson planning for sharing ideas and getting amazing curriculum
7208306 theyre not dazzled by doing this its just natural to them they do amazing things

7208312 who are committed to the desirability of fostering both a belief in god and a recognition of the merits of our economic system
7208313 this was no populism of pitchfork carrying farmers it was a populism of wealthy men telling those trained into scholarship purported experts but really little more than moral functionaries how to run the ship an anti intellectualism on the march for the upper classes
7208314 the cold war provided a way of seeing the world in apocalyptic terms
7208315 i would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice and let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue
7208316 the principal advantage is persistence that you would be there all the time
7208317 a satellite goes over the same part of the earth twice a day and one of those is at night so its only really getting a snapshot of activity zephyr would be watching all day
7208318 we think zephyr is very close to an operational system within the next two years is what were aiming for
7208319 we have one more step of improvements we trying to design a robust and reliable system that will really sit up there for months and we want to push the performance
7208320 a lot of effort has gone into power storage and light weighting the systems
7208321 lithium sulphur is more than double the energy density of the best alternative technology which is lithium polymer batteries

7208325 were going back to some old school season one storytelling with the book
7208326 just as michaels tattoos in the first year the book has this seasons mysteries in it riddles clues puzzles our guys will need to get a hold of that book in order to complete their tasks for season four
7208327 its hard to discount the smooth beauty of the dp1s output thanks to both the well designed sigma lens and the refined output of the foveon x3 sensor but the slow autofocus difficult interface and slow post processing required to achieve that excellence is hard to ignore
7208328 photos at iso 100 200 are just fine at iso 400 it gets more grainy and also the photo pro software desaturates the images result of color noise removal we guess iso 800 may still produce nice b amp w images
7208329 the raw image quality of the sigma dp1 is excellent truly far and away superior to that of any digicam that i have yet seen or used given that the camera uses an almost aps c sized sensor this should not be all that surprising
7208330 how does sigma stuff 14 megapixels into its light compact dp1 digital compact by using the same foveon sensor it put into its new sd14 dslr foveons chip stacks three imaging sites red green blue at each pixel which allows sigma to multiply out the 2652 1768 sensor layout to arrive at 14 active megapixels however due to that design the camera will probably deliver closer to 9mp effective resolution

7208335 al final de toda esta historia la dignidad se haga costumbre en nuestro pa s y en nuestra tierra latinoamericana
7208336 que sufre d a a d a este mismo problema a todos los marginados de este pa s a todos aquellos que han sido reprimidos y han tenido que emigrar incluso
7208337 parece absurdo que el gobierno pida que levantemos la huelga para dialogar con nosotros los presidentes de las comunidades han dicho que seguir n y as ser lo que pasa es que el estado no quiere entender que estamos reclamando nuestros derechos vulnerados por mucho tiempo
7208338 no necesitamos una comisi n mediadora sino un proceso de coordinaci n para hacer efectivo este acercamiento y que los puntos planteados en la plataforma de lucha sean escuchados
7208339 detr s de los pueblos ind genas no hay nadie
7208340 en representaci n de 200 000 ind genas organizados en 35 federaciones de comunidades nativas nosotros hemos respaldado la acci n de inconstitucionalidad contra los decretos 1015 1073 1064 y 1089 presentada por la defensora del pueblo
7208341 nuestra propuesta plantea la definici n de una pol tica sobre pueblos ind genas el fortalecimiento de la institucionalidad la creaci n de un marco jur dico que proteja a nuestros pueblos y la elaboraci n de un plan de desarrollo sostenible
7208342 no apoya ni promueve ninguna movilizaci n bajo el t rmino de pacifica
7208343 aspiramos a un mundo respetuoso de los derechos humanos en particular aspiramos a que los pueblos y las comunidades locales puedan definir su propio destino en un marco de diversidad solidaridad y reciprocidad
7208344 contribuir a las transformaciones sociales culturales e institucionales de chile y la regi n mediante la promoci n de una ciudadan a activa e intercultural de modo de permitir que los pueblos las comunidades locales y las personas ejerzan sus derechos humanos en un contexto de diversidad reciprocidad y respeto
7208345 most of your calls are nights and weekends lower your day time calling
7208346 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
7208347 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
7208348 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
7208349 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
7208350 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
7208351 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
7208352 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
7208353 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
7208354 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
7208355 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
7208356 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
7208357 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
7208358 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
7208359 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
7208360 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
7208361 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
7208362 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
7208363 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
7208364 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
7208365 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
7208366 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7208367 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7208368 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7208369 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7208370 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7208371 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7208372 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7208373 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7208374 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7208375 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7208376 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7208377 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7208378 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7208379 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7208380 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7208381 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7208382 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7208383 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7208384 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7208385 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7208386 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7208387 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s
7208388 ellos paran la movilizaci n y nosotros reiniciamos el di logo
7208389 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo
7208390 i dont know how i should be feeling in this sudden mess of me know the song en espa ol
7208391 i have like a few of their songs especially this one song
7208392 haha im not a big fan of them i just like some of their songs i never said i was big fan
7208393 hef uw linkervuist om de imperialisten neer te slaan en uw rechter om de communisten neer te slaan
7208394 de gehele natuur zegt engels bevindt zich vanaf het kleinste tot aan het grootste van de zandkorrels tot aan de zonnen van de protisten oorspronkelijk levende cel red tot aan de mens in een eeuwig ontstaan en vergaan in een onafgebroken vloeien in rusteloze beweging en verandering
7208395 de dingen en hun afbeeldingen in de begrippen in wezen in hun verband hun aaneenschakeling hun beweging hun ontstaan en vergaan
7208396 is de proef op de dialectiek en wij moeten erkennen dat de moderne natuurwetenschap voor deze proef een uiterst rijk dagelijks toenemend materiaal heeft geleverd en daarmede heeft bewezen dat het in de natuur in laatste instantie dialectisch en niet metafysisch toegaat dat zij zich niet eeuwig in dezelfde kring voortbeweegt maar een werkelijke geschiedenis doormaakt hier moet voor alles darwin genoemd worden die aan de metafysische natuurbeschouwing een geweldige schok heeft toegebracht door zijn ontdekking dat de gehele tegenwoordige organische natuur planten en dieren en daarmede ook de mens het product is van een gedurende miljoenen jaren voortgezet ontwikkelingsproces
7208397 in de fysica is iedere verandering een omslag van de kwantiteit in de kwaliteit het gevolg van de kwantitatieve verandering van de in het lichaam voorhanden of daaraan toegevoerde hoeveelheid beweging in de een of andere vorm zo heeft b v de temperatuur van het water de eerste tijd geen invloed op de vloeibaarheid daarvan maar bij de verhoging of verlaging van de temperatuur van het vloeibare water breekt er een moment aan dat deze cohesietoestand zich wijzigt en het water in het ene geval in damp en in het andere geval in ijs verandert zo is er een bepaalde minimumstroomsterkte voor nodig om de platinadraad van de elektrische gloeilamp te doen gloeien zo heeft ieder metaal zijn eigen gloei en smeltpunt zo heeft iedere vloeistof haar eigen bij een gegeven druk vaststaand vries en kookpunt voor zover onze middelen het ons veroorloven om de betreffende temperatuur te doen ontstaan zo heeft tenslotte ook elk gas zijn kritiek punt waar druk en afkoeling het tot druppels vloeibaar doen worden de zogenaamde constanten van de fysica de overgangspunten van de ene toestand in de andere red zijn voor het merendeel niet anders dan namen van knooppunten waar de kwantitatieve wijziging toevoer of onttrekking van beweging een kwalitatieve verandering te weeg brengt in de toestand van het desbetreffende lichaam waar dus de kwantiteit in de kwaliteit omslaat
7208398 men kan de chemie de wetenschap noemen van de kwalitatieve veranderingen van de lichamen ten gevolge van een veranderde kwantitatieve samenstelling dat wist hegel zelf reeds laten wij de zuurstof nemen als zich hier in plaats van zoals gewoonlijk twee atomen drie atomen tot een molecuul verenigen dan hebben wij ozon een lichaam dat door reuk en werking zeer duidelijk van de gewone zuurstof verschilt en wat valt er niet te zeggen van de verschillende verhoudingen waarin zuurstof zich met stikstof of met zwavel verbindt en waarvan elk een van alle andere kwalitatief verschillend lichaam vormt
7208399 dit is geheel en al hegels knooplijn van maatverhoudingen waar louter kwantitatieve toeneming en afneming op bepaalde knooppunten een kwalitatieve sprong veroorzaakt b v bij het verwarmen of afkoelen van water waar het kookpunt en vriespunt de knopen zijn waarbij zich de sprong in een nieuwe aggregatietoestand onder normale druk voltrekt waar dus kwantiteit in kwaliteit omslaat
7208400 is de dialectiek het onderzoek van de tegenstrijdigheden in het wezen van de voorwerpen zelf
7208401 betekent eenvoudig de opvatting van de natuur als datgene wat zij is zonder enigerlei toevoeging van buiten
7208402 de wereld de eenheid van alles is door geen godheid en door geen mens geschapen maar zij was zij is en zij zal eeuwig levend vuur zijn wetmatig ontvlammend en wetmatig uitdovend
7208403 een zeer goede uiteenzetting van de beginselen van het dialectische materialisme
7208404 het belangrijkste vraagstuk van de gehele filosofie zegt engels is het vraagstuk van de verhouding van het denken tot het zijn van de geest tot de natuur naar gelang deze vraag op deze of gene wijze werd beantwoord splitsten de filosofen zich in twee grote kampen zij die vasthielden aan de oorspronkelijkheid van de geest tegenover de natuur vormden het kamp van het idealisme de anderen die de natuur als het oorspronkelijke beschouwden behoren tot de verschillende scholen van het materialisme
7208405 de stoffelijke met de zintuigen waarneembare wereld waartoe wij zelf behoren is het enige werkelijke ons bewustzijn en denken hoe bovenzinnelijk het ook schijnt is het product van een stoffelijk lichaamsdeel de hersenen de materie is niet een product van de geest maar de geest is zelf slechts het hoogste product van de materie
7208406 men kan het denken niet scheiden van de materie die denkt de materie is het subject van alle veranderingen
7208407 het materialisme erkent in het algemeen het objectieve werkelijke zijn de materie onafhankelijk van het bewustzijn van het gevoel van de ervaring het bewustzijn is slechts de weerspiegeling van het zijn in het beste geval zijn bij benadering juiste adequate ideaal nauwkeurige weerspiegeling
7208408 de materie is datgene wat door zijn werking op onze zinnen gevoel voortbrengt de materie is de objectieve ons in het gevoel gegeven werkelijkheid de materie de natuur het zijn het fysieke is het primaire en de geest het bewustzijn het gevoel het psychische is het secondaire
7208409 het wereldbeeld is het beeld van hoe de materie zich beweegt en hoe de materie denkt
7208410 de meest afdoende weerlegging van deze evenals van alle andere filosofische grillen is de praktijk namelijk het experiment en de industrie
7208411 het moderne fide sme verwerpt geenszins de wetenschap het verwerpt alleen de
7208412 het is niet het bewustzijn van de mensen dat hun zijn maar omgekeerd hun maatschappelijk zijn dat hun bewustzijn bepaalt
7208413 de theorie wordt tot materi le macht zodra zij zich van de massas meester maakt
7208414 werken de mensen niet alleen op de natuur maar ook op elkaar in zij produceren slechts doordat zij op een bepaalde manier samenwerken en hun werkzaamheden tegen elkaar uitwisselen om te produceren treden zij in bepaalde betrekkingen en verhoudingen tot elkander en alleen binnen deze maatschappelijke betrekkingen en verhoudingen heeft hun inwerking op de natuur heeft de productie plaats
7208415 hoewel zij in de kiem reeds aan zekere dier soorten eigen zijn karakteriseren het gebruik en de schepping van arbeidsmiddelen onder arbeidsmiddelen verstaat marx hoofdzakelijk de productiewerktuigen het specifiek menselijke arbeidsproces en franklin definieert derhalve de mens als a toolmaking animal een dier dat werktuigen fabriceert het zelfde belang dat de structuur van beenderresten heeft voor de kennis van het organisme van uitgestorven dierengeslachten hebben de resten van arbeidsmiddelen voor de beoordeling van ten onder gegane economische maatschappijformaties niet wat er wordt gemaakt maar hoe met welke arbeidsmiddelen er gemaakt wordt onderscheidt de economische tijdperken de arbeidsmiddelen zijn niet alleen graadmeters van de ontwikkeling van de menselijke arbeidskracht maar ook de aanwijzers van de maatschappelijke verhoudingen waaronder gewerkt wordt
7208416 de maatschappelijke verhoudingen zijn nauw verbonden met de productiekrachten met het verwerven van nieuwe productiekrachten veranderen de mensen hun productiewijze en met de verandering van de productiewijze de wijze waarop zij in hun levensonderhoud voorzien veranderen zij al hun maatschappelijke verhoudingen de handmolen geeft ons een maatschappij met feodale heren aan het hoofd de stoommolen een maatschappij met industri le kapitalisten
7208417 wij leven te midden van een voortdurende beweging van het toenemen van de productiekrachten van de vernietiging van sociale verhoudingen van het vormen van idee n onbewegelijk is alleen de abstractie van de beweging
7208418 vat de economische productie en de daaruit noodzakelijk voortvloeiende maatschappelijke geleding van ieder historisch tijdperk de grondslag vormt voor de politieke en intellectuele geschiedenis van dat tijdperk dat dienovereenkomstig sinds de ontbinding van het oeroude gemeenschappelijke bezit van de grond de gehele geschiedenis een geschiedenis van klassenstrijden is geweest van strijd tussen uitgebuiten en uitbuitende overheerste en heersende klassen op verschillende trappen van de maatschappelijke ontwikkeling dat deze strijd thans echter een trap van ontwikkeling heeft bereikt waarop de uitgebuite en onderdrukte klasse het proletariaat zich niet meer van de haar uitbuitende en onder de bourgeoisie kan bevrijden zonder tegelijk de gehele maatschappij voor altijd van uitbuiting onderdrukking en klassenstrijd te bevrijden
7208419 begeven de mensen zich in bepaalde noodzakelijke van hun wil onafhankelijke verhoudingen productieverhoudingen die aan een bepaalde trap van ontwikkeling van hun materi le productiekrachten beantwoorden
7208420 het proletariaat zegt marx verenigt zich in de strijd tegen de bourgeoisie noodzakelijkerwijs tot een klasse het maakt zich door een revolutie tot heersende klasse en heft als heersende gewelddadig de oude productieverhoudingen op
7208421 het proletariaat zal zijn politieke macht gebruiken om aan de bourgeoisie stap voor stap alle kapitaal te ontrukken alle productie instrumenten in handen van de staat dat wil zeggen van het als heersende klasse georganiseerde proletariaat te centraliseren en de hoeveelheid van de productiekrachten zo snel mogelijk te vermeerderen
7208422 het geweld is de verloskundige van iedere oude maatschappij die van een nieuwe maatschappij zwanger gaat
7208423 in de maatschappelijke productie van hun leven begeven de mensen zich in bepaalde noodzakelijke van hun wil onafhankelijke verhoudingen productieverhoudingen die aan een bepaalde trap van ontwikkeling van hun materi le productiekrachten beantwoorden het geheel van deze productieverhoudingen vormt de economische structuur van de maatschappij de re le grondslag waarop zich een juridische en politieke bovenbouw verheft en waaraan bepaalde maatschappelijke bewustzijnsvormen beantwoorden de productie van het materi le leven bepaalt het sociale politieke en geestelijke levensproces in het algemeen het is niet het bewustzijn van de mensen dat hun zijn maar omgekeerd hun maatschappelijk zijn dat hun bewustzijn bepaalt op een bepaalde trap van hun ontwikkeling geraken de materi le productiekrachten van de maatschappij in tegenspraak tot de aanwezige productieverhoudingen of wat slechts een juridische uitdrukking daarvoor is tot de eigendomsverhoudingen binnen de grenzen waarvan zij zich tot nu toe hadden bewogen van ontwikkelingsvormen van de productiekrachten slaan deze verhoudingen om in kluisters daarvan dan begint er een tijdperk van sociale revolutie met de verandering van de economische grondslag wentelt zich de gehele reusachtige bovenbouw meer of minder snel om bij het beschouwen van zulke omwentelingen moet men altijd onderscheid maken tussen de materi le natuurwetenschappelijk nauwkeurig te constateren omwenteling in de economische productievoorwaarden en de juridische politieke religieuze artistieke of filosofische in een woord de ideologische vormen waarin de mensen zich van dit conflict bewust worden en het uitvechten evenmin als men datgene wat een persoon is beoordeelt naar datgene wat hij van zich zelf denkt evenmin kan men zulk een omwentelingstijdperk naar zijn bewustzijn beoordelen men moet veeleer dit bewustzijn verklaren uit de tegenstrijdigheden van het materi le leven uit het bestaande conflict tussen de maatschappelijke productiekrachten en de productieverhoudingen een maatschappijformatie gaat nooit ten onder voordat alle productiekrachten ontwikkeld zijn voor welke zij ruim genoeg in en nieuwe hogere productieverhoudingen verschijnen nooit voordat de materi le bestaansvoorwaarden daarvan in de schoot van de oude maatschappij zelf zijn uitgebroed daardoor stelt de mensheid zich altijd slechts taken die zij kan volbrengen want nauwkeuriger beschouwd zal steeds blijken dat de taak zelf alleen daar ontstaat waar de materi le voorwaarden om haar te vervullen reeds voorhanden zijn of zich ten minst in hun wordingsproces bevinden

7208462 participamos del debate educativo y congreso nacional de educaci n donde fueron recogidas muchas de nuestras reivindicaciones continuamos nuestra larga lucha para que estos insumos sean recogidos por la nueva ley de educaci n y permitan la permanencia de nuestra cultura
7208463 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7208464 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7208465 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo

7208493 the disgraced pastor at the centre of a fake cancer scandal has spoken for the first time about his
7208494 it is with much pain and sadness that i make this statement today
7208495 for over 16 years i have struggled with an addition to adult pornography as a result of this secret life of sin my body would often breakdown
7208496 id report the cause of my symptoms simply as illnesses and ive thrown my life into a ministry for many years trying to compensate for my sin
7208497 i believe that i do love jesus and i know that he loves me and it is this love along with the prayers of people around the world that bring me to this place of confession
7208498 two years ago i reported that i was suffering from cancer the truth is that although i was ill i did not have cancer but was again using the misdiagnosis to hid the lie that i was living
7208499 i know in my heart that it is the truth alone that will set me free and this is the reason for my confession
7208500 ive dishonoured god my wife my family and the church and i take full responsibility for my actions and would like to make it very clear that no one else was in any way aware of my double life
7208501 im fully commited to a process of discipline recovery and restitution and will see this process through to what ever extent is necessary
7208502 i am deeply sorry and pray that you will find it in your hearts to forgive me
7208503 currently i am undergoing professional medical assessment and evaluation to help identify and begin to treat the real and much deeper issues
7208504 please continue to pray for my wife and i and my family as we have a long hard road ahead of us but a road that im thankful to god that im finally walking
7208505 when michael rang me last tuesday i was on my way to new zealand
7208506 he said dad youve got to come and see me
7208507 i said to my wife maybe the doctors have told him hes only got a few weeks to live
7208508 so we cancelled everything and jumped on the plane and went to see him in melbourne and thats when he told us the story
7208509 we were just in absolute shock and we still are we havent had time to get our head around it he said i dont have cancer ive had two lives that ive lived
7208510 his wife amanda who has been with him for seven years found out the day before we did and shes had no idea
7208511 michael has had a severe addiction to pornography the addiction to pornography started when he was 12
7208512 its horrendous because we dont have that sort of stuff around he was raised in a christian home weve never brought that stuff into our home
7208513 he lived the two lives and he would get sick as a result of the guilt
7208514 he was feeling like he was letting god down letting his family down his church his friends
7208515 hes been living this for so long feeling like hes had these two lives and now hes the one thats come out in the open he confessed it he didnt get caught
7208516 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7208517 he hasnt done this for any reasons that have been portrayed that hes a fraud
7208518 it was either keep pretending or come out with the truth and tell everything hes come out with everything but now weve got the consequences of it all
7208519 we have to accept it were hoping to share with our congregation how it all started and how it got where it is
7208520 an addiction like this is not going to be fixed overnight you cant have a 16 year problem and fix it in a week
7208521 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7208522 the doctor believes that at times michael was totally convinced that he had this sickness
7208523 when he was about 12 he did vomit all the time hed get really really sick
7208524 he was in the adelaide childrens hospital for seven weeks at one stage he didnt eat and we thought we were going to lose him
7208525 they took out his appendix thinking that it might be that but they realised that it wasnt
7208526 they gave us the option of putting him in a psychiatric ward to see if there was something psychological but we felt uncomfortable with that at the time
7208527 we signed him out from hospital and then he would go a few months and then he would get sick again
7208528 wed always take him to hospital wed always do the proper thing but they couldnt get to the bottom of it until now
7208529 we have watched our son go through what we thought was cancer
7208530 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nosebleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7208531 every time we saw him we saw symptoms he stayed with us for a while where we had to put a special air conditioner in one of the rooms because he would heat up so much in the middle of winter
7208532 he had this cold air conditioner blowing on him to try to keep the heat down as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7208533 ive travelled the world asking people to pray for him can you imagine what a horrible thing it would be if i was playing a game
7208534 to be honest i ask myself as a father what did i miss what did i not do
7208535 the father of a disgraced melbourne preacher who faked a two year battle with cancer says his sons porn obsession fuelled the deceit
7208536 my wife and i over the past two years have watched him vomit in buckets having nose bleeds and even his hair fell out in clumps at one stage
7208537 as a professional minister ive stood in front of my congregation and cried and said to pray for my son
7208538 to deal with the guilt he would pour himself into doing good work hes touched the lives of young people all over the world now they are all affected by this
7208539 they have said to me that he is very ill they are assessing where reality stopped and fantasy kicked in and whats caused all this
7208540 but it is realistic fair and imperative to expect that smith and his coaching staff will find ways to get more out of a bears defense that isnt injured but obviously still is hurting itself
7208541 i have like a few of their songs especially this one song
7208542 haha im not a big fan of them i just like some of their songs i never said i was big fan
7208543 with the memory loss i think it sounds more like pcp
7208544 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
7208545 maverick reputation and some of it was frankly an admission that the modern republican party and congress which the former
7208546 when i first committed to john in january of 06 a lot of people thought i was crazy because we had just lost a midterm election
7208547 i said okay john im going to support you because i thought if he could get the nomination he would be president and i think he will be president
7208548 i said ive just got one thing i want to ask from you and i paused for maximum effect i wanted him to think i want to be maybe counselor or attorney general or secretary of commerce
7208549 there was nothing he could do for me or against me or to me that i hadnt already had done
7208550 so i said i just want one thing from you john
7208551 so im giving you the word i got from john mccain if he gets a little bit too far out of line he owes me a call and i can come back and say john dont do that
7208552 yeah maybe if we had a piece of paper and wrote down our preferences it might not be in either party mccain or democratic nominee sen
7208553 i talked to charlie black who is mccains policy director yesterday and i told him youve got to liven these rallies up
7208554 im gonna confess that john mccain and i probably fought more on issues than any other two republicans over the last 20 years
7208555 i fought him for four years on campaign finance reform because i thought he was wrong
7208556 but john and i even though we did battle regularly on that issue and i tried to stuff him every way i could
7208557 and i want to tell you something if you want to stuff john mccain you better bring your lunch it aint easy but we never lied to each other we never surprised each other and we got mad at each other but we never left each other so mad we couldnt come back the next day and work together
7208558 ill tell you what i learned about john on campaign finance reform and a lot of other issues the man will take a stand
7208559 i may not agree with him some of the best friends ive had in life i didnt agree with but i admired them because they had principles they had values they had things they believed in and they would stand and fight for america needs a president now who has character and courage and strength who will take on the tough issues in foreign policy in defense and economic issues
7208560 john used to harass me because i would get earmarks or pork barrel projects in
7208561 and i would say well yes john im a senator from and were the poorest state in the nation
7208562 but you know what in my heart i knew he was right
7208563 because we forgot how we got there what we believed in the principles that after 30 years put us in the majority gave us the white house the congress the senate the house and then we ran out of ideas
7208564 but that was an aberration thats not who we really are

7208569 deze week bekende een ex collega van jeroen dat hij deze priv informatie op de dag van de uitzending had gegeven aan een medewerker van de goochelaar bedrog dus
7208570 when i heard that i got the part my first reaction wasnt hesitancy exactly but oh no how am i going to do this
7208571 and my dads very supportive but hes going to keep his distance
7208572 richard greenberg takes so many american icons and weaves them into a story about baseball
7208573 theres the redneck the gay superstar the cynic whos just in the game for the money the play raises serious questions about race and class and homophobia but its also incredibly funny i fell in love with the story and im not even a sports fan
7208574 nudity on stage is still more common in new york
7208575 for a while it seemed that every time you turned around people were taking off their clothes
7208576 all i can say is i hope its warm in the theater
7208577 maybe well have the audience take off their clothes too and there will be absolutely no flash photography allowed
7208578 when we did the show in the spring of 2006 we chickened out and did it in very small towels
7208579 we needed 11 very talented actors who have to go back out into the community after the performance if theyd had to perform nude i think they would have been reluctant to accept the part
7208580 fashion is a means of individual expression transforming and changing along with your lifes phases and experiences
7208581 everything i was wearing had somewhat of a meaning to me which is common with most of my wardrobe the earrings were a gift from a dear friends shop in my hometown baltimore the organic cotton top was something that i took one look at while away at the beach and thought looked rather strange but tried it on anyway and it worked really well its a piece that i knew could be paired with either jeans or leggings in the summer or fall and the shoes were something i loved when i first saw them at nordstrom however they only had them in half a size too small i bought the shoes anyway and after a few days of squeezing my foot into them and stretching them out a little to fit theyve become one of my favorite pairs of shoes
7208582 im constantly shopping not necessarily always finding things to buy i dont enjoy going to places like the mall needing a bunch of new clothes its too overwhelming and before you know it you have a ton of clothing all from the same trend same season same time boring i go on missions for certain things whether i need a new shirt for work or a new pair of jeans i love to browse shopbop com and i often find nice tops from j crew shoes and denim from nordstrom and accessories and jewelry from all over i love finding jewelry and clothes at unique places or while traveling that way its something that reflects a place ive been or something ive done and its special
7208583 of course money is a factor i am a full time student i never spend a lot of money on items that are just a last minute trend
7208584 its been quite candidly pretty tough some of the time for me in my new job
7208585 but seriously cbs and couric should be pleased who wouldnt take an audience gain of 28 400 viewers these days and feel good about it
7208586 to see us gaining and making strides in some of these major markets is wonderful news
7208587 ive always felt proud of the broadcast even in the early days when it was so criticized for certain elements im one of these people who thinks its ok to take chances and to try things i always thought even the things that werent well received were noble efforts in trying to evolve the broadcast so the fact that were doing well is very gratifying
7208588 i think one of the most exciting aspects of my coming to this job was the chance to spread my wings on the internet
7208589 i think anybody who hasnt been living under a rock for the last 10 years understands how news consumption is changing dramatically and how the internet is playing an increasingly important role im a naturally interactive person in terms of my personal style and were trying to reach out to folks
7208590 on the internet its a much different sensibility they want it a little more raw less filtered less varnished and i think that plays to my strengths its sort of more of a today show sensibility in terms of being relaxed or being able to make a mistake or laugh at yourself or ask an off the wall question i always thought that hopefully i could be a successful bridge between traditional media and the internet just in terms of the way i communicate in a more casual way
7208591 even given the gains in cities like baltimore the question is can they build on them and improve the national ratings
7208592 they have to do that first and it takes time the question then becomes how long couric and cbs are willing to stick with it
7208593 i think she has been caught up in the desperate efforts of tv news to try to retain audience through an ill considered meshing of solid journalism and mush that has no true constituency i think couric is knowledgeable about the world and if she were allowed to do a harder edged newscast she might fare better
7208594 i have no plans to leave i want to do the best job i possibly can for cbs news i care about our newscast and my colleagues and i have no plans to split
7208595 a lot of people like to write about well shell leave here or shell leave there but thats never been an issue here
7208596 our managements been completely behind her and the correspondents and the producers are completely behind her and she has worked her tail off
7208597 you heartless thugs look what you did to my ballpark
7208598 the real thing its fun because no one has makeup and good clothes on baseball caps really work
7208599 its right up against interstate 695 the traffic sounds like music it takes me back to new york
7208600 i had an accident on a cruise ship almost a year ago and i have to use a walker to get around
7208601 id like to have a truckload of schlitz to go with me when i get to heaven
7208602 theyve got one at padonia station named after me its 24 ounces if you can eat one you get the second one free
7208603 i wish all the brave men fighting for our country could come home safe and sound
7208604 it constantly leaves you with a bit of a question which was pretty intentional on our part
7208605 it reveals itself but not entirely and not all at once youre rewarded the more you move around it you constantly see and learn new things about it
7208606 its a reflection of the people who are going to be in it
7208607 theyre going to be doing a lot of unpredictable things everyones trying to break new ground
7208608 on his way to judge the shorthorns at an agricultural fair
7208609 to explode forever the image of a cuddly old uncle
7208610 when youre sitting at home you have no other choice you look at other peoples paths in this league and in this position and theres not a whole lot of smooth stories there just isnt
7208611 at the surface you have to say flat out i dont agree with your opinion
7208612 really its what it comes down to i just flat out always thought that i could play i didnt waver when one gm or one personnel guy or one coach told me that i wasnt good enough for that team well all right thats your opinion thats all it is
7208613 its not even in my thinking right now dont know if it would come to that right now im thinking about my role and what i need to do
7208614 i felt like i put a lot into this studied more than ive ever studied in getting into this playbook and really try to understand it i dont know if i have any regrets i felt like i pushed myself as hard as i could
7208615 if we try to throw the ball around youre going to get penalties youre going to get the quarterback hit hes going to be running around a lot and youre going to be in trouble
7208616 it looked like kwame struggled a lot we missed probably at least four blitzes so im very discouraged it kind of reminds me of who we are
7208617 the coach wanted to go out and take as many pass plays as we could and see if we could execute
7208618 no matter what the down and distance was we were out there throwing the ball and it was pretty fun
7208619 even though a guys had two big seasons in his career a guys confidence can be shaken
7208620 just watching him catch a couple of balls he looked more confident as the game went on
7208621 i know when im in a groove i catch everything that comes my way
7208622 hes nipping at the corners and making guys put the ball in play
7208623 hes always had great stuff but he just hit a tough spot where he was leaving pitches over the plate hes not doing that now hes worked his way through the tough times and it has made him a better pitcher and a better person
7208624 thats a notch in my triple belt for the year
7208625 the first few innings i was definitely in a good tempo
7208626 the key is staying in that tempo no matter what is going on around me i got away from my approach that inning but it was nice to come back from that
7208627 im seeing the z man getting into a groove when hes pitching like that consistently
7208628 im sure of it hes too great a player not to win grand slam titles
7208629 the top three rafael nadal federer and novak djokovic is a fairly safe bet but a lot of others could
7208630 hes still a great player he just happened to lose a couple more matches than before theres a fine line between being a great player and not doing well
7208631 his bad days are more evident than before because he wins matches by creating shots
7208632 it comes with the territory its hard to stay on top for five years its hard to stay hungry
7208633 hes a counterpuncher who moves very well he doesnt like shots off pace but the slice is not my forte
7208634 aku pernah memenangi trofi ini di portugal dan inggris jadi kalau mungkin aku ingin memenanginya pula di sini pada kali pertama saya diminta untuk melakukannya
7208635 dalam sepakbola anda merajut hidup anda dengan titel juara kalau tidak sebaiknya kita bermain saja di rumah dengan anak anak kita
7208636 aku lebih senang bertanding ketimbang berlatih saja saya lebih suka pertandingan resmi daripada laga ujicoba juga pertandingan pertandingan yang lebih penting hakikat pekerjaan kami adalah memenangi partai partai seperti itu
7208637 i just feel that anybody that does that kind of thing shouldnt have a choice and they should be put to death just like what theyve done
7208638 my feeling of it is that he should get the death penalty
7208639 were going to ask you to watch a video of very graphic sadistic sexual abuse with a 9 year old child
7208640 it will be difficult for me to sit through absolutely

7208654 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7208655 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7208656 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7208657 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7208658 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7208659 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7208660 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7208661 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7208662 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7208663 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7208664 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7208665 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7208666 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7208667 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7208668 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7208669 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7208670 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7208671 its a great thing to honor the people on flight 93 by putting together all three attack sites the pentagon the world trade center and pennsylvania
7208672 i sense movement on both the speakers side and the mayors side
7208673 i will not support the repeal or change of term limits through any mechanism and i will oppose aggressively any attempt by anyone to make any changes in the term limits law
7208674 being the speaker who got people four more years she would certainly get reelected
7208675 she would be looking at four more years in the second most powerful job in the city of new york versus an uncertain shot at the most powerful job
7208676 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7208677 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7208678 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7208679 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7208682 i would be honored to run with or against john mccain because i think the country would be better off
7208683 than if any of the other clowns running for the republican nomination got it
7208684 the country will be better off when i become president because mccain just wants to give even more ruinous tax cuts to uber rich people like himself and cindy mccain
7208685 senator mccain youre no joe biden i knew joe biden
7208686 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

7208697 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7208698 in den vergangenen zehn jahren wurden f rderungen in der h he von rund 5 5 millionen euro ausgezahlt
7208699 vor dem umbau hatten wir einen kleinen laden in dem wir kein vollsortiment anbieten konnten das f hrte dazu dass viele bewohner von gai au gezwungen waren andernorts einzukaufen
7208700 diese f rderung ist ein klares bekenntnis zur nahversorgung in den kleinen und abgelegenen gemeinden vorarlbergs
7208701 f r die lebensqualit t in solchen ortschaften ist eine funktionierende nahversorgung ungemein wichtig dazu kommen positive umweltaspekte statt mit dem auto in die einkaufszentren zu fahren erreichen viele menschen ihr lebensmittelgesch ft gem tlich zu fu
7208702 we can all visit together and celebrate for all our birthdays
7208703 yeah and theyll be higher with my pickup truck if you want to go use your own car but ask someone else to drive you because im not going
7208704 i am not going to have cake and ice cream with a fucking serial killer
7208705 she must have forgotten what she said to me about never wanting me to be born
7208706 this is not for my own salvation but this is for yours and the hope of all of us together
7208707 its their first runway show but they know what theyre doing theyve done ralph lauren
7208708 this is her third year here so shes a veteran runway model
7208709 its so fun and such a joy to work with the dogs
7208710 it was kind of a wait and see well shoot for thursday
7208711 hes a michigan guy hes a real talented guy hopefully with him getting an opportunity here he can spend the next five days learning the offense and hopefully can have a real shot at showing what he can do next week
7208712 i think theres a niche for it and its something ill pursue later
7208713 its always nice to come back to where ive got some good memories
7208714 youd be lying if you say you dont ever look back and you know wonder
7208715 at each point in my life i made a decision i felt was best and was most comfortable with ive had a great run ive had a great time i wouldnt change anything but id be lying if i didnt sometimes wonder if you chose a different path or different timing
7208716 get to know everybodys name and hopefully they can get to know me see if i can find a way to help
7208717 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7208718 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7208719 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7208720 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7208721 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7208722 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7208723 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7208724 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7208725 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7208726 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7208727 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7208728 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7208729 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7208730 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7208731 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7208732 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7208733 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7208734 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7208735 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7208736 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7208737 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7208738 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7208739 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7208740 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7208741 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7208742 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7208743 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7208744 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7208745 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7208746 sportsmen like sushil kumar and abhinav bindra air rifle shooting olympic gold medallist have paved the path for more success to follow
7208747 should be tall natural and friendly rather than too pretty
7208748 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7208749 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7208750 its a sigh of relief especially with me because i take pride in it
7208751 so when im out there gaining zero yards or one yard it doesnt matter whose fault it is because it feels like my fault it doesnt matter if seven guys were free to hit me it still feels like there was something i could have done it does feel good when you get in there
7208752 a lot of times its two its three its negative two its nothing and then all of a sudden that big one hits
7208753 the running game is like that boxing match where a guy keeps hitting somebody in the body it doesnt really look like much early but later on they just get tired of getting hit in the body and then they let their guard down
7208754 youve got to throw body punches to make it crack
7208755 its got to be more consistent we had a couple that broke which is good but what i want is a punishment
7208756 i want to punish a defense i want to take their legs out of them so they cant rush thats what im trying to do will we run for 2 000 yards i dont know but i want to be physical
7208757 it will you cant just change your whole philosophy on how you run it and expect it to just click overnight
7208758 its frustrating for us as much as anybody to not see it go quicker to not see more big plays run off
7208759 im anxious for the regular season to start and well see what happens
7208760 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7208761 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7208762 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7208763 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7208764 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7208765 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7208766 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7208767 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7208768 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7208769 i dont think the race is so much about the political climate
7208770 i think its really about barack obama and john mccain
7208771 hes exciting hes likeable hes a great campaigner but then what said miami lawyer ira leesfield a top clinton fundraiser who now supports obama but is no longer aggressively raising money
7208772 i dont think this election is going to be decided on personality or how great you are its going to be about leadership and how great these candidates are as problem solvers i see this as being a real race
7208773 a lot of people dont know who he is and the convention gives him the opportunity to articulate to the american people who he is and what he wants to do as president
7208774 obama has an image problem and i think it was one that was created at the very beginning by being very successful motivating people and leading them down a path but at the end of that path he turned out to be not what was promised
7208775 the potential for us winning i think is greater than the democrats
7208776 but its going to require us to be at the top of our game particularly in florida
7208777 theyre both going to do vps weve got both party conventions weve got four debates in the fall and what we find is a lot of these undecided voters theyre paying attention but theyre going to click in a major way soon and well see how the dust settles but i think states like florida states like virginia states like ohio and some of the western states theyre going to be close throughout
7208778 theres the political climate and theres partisanship in the country
7208779 no ones going to walk away with the presidential race in an open race given the partisanship in this country thats not going to happen
7208780 probably in this phase the next four weeks and the decisions that are made will either create a bonding effect or it will create a centrifugal effect but if i were in reno id still bet on obama to win if he cant win this election the democrats ought to have someone else write the script
7208781 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7208782 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7208783 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7208784 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7208785 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7208786 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7208787 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7208788 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7208789 i think every american panics tons when something bad is happening
7208790 i dont think it will be a problem me having another ride
7208791 its just making sure you get the situation you want
7208792 one of the best working relationships ive ever had with a driver
7208793 i like this team i like being here its obviously a very competitive team right now
7208794 still the same driver hes just not getting everything lined up in a row that he needs to have go his way
7208795 i had a pretty good idea this was going on
7208796 in this business things dont stay quiet it has nothing to do with tony thats just down to your boss
7208797 as long as youre getting the job done then everything is good
7208798 if youre not getting the job done then hes going to look to see why and if you still dont get it done then youll probably be seeing the door on the way out
7208799 being in the national park service we got to see a lot of wonderful places
7208800 i appreciate history i love to photograph wildlife if they stand still long enough
7208801 since approximately 2000 when we moved to alaska i used a pentax 35 mm to photograph bears and wildlife especially the eagles using a powerful zoom lens i invested in a digital camera when we moved to tucson over the last few years digital photography has offered many advantages over film
7208802 i enjoy any opportunity to photograph landscapes flowers historic places and wildlife

7208811 atheism is so senseless when i look at the solar system i see the earth at the right distance from the sun to receive the proper amounts of heat and light this did not happen by chance
7208812 ultimately god will allow nothing to escape every detail of our lives is under his scrutiny god will bring us back in countless ways to the same point over and over again and he never tires of bringing us back to that one point until we learn the lesson because his purpose is to produce the finished product it may be a problem arising from our impulsive nature but again and again with the most persistent patience god has brought us back to that one particular point through this process god is trying to impress upon us the one thing that is not entirely right in our lives
7208813 there are a few things we need to talk about
7208814 you want me to give up all of these things
7208815 take this darkness away from me cut it out of my heart lord and take it from me forgive me for what i have done to shame you lord and please have mercy on me show me whats wrong and make me the person you want me to be

7208888 wenn das kraftwerk moorburg in betrieb geht steigt der co2 aussto hamburgs um 40 prozent wer jetzt neue kohlekraftwerke baut legt sich f r jahrzehnte auf eine fossile stromversorgung aus ineffizienten gro kraftwerken fest
7208889 obwohl die gro e mehrheit der hamburgerinnen gegen das kraftwerk ist versucht vattenfall den bau um jeden preis durchzusetzen dagegen ben wir heute zivilen ungehorsam
7208890 wir wollen eine soziale und kologische energieversorgung unter demokratischer kontrolle

7208892 die entschlossenheit und der mut der aktivistinnen war beeindruckend sie haben mehrere polizeiabsperrungen umgangen sowie z une und gr ben berwunden und wurden erst direkt am bauzaun mit massiver polizeigewalt zur ckgeschlagen wie abgesprochen sind wir auf die eskalationsversuche der polizei nicht eingegangen
7208893 auch wenn wir das gel nde heute nicht erneut besetzt haben musste vattenfall aufgrund unserer aktion die bauarbeiten wie schon am mittwoch ruhen lassen

7208897 per favore mi tolga da sotto gli occhi quella zampa mi fa orrore e tristezza
7208898 forse perch con quella zampa il castoro che adesso sta affondando i denti nel legno del bancone tentando darginare il dolore fino a pochi momenti fa ci si grattava e veniva pure bene bianca di tracce grosse come sputi
7208899 lei il solito invasato in ogni sputo ci trova lombra dun apocalittico complottismo
7208900 no io non trovo mai niente men che meno in lei
7208901 solo insignificante senza dire che la trovo cos mi suona meglio
7208902 adesso s che m tutto molto ma molto pi chiaro lei quel wu ming uno uno che ha scritto new thing
7208903 s capisco che lei stasera ha alzato il gomito e ha lalito pesante lo sa non mi stia colla bocca incollata sulla faccia
7208904 lei deve sapere che questo libro new thing il libro perfetto e il critico non se l cagato nemmeno di striscio non una riga
7208905 gi il critico adesso capisce pure lei perch sono tanto addolorato per smorzare il dolore non posso fare a meno damputare castori e marmotte che incontro sulla mia strada
7208906 psichedelico un charlie manson che se la prende cogli animali
7208907 ci avrei scommesso che lei era uno di quelli l vizioso
7208908 bravo immagino che ogni volta che amputa una zampa sente le note di coltrane nella sua scatoletta nera
7208909 s giusto sento le note che mi frullano in testa come unossessione e lei come fa a saperlo
7208910 oggi cos che si fa la critica tirando a indovinare
7208911 lei mi fraintende certo che lei non un critico ma io s sono pure un critico per hobby modestamente insomma ci sono rimasto perch lei tirando a indovinare ha capito subito che io per fare critica tiro a indovinare ecco
7208912 le ho fatto credere questo mi par strano ma se lo dice lei che wu ming uno ed pure un critico mi sa che sono costretto ad ammanettarmi il cervello e di conseguenza a darle ragione
7208913 no non mi fraintenda intendevo di metterci a nostro agio
7208914 no glielassicuro per me niente ma come se avessi accettato
7208915 e allora solo perch non sono un abituale non mi posso permettere di prendere il solito doppio cho pure il trespolo che mi son portato da casa mia
7208916 il fatto che il critico non mha cagato manco di striscio e io per sto fatto ci sono stato male e ci sto male ancora oggi e che non mi rassegno sono fatto cos sono uno dal cuore tenero ecco io credo dessere il centro delluniverso ma non per presunzione che sono il centro e lo vedono tutti che cos ma quello l il critico niente mha ignorato glielho dico io che cos quel critico un ateo un senza dio
7208917 e allora anche se fosse un ateo mica ha fatto del male a qualcuno
7208918 non ha fatto male a nessuno mi ha ignorato non ha speso una sola parola per il mio romanzo
7208919 e poi sarei io lapocalittico che soffre di manie e smanie di complottismo
7208920 s s adesso mi vorrebbe far credere che lei non lo conosce il critico ma io lho capito subito che lei uno dei suoi scagnozzi
7208921 da quando in quando i critici avrebbero gli scagnozzi al loro servizio e gi tanto quando si possono permettere una cicca e una puttana per una notte e lei mi viene a parlare di scagnozzi
7208922 vede vede che come dico io lei sa troppe cose
7208923 no si sbaglia il trespolo suo e non mi permetterei mai se l portato persino da casa tanto c attaccato rimanga pure comodo e io tanto per capirci sono un idraulico specializzato in tubi giro il mondo come faussone detto tito
7208924 ha vinto il premio strega nel 1979 lo strega importante mica robetta
7208925 s sar ma a me quelli che prendono lo strega mi stanno sullo stomaco anzi proprio non li posso digerire neanche allungati con della sana acqua sorgiva
7208926 invidioso e di che di chi io ho scritto il pi bel romanzo degli ultimi cento anni figurarsi se me la prendo perch non mhanno mai segnalato al premio strega e poi lei che ne vuol capire lei che soltanto un idraulico
7208927 s ha ragione io di letteratura non ne capisco un tubo per sono specializzato in tubi dovr pur significare qualche cosa
7208928 a proposito non le ho chiesto ancora il suo nome
7208929 e a che le servirebbe io sono un idraulico specializzato in tubi e fognature di lungo corso direi che abbastanza anche se le dicessi per assurdo che sono un parente alla lontana di alessandro magno dopo
7208930 niente questo il punto tanto vale che lei non lo sappia il mio nome non se ne farebbe niente
7208931 non che avreste un po di albert ayler di archie shepp o di bill dixon
7208932 no signore mi spiace ma non sono cocktail che io conosca
7208933 s molto di moda pensi che persino il nobel per la letteratura gabriel garcia marquez un suo incallito fan
7208934 se a marquez piace piacer pure a me che sono wu ming uno
7208935 lei mi sa che uno di quelli fissati colla figa
7208936 no non si sbaglia io amo le donne lei no
7208937 sa io leggo poco per quando leggo da un libro pretendo che dentro ci sia anche una componente sessuale altrimenti mannoio
7208938 cos per non far morire nel nulla la conversazione non troppo tempo fa non ricordo bene dove ho incontrato una tizia che si faceva chiamare sonia langmut be questa signora mha detto in un orecchio che nessuno dovrebbe mai morire
7208939 lei uno scrittore e pure un critico a tempo perso cos m parso di capire speravo potesse aiutarmi a capire
7208940 io non so niente so solo che il 21 luglio 1967 st peters church new york il funerale di john coltrane
7208941 e perch me lha detto allora non centra niente col discorso iniziato e io ci capisco ancor meno di prima
7208942 satira di preciso non saprei questo glielo dico proprio come fossi suo amico la satira una cosa complicata quindi io accantonerei qui e parlerei di tubi
7208943 be se lei a dirlo credo che possa esser cos anche se devo avvertirla che io di mito ecc ecc non ci capisco granch ma una volta ho avuto a che fare con uno che voleva che gli tirassi tubi per una lunghezza di cinque chilometri io gli spiegai che si trattava dun lavoro lungo e difficile e lui ha ribattuto che glandava bene purch facessi presto al che ho cercato di fargli capire che ci avrei impiegato parecchio tempo e lui ha ribattuto che glandava bene purch facessi bene allora sono stato costretto a puntualizzare che io da solo quel lavoro non potevo farlo e che non potevo dargli n una data n una sicurezza perch coi tubi non si sa mai come va a finire alla fine i tubi glielho tirati per tutti e cinque i chilometri impiegando cinque anni esatti di lavoro il problema stato che i tubi nel giro dun mese erano pronti ma poi sono intervenuti altri fattori soprattutto di tangenti ognuno voleva la sua fetta di torta per quei cinque chilometri di tubi
7208944 ma avevano dei diritti a vantare su quei cinque chilometri
7208945 sui tubi no ma sui cinque chilometri forse perch adesso ci passa il petrolio in quei tubi che son lunghi abbastanza
7208946 da una buco nel terreno che in mezzo al deserto
7208947 insomma una storiaccia come quella che pasolini ha abbozzato nel suo ultimo romanzo ma mai terminato petrolio
7208948 perch c tutta quella mitopoiesi che pasolini aveva iniziato in petrolio petrolio che poi confluito in scirocco di girolamo de michele un libro che ho fortemente voluto che ho spacciato al meglio delle mie possibilit in ogni angolo critico e acritico e acrilico
7208949 non chiaro ma forse colpa della mia ottusit io sono soltanto un idraulico specializzato
7208950 no puedo pedir que el invierno perdone a un rosal no puedo pedir a los olmos que entreguen peras no puedo pedirle lo eterno a un simple mortal y andar arrojando a los cerdos miles de perlas
7208951 questa canzone mi sta torturando sono dieci volte che la fanno passare
7208952 a me non dispiace certo non coltrane ma bisogna sapersi accontentare in fondo pure lei fa parte del grande progetto
7208953 le devo confessare che io quel libro lho letto per sbaglio
7208954 e andata pressappoco cos ero andato in libreria per comprare cento colpi di spazzola di melissa p ma tutte le copie erano finite esaurite sold out e stato il cassiere annoiato a rifilarmi new thing assicurandomi che mavrebbe tenuto il morale alto ma cos non stato mha buggerato ma la colpa stata mia avrei dovuto capirlo che mi stava rifilando na sola ce laveva scritto in faccia su quella sua faccia annoiata e schifata
7208955 effettivamente s per sbaglio mha molto annoiato e finito nella top 100 dei libri pi noiosi che abbia mai letto
7208956 s il fatto che io ho letto due libri in tutta la mia vita
7208957 che io sappia non s mai vista una top 2
7208958 ho letto new thing e il mio primo libro di catechismo questi i soli libri della mia vita ma in tutta sincerit il catechismo molto meglio del suo romanzo per quanto io capisca poco o niente di letteratura praticamente un tubo per uno che ignorante come me s pure uno che ignorante come me lo capisce subito quando un libro noioso e quando invece no il suo mha spinto sul baratro della pi profonda depressione non le dico quante sedute psicosomatiche per venirne fuori
7208959 s non tutti sono acuti come lei spero sappia sturare bene i lavandini
7208960 posso farle una domanda imbarazzante prima di mettermi al lavoro
7208961 ho visto che ha una copia di new thing lha letto
7208962 abbiamo parlato o meglio stato lui ad attaccare bottone con me
7208963 bene mi sembra che non ci sia nulla di male
7208964 no non mi turba affatto sono sulla bocca di tutti i rischi del mestiere
7208965 capisco a ogni modo wu ming uno s lamentato con me che lei non lha cagato manco di striscio
7208966 s quello che ho cercato di fargli capire pure io
7208967 e come dice lei pretendeva che lei se lo cagasse assurdo
7208968 ma le piaciuto il libro di questo wu ming uno
7208969 se mi fosse piaciuto non starebbe in quellangolo a tappare un buco
7208970 s un buco occupato da alcuni maledetti topi grossi come salmoni sono sicuramente dei topi che hanno subito qualche alterazione del dna ma me ne occuper a tempo debito dopo che lei mavr sturato il lavandino per adesso new thing pu bastare quei bastardi non ce lhanno mica il coraggio di rosicarsi quel libro lo temono pi dellinferno in fondo in fondo il lavoro di quel wu ming uno servito a qualcosa domani se mi alzer col piede giusto magari gliele scrivo due righe ma adesso si occupi del lavandino le faccio strada

7208973 the two presidents have agreed on the need to set up an international mechanism under the osce aegis to replace russian patrols in the security zone in the south from south ossetia
7208974 there was no discussion of an issue related with the replacement of the russian peacekeeping forces with monitors from osce
7208975 during the conversation with nikola sarkozy dmitry medvedev reaffirmed russias readiness to cooperate with osce in this zone in accordance to the fifth principles of the six point ceasefire accord developed jointly by the french and russian presidents

7208982 die bundesregierung erwartet dass russland den abzug jetzt unverz glich vollendet und seine truppen vereinbarungsgem auf die linien vor ausbruch der feindseligkeiten zur ckzieht

7208990 ummm mommy i dont want to get in here right now
7208991 you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it aint about how hard ya hit its about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward
7208992 sounds like you are giving us a sneak peak of steamy tales from the boudoir m
7208993 wir beobachten bei welchen titeln sich dies noch lohnen wird und werden in zukunft m glicherweise weitere ps2 spiele auf der ps3 per emulation zum laufen bringen
7208994 the feature has previously been available on singstar games for both playstation 2 and playstation 3 but for the first time owners of singstar for ps3 will be able to play songs from ps2 discs in their collection
7208995 we added to the ps3 singstar game engine the ability to read and decode the tracks from a singstar disc for ps2 keeping it within the ps3 game also means you can still play your downloaded tracks

7208998 i want every parent to be a pushy parent it is a jolly good thing
7208999 we will make a political decision in due course on where we go beyond 400
7209000 on the basis of the results and the demand the only issue is how far
7209001 we have 100 opening in 2010 there will be very strong pressure from parents and local authorities to maintain that rate
7209002 for 2008 qnb estimates nominal gdp growth to remain strong at 19 5 per cent underpinned by several factors
7209003 the new port will provide facilities and services of high international standards to the traders local industries shipping lines and other businesses the port combined with the bahrain logistics zone which is also nearing completion will make bahrain a major logistics hub in the region
7209004 i am impressed by the developments taking place at the new port especially those relating to the customs facility every effort will be made to ensure a smooth transition of the customs operations from mina salman to khalifa bin salman port

7209006 that is a very interesting question you should ask the club
7209007 he didnt play because he wasnt in the right condition this is what he told me before the game when i spoke to him so he did not play
7209008 well have to wait and see well speak to the player and then well make a decision on his future
7209009 we wont be dancing in the streets in sunderland for beating tottenham away from home well have a cup of tea and sandwich as normal
7209010 we fancy our chances and were happy with the progress were making players showed the other side to them the character of the players is there for everyone to see we have that and you can criticise in other areas but not character
7209011 there is such a terrific spirit about the place and among the players and that spirit will really help us go so far
7209012 it was a good game it ebbed and flowed we had our good moments in the match and they had their good moments
7209013 but it was a fantastic atmosphere today which helped the players and we have got to make that a regular occurrence here
7209014 i am still very positive because the fact is we have been beaten in the last minute of the game
7209015 over the whole period i thought we should have got at least something from the game after we scored two very good goals
7209016 it is too early to start cutting up players as it were we have played two games in the premier league and weve scored six goals so scoring doesnt seem to be our problem at the moment we scored a lot of goals last season and conceded quite a number
7209017 we were not sharp enough in the first half and our passing was certainly not as good as we expect it to be i dont know why
7209018 you have to give credit to fulham they played very well and they started sharper than us
7209019 we dominated the second half but i felt in the last 25 minutes we were too nervous and wanted to just hit the ball up there rather than create a chance
7209020 we paid a big price for the mistake on their goal we should be able to cope with a corner when it comes in at low level like that
7209021 you are right that is a fact but we have to face it because from all our possession we could not produce many chances frankly the performance was just not good enough
7209022 jag verkar vara en k nslig kille som inte kan sortera sina intryck
7209023 this little light of mine i m gonna let it shine let it shine let it shine let it shine
7209024 i could go out there but im not sure i would get the results
7209025 the first time i went out there in frederick i had a little nerves when i went out there its definitely good to get these innings in
7209026 for me this is a tremendous accomplishment this guys work ethic has been off the charts i want to see him in the clubhouse and i want him to be part of the club theres a place on this team for him next year hell be pitching in some role at the end of games next year
7209027 right now im just getting myself ready to play at the bigleague level whether it be the sixth seventh eighth ninth inning it doesnt really matter at this point
7209028 obviously anytime velocity is down its a concern especially when youre used to looking at a power pitcher
7209029 daniel is a power guy when you start to see that you start to say is he ok but he said that he feels good he feels strong
7209030 anything is possible and believe me weve talked about a lot of those things
7209031 obviously a guy that is throwing the ball with conviction and feels confident in what theyre doing they get more out of what theyre doing
7209032 i think it would suit him better to know when hes going to pitch to get him more on a routine of what he does in between starts
7209033 he made some good pitches when he had to he got out of some jams
7209034 he had pretty good command for a guy that hasnt pitched that much lately
7209035 i wasnt trying to fool nobody i just looked down at the ball in the dirt and thought i better run to first base
7209036 i was waiting for the batboy to come and get my helmet then i saw the umpire do nothing i decided i better go to first
7209037 the hitter walked toward the dugout to throw his bat and helmet away he in doing so has abandoned his effort to reach the next base
7209038 i am not going to talk about that because ill probably say something that i shouldnt
7209039 ive never had an experience like this in my life
7209040 ive never been in front of so many people i just imagined that everybody was in seventh and eighth grade
7209041 i thought my friends set me up i didnt believe it im still not believing it
7209042 senator obama let me ask you about evil does evil exist and if it does do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it do we defeat it
7209043 ive had better weeks ive had better months but i dont regret anything were here battling it out i dont remember losing as many games anywhere else but hey you cant erase it youve just got to try to snap out of it
7209044 its not like we have a 100million team out there losing 12 in a row we want to win just as much as any other team but sometimes the other teams are just better
7209045 i can say i dont feel like i need a day off
7209046 third party title as mirrors edge by electronic arts are part of this strategy
7209047 according to reeves mirrors edge will initially exclusively for the ps3 this year pc and xbox 360 versions would follow much later
7209048 we know so far nothing but it is possible that there is collusion at the highest level of which we are still not informed
7209049 i am in a fine place at the moment life is great i have been on my own journey and been through my own demons but i have broken the chain and am in a happy place
7209050 i have always worked always paid national insurance and i have never been on the dole
7209051 i do work hard but it has given me a new life and i feel very grateful i love acting it is what i do and its sad that so many people today just want to be famous for being famous
7209052 i love them so much they are two wonderful boys and i really want to give them a normal childhood glastonbury this year and i did not want him to go but we have a very democratic system and his father jim felt he was ready
7209053 i was over ruled by it and he went i wasnt happy but i later found out that he was well looked after and he came back looking great we had a wonderful chat about how much he enjoyed it and i am really glad he went now
7209054 he is such a great boy as is lennon who i love reading stories to at night when i get home from holby
7209055 i would call it the oddest game i ever played in
7209056 i think lenn was probably the strongest guy on the team but im not sure he could have even thrown the ball to second without bouncing it
7209057 i was just hoping theyd hit it to short for cal or first for eddie murray
7209058 they both had the range of a dime so not much coverage there
7209059 we strongly condemn this heinous crime the guilty will be dealt with stringently
7209060 this is history for kenya i am glad to have this one
7209061 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners and because my body gets tired when i slow down
7209062 i tried to push with six kilometres left it was hard but they couldnt keep up
7209063 the start was ok because it wasnt so hot but during the race the weather was bad in the last 10km it was unbelievable what the kenyans and africans were able to do in these conditions
7209064 since a politician never believes what he says he is quite surprised to be taken at his word
7209065 every power cut even if it lasts for just a few minutes delays water production by three hours
7209066 there wasnt a lot of focus from the former regime on the long term consequences of dumping raw sewage onto river banks
7209067 we have people illegally siphoning water from the pipelines using potable water to irrigate their gardens and fill their fish pools
7209068 even water used by car washes this wasted water could be used in areas already suffering from shortages
7209069 the water is dirty but what can we do we dont have any other choice
7209070 people like us who earn three or four dollars a day we spend it all on generators
7209071 as soon as you build new plants and you lay down new networks you will be able to service more people
7209072 now they apparently have enough resources and theyre slowly moving toward using those resources
7209073 we were drinking vin blanc in the estaminet small caf and it was absolutely crowded
7209074 there were five women in there and it was five francs to go up the stairs and into the bedrooms with them
7209075 they were always pleased to welcome les anglais aviateurs plenty money there was marguerite the little tubby one who looked lovely fifi the tall dark one was also a favourite there was one with a very flat nose like a boxer who we nicknamed pug and a very big girl with fat legs that we called tiny fun ran high and we spent a lot of money on cheap champagne which was all that mattered to the girls
7209076 in one estaminet a very kind old french lady was dispensing coffee from a jug and two girls in their late teens were dispensing pills which they assured us would give us additional power in our amorous exploits colonel hayley bell was our colonel at the time he was the grandfather of the actress hayley mills and he was greedy he took two
7209077 on about the third night i woke up with a funny little movement round my bottom
7209078 he sort of muttered in his sleep or so i thought and i dropped off again
7209079 and he never opened his mouth except to say that on his way to his billet hed slipped over and got gravel rash down one side of his face
7209080 i was sorry for him afterwards because everybody was sex starved there was no such thing as real girls around he was probably in that mood and anything was good enough but if i was good enough i didnt want to be
7209081 for obama supporters this is like finding out from your neighbor instead of your sister that shes engaged not how you want or expect the news to be delivered
7209082 i used to trust obama but now that despite his best efforts the press leaked his pick a few hours early so the west coast found out about it before i did i dont know how i can every trust him again
7209083 despite their alarms and the safe i was able to rob the familys jewelry im just not sure i can ever feel safe in their house again
7209084 barack obama has now betrayed his supporters by not giving them the first opportunity to hear his choice
7209085 the olympics demonstrated the success of the current system and the communist partys determination not to reform politically there is no reason to change
7209086 it still has many problems such as the possibility of an economic slowdown

7209094 this choice of biden is disappointing because he is the creator of the idea of dividing iraq
7209095 we rejected his proposal when he announced it and we still reject it dividing the communities and land in such a way would only lead to new fighting between people over resources and borders iraq cannot survive unless it is unified and dividing it would keep the problems alive for a long time

7209152 non viewers perceive television to have power they believe it can steal time can affect consumer behavior and can influence how autonomous children are
7209153 based on the interviews the surveys and the time use diaries it appears that those who do not watch television not only reject television in order to keep sex violence shallow news coverage and consumerism out of their lives but also to encourage family interaction their childrens independence and creativity and a wise use of their time

7209166 since vitamin d is produced in the skin through solar or uv irradiation and high serum levels have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of ms this suggests that vitamin d may regulate the immune response and may promote a hosts reaction to a pathogen
7209167 evidence has shown that the maintenance of an adequate vitamin d level may have a protective effect in individuals predisposed to ms
7209168 one device of vitamin d action may be to preserve balance in the t cell reaction and thus avoid autoimmunity

7209172 the next us president is going to deliver the most significant moment in american history since franklin roosevelt he will have such an incredible opportunity not only to change the direction of america but literally to change the direction of the world
7209173 this is no ordinary election and this may be our last chance to reclaim the america we love america gave jill and me our chance it gave barack and michelle their chance to stand on this stage today its the time for all of us as lincoln said to put our feet in the right place and to stand firm

7209196 90 minute long godawful pop culture references that become stale by the time the it has finished being filmed
7209197 i came here the day after finishing the martin scorsese
7209198 i just had the flight time between the two filming schedules essentially thats how its working out its pretty well back to back right now
7209199 which is great because the variety of work i can choose to do now is stupendous i can choose to do a film like
7209200 i can also really allow myself to push the parameters of recklessness in my work i dont mean in my discipline but i do mean in the performance although im absolutely word perfect on the text i did allow myself to be a lot looser and more reckless in
7209201 and i can also choose to play a silly little role like in
7209202 for the most part if you look at my cv
7209203 very often im either the moral center of the film or the political center of the film but to be part of the comedic half of the film as in
7209204 so those four films in philadelphia pretty well represent what im allowed to do now what i allow myself to do and the great position i find myself in which is having these wonderful choices so i say yes i can do that for mike myers that would be wonderful as well as of course doing this immensely committed and dedicated role with penelope in elegy
7209205 there was no accent there is no disguise the clothes i wore could have been mine
7209206 its the closest that ive ever been to sounding and looking like me
7209207 but in order to be challenged by the role and feel the danger in playing him i had to get out of my suit of armor i had to get out of my actors disguise tricks so that was a constant challenge hearing my own voice coming out of my head saying those lines
7209208 i think for me the sustained difficulty was not to judge the character nor to sentimentalize him but ushering him up exactly as he is to the audience and let them accept him without any filtering of my judgment
7209209 so i had to be free of any judgment of him positive or negative and as i say to remove as many layers as possible through which to filter him

7209290 the youthful and charismatic barack obama may often be compared to john f kennedy but ronald reagan poses the more interesting parallel like the republican who swept into the white house in 1980 obama is an outstanding orator whose national political rise coincides with a grass roots movement demanding fundamental change in america many democrats underestimated reagan because of his inexperience ardent ideology and lofty but sometimes vague rhetoric yet the former hollywood actor and california governor surprised opponents by leading a revolution in domestic and foreign policy aided by shrewd advisers and outside activists reagan cut taxes slashed social service spending and ushered in a tough international stance in so doing reagan became one of americas most influential presidents in the post world war ii era major redefinition does not come easily institutional barriers remain that will slow action news reporting will focus on daily blips rather than the new presidents substantive priorities and citizen cynicism will make many americans doubt his sincerity large scale change may prove elusive even if democrats control congress and the white house yet just as reagan harnessed the financial organizational and intellectual energy of activists so could obama he can push the activists values as reagan did but cannot pursue every idea that his supporters propose most important obama should study reagans style reagan was a strong leader who left an enduring legacy because he thought big hired smart people delegated details to staff and did not let the highest office in the land overwhelm him obama must keep his focus on broad vision and large scale change not minute policy details obama may already have the political insulation that gave reagan the moniker of the teflon president he has survived questions about his relationship with a fiery minister and his own controversial comments about small town american life in overcoming these landmines obama may have demonstrated that he is more like reagan than many would like to admit

7209360 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7209361 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 percent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7209362 thats just the way it is some things will never change
7209363 people automatically assume that if it weakens the hazards go down with it but in the case of rainfall its not a function of wind speed
7209364 my parents grew up during the great depression and they had to conserve to survive
7209365 but they not only learned how to make do with a lot less but also how to have fun with it
7209366 they really did learn that the best things in life are free
7209367 grew up at a time when resources were cherished and they summoned the creativity to make quilts from old clothing artwork from potential discards and repairs with available scraps
7209368 my mother irrigates the garden with rinse water from the washing machine she makes rugs out of old pantyhose as the recipient of a holiday card she cuts off the artwork to send as a postcard
7209369 she saves hair clippings to fill pincushions and is rumored to hoard used dental floss plastic storage bags are washed out and reused uneaten food is frozen and served
7209370 my mothers primary mode of transportation is a decades old schwinn and her sewing machine is a half century old singer and yes my mother darns socks
7209371 and she is one of the happiest people i know
7209372 the critics of conservationism and environmentalism argue that those of us who want to conserve and lead simpler lives would have everybody wear grass skirts and live in a cave
7209373 part of the title of the book moderation reflects that many of us are actually practical and use common sense in our efforts to conserve our resources
7209374 i am not preaching conservationism im trying to show how it actually makes people happier than buying and using too much stuff
7209375 we dont lead exemplary lives that they and others do but we try to do our part and even what little we do compared to others has made us happier
7209376 i went for a year without buying all the gadgets and clothes and other non essentials that i used to purchase
7209377 i actually had more fun going without all that stuff than i did when i was buying it i also saved some money as well
7209378 the areas of the country that saw prices go through the roof and then fall into the basement wont be the first ones to see an upturn
7209379 its more likely to come in a place like cleveland or other midwestern cities that largely missed the boom
7209380 if you look at cleveland or minneapolis theyre almost back to where they started
7209381 most other parts of the country have a ways to go before they can say that
7209382 the best time to invest is when you have money this is because history suggests it is not timing the markets that matters it is time
7209383 to buy when others are despondently selling and to sell when others are avidly buying requires the greatest fortitude and pays the greatest ultimate rewards
7209384 our mother worked hard to keep our home and her family happy
7209385 she was always smiling and loved to see her grandchildren
7209386 they liked to sing and dance and they played the guitar and sang all the old songs
7209387 she loved to tell us about it and would laugh all the kids would sit on it at the top and ride it all the way down
7209388 she was very excited about that and saved all of the newspaper clippings
7209389 our father worked as a foreman and machinist at the torrington company and our mother stayed home and took care of us
7209390 i remember walking home from forbes school and she would have lunch for us she was always there for us with a hot meal and we always had our friends come over
7209391 she had a feisty personality and loved to laugh she was a lot of fun to be with and was very outgoing and sociable
7209392 but most of all she loved her family and enjoyed being near her grandchildren her grandchildren meant the world to her
7209393 we knew going in the possibility of it not being successful thats historically true about essay contests

7209397 our merchandise assortment for summer was very well received by customers and our sharpened e commerce marketing and merchandising efforts helped to drive web traffic and sales
7209398 sales for the quarter came in better than we expected due to strong and earlier than anticipated shipments of our new products so far weve received excellent feedback and we are seeing strong sell through at retail for tag leapster 2 and didj are just being introduced but early indications are promising particularly at leapfrog com
7209399 we have two remaining launches left for the year the leapfrog learning path which will debut in august as i alluded to earlier and crammer our study and sound system which will launch in the early part of the fall later in the fall we are going to share with you the details of how we expect our strategy to evolve in the coming years but for now you should know that we have quite an extensive product plan laid out through 2009 and into 2010 and 2011 the first elements of this will be on display at toy fair in october

7209442 the american dream under eight years of bush and mccain that american dream is slipping away
7209443 these times require more than a good soldier they require a wise leader a leader who can deliver
7209444 you cant change america when you know your first four years as president will look exactly like the last eight years of george bushs presidency
7209445 ive been disappointed in my friend john mccain who gave in to the right wing of his party and yielded to the very swift boat politics that he once so deplored
7209446 folks campaigns for presidents are a test of character and leadership
7209447 thats not a worry has to worry about its a pretty hard experience he will have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7209448 were happy but it doesnt mean anything until you get to the regular season
7209449 weve got to take what we did and improve on what weve done defenses arent giving us what they would in the regular season so you dont really know so you have to put things aside and be realistic about it too
7209450 we took it back to the film room and me selvin and pitt saw a lot of holes that we missed in the last two games
7209451 so we went back to basics reading the defense and hitting up in there read the zone and get downhill thats all that was
7209452 no escuches ning n mal no hables ning n mal y no veas ning n mal
7209453 offensively defensively we just played teams that both won 13 games last season in the last two weeks and i think the starters did what we needed to do for the most part we got some things to look at but if we played the whole game i think we would have come away fine
7209454 we knew he was going to be one on one thats what youre going to get youre going to get some deep balls from us

7209461 the rule book went out the window in the 1960s and it was every person for him or herself
7209462 we were all left to our own devices to make up our own rules about language sex socially acceptable behavior gender loyalty and much more
7209463 they burned their bras got jobs took control of their bodies with birth control pills started divorcing in great numbers smoked cigarettes and other stuff and started swearing
7209464 the f word became commonplace among comics richard pryor george carlin among others
7209465 public expression of the f word became more acceptable as a result

7209490 it is amazing that we have such learned individuals to condemn the president and do not have the knowledge
7209491 we received a letter from the office of us attorney for the southern district of new york michael j gracia late friday in which he acknowledged of having in custody aafia siddiquis eldest son ahmed who will turn 12 years old in november
7209492 the disclosure that ahmed is in us custody is a great development
7209493 i have a feeling that dr afia may be repatriated to pakistan very soon possibly before september 3 or soon afterwards
7209494 this might be a wishful thinking but at least this hope is what is keeping our whole family on our feet
7209495 we strongly condemn this heinous crime the guilty will be dealt with stringently
7209496 this is history for kenya i am glad to have this one
7209497 i had to push the pace to tire the other runners and because my body gets tired when i slow down
7209498 the start was ok because it wasnt so hot but during the race the weather was bad in the last 10km it was unbelievable what the kenyans and africans were able to do in these conditions
7209499 when youre building a car no matter what you do you have someones life in your hands
7209500 we have a lot of experience dealing with these kids who had everything going against them and they pulled themselves up and succeeded in a tough environment
7209501 now were in a completely different demographic hopefully well be able to share with them the stories of our students if they can succeed in a difficult situation i know you can do it

7209504 my motto in this whole process of becoming a teacher is if i can argue a case in front of a federal judge surely i can educate 20 kids
7209505 teaching gives me the opportunity to give back especially to this particular community
7209506 theres nothing wrong with becoming a police officer or a firefighter but there are also jobs in human resources doctors lawyers accountants and consulants
7209507 when i left the ship or left the job i left the language
7209508 i dont think anybody should be subject to that kind of language
7209509 ive got three daughters and i dont want to go to a place to eat and shop and hear the f word
7209510 i hear more adults saying it if were being the role models what do you expect
7209511 the bartender determines what is or isnt bad language and even if its in the bible that does not make it acceptable thou shalt not cuss
7209512 you might think that the people getting asked to leave would be bikers sailors
7209513 i could sit here and let them cuss and make a lot more money
7209514 but youve got to have some standards were not animals

7209516 its funny sometimes youre walking by the paint booth and you hear an aw s

7209520 eighteen million democratic primary voters donated money volunteered their time and energy worked very hard and then not only supported senator clinton but voted for her
7209521 all the efforts of supporters of legitimate citizens were for nothing because obama lied and cheated his way into a fraudulent candidacy and cheated legitimately eligible natural born citizens from competing in a fair process
7209522 to avoid the obvious problems that will occur when the republican party raises these issues after obama is nominated
7209523 i can imagine no greater disservice to the country than to establish a system of censorship that would deny to the people of a free republic like our own their indisputable right to criticize their own public officials
7209524 by eliminating anonymity the thinking goes the amount of online bile will diminish perhaps at the cost of fewer overall comments at the same time the bee will stop its practice of online editors screening every comment which has led to hours long delays and allow reader self posting
7209525 so i asked readers what they thought of the changes and a few dozen responded
7209526 several others though said the bee was over reacting and infringing on freedom of speech a few said anonymity allowed those inside government institutions such as law enforcement the freedom to question and challenge supervisors higher up the food chain without fear of repercussions

7209586 its important for congress to draw lines rather than dealing with this on an ad hoc basis it will be really interesting to see if the fed accepts that notion

7209609 the price of tuition is just so ridiculous and with the economy being so bad you just have to do it as fast as you can and get out
7209610 accelerating can solve one major problem by saving money but it can intensify the academic pressures of trying to take on a great deal of demanding work at the same time

7209650 i take it as what is j t is the starter and im the no 2 im going to continue to prepare and get ready knowing i am one play away im familiar with that obviously having gone through it last year im going to continue to prepare as if i was playing
7209651 this is a new role for me to get to watch another guy play
7209652 theres ups and downs in this game everyone goes through it its a new role for me im going to take it on and make the best of it
7209653 early on maybe a better job of picking up how this offense works i came to work prepared i felt like i put a lot into getting into this playbook and really trying to understand it i dont know if i have any regrets i pushed myself as hard as i could
7209654 not given the way things have gone the last three weeks weve looked good under osullivan and the offense is moving the ball well

7209666 but oil fell significantly and gold and base metals were down
7209667 the waxing and waning weve seen between the financials and resources is going to continue
7209668 more weakness in late september october is anticipated as the global economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue
7209669 i think the public is starting to focus a lot more on the crude oil price and that it is a major constituent of the petrol price
7209670 theres also more focus on the fact that the tax on petrol is over 50 cents a litre
7209671 we dont like to have more regulation in our industry theres a lot already
7209672 but overall the impact on our business we feel would be quite neutral whether it was in or out

7209677 this negative campaign ad is clearly express advocacy and under a federal law passed in 2003 the bi partisan campaign reform act known colloquially as mccain feingold it cannot legally be paid for with corporate money including those of a non profit
7209678 the ad indisputably concerns an election takes a position on the character and fitness for office of a candidate and raises no legislative issue even this highly skeptical supreme court would turn up its noses at the foul odor emitted by this clear abuse of federal election law

7209709 that really changed the dads mind about how wise kids are using technology
7209710 his point was that schools shouldnt ban the use of the devices but learn from the students and also create an environment that promotes technology
7209711 its exciting but i think we need to stay focused on what the outcomes are for kids as far as content
7209712 if a student brings their own laptop is it going to be on the schools network then what about viruses and filtering
7209713 im not sure schools are quite comfortable with it yet
7209714 one of the things weve talked about in proctor and west rutland because we have the small schools is maintaining the diversity of classes with a low enrollment with the camera software we could perhaps offer the class at one school and have students at the other taking it
7209715 what people are most excited about and interested in is all the negative stuff out there i liken the experience to taking your kids to washington d c there are streets that you better not let them go down and there are others that they shouldnt die without seeing
7209716 how do you accommodate the students that dont have the technology how do you equalize the access
7209717 its a way we can introduce math concepts without any kind of stress on the student without them having to memorize a bunch of rules first

7209725 you complain about being lonely because you disregard everybody else youre selfish self centered pretentious and you believe you deserve the best you see no point in the birthdays barmitzvahs gatherings and functions of those who prioritize yours you only look for people accordingly to what they can offer you you believe travelling to a friends house is a chore you do not see the urgency in meeting somebody who is already waiting for you you wont have a lover because those who believe in love believe in the opposite of what you do you dont have an ambition interest or hobby something to spark interest from another you dont have true friends because nobody knows that youre all of the above and you complain about being lonely

7209728 this place is a symbol of the vietnamese soldiers courage
7209729 when i see this place i think of all the people who gave their lives to liberate vietnam
7209730 it prevents them from being able to live in a new space really functionally and have it esthetically pleasing as well
7209731 what you have to do is just look at it from the other tack and say what will this space hold then from that you go into your own home and you start shopping your home
7209732 if you look at it that way its sort of an opportunity to help others to perhaps buy yourself new things with the sale of your old and to start living in your new smaller space with just the right amount of things in it so that its a pleasant place to come home to
7209733 it prevents you from having to stack things on top of each other that way everything is very easily accessible
7209734 anything that you can put on the wall to free up floor space will help make your room feel bigger whether its open shelving or hooks on the wall
7209735 if theyre positioned in such a way that they reflect light from a window or that they reflect something beautiful to make the room look like its larger than it is that will help
7209736 it can be a nice cream shade pale yellows pale blues pale greens
7209737 sometimes painting the ceiling in the same tone as the wall can help too because with a stark white ceiling your eye is drawn to it and it immediately shows that theres just the small space
7209738 rather than buying a bright red sofa that youll tire of in two years get a neutral colour and red accent cushions and you can change your accent cushions whenever the mood strikes you seasonally or every couple of years

7209796 to reduce pressure on prices we need to increase the supply of oil especially oil produced here at home
7209797 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
7209798 democratic leaders know that these counterproductive proposals will not become law

7209802 fighting intensified overnight with battles raging near the towns of datu saudi ampatuan and datu piang all in maguindanao province
7209803 we have done our best to embrace peace but the milf started the hostilities by pillaging villages and murdering innocent civilians in mindanao
7209804 now we are implementing the full force of the law and we will arrest those responsible for the traitorous attacks against civilians
7209805 this is a grim scenario and i dont even want to think about it but if the peace talks collapse then there will be war again in mindanao
7209806 the voice of reason is dwarfed by the voice of hatred and prejudice
7209807 the peace talks are slowly breaking apart and if this continues may god help us all

7209813 i have not seen where robert burton has crossed the line

7209815 i see him as a person who got it right spiritually
7209816 hes in a position to be a guide for other people
7209817 no one has ever joined the fellowship because of the predictions
7209818 it was never the center of what we were doing
7209819 im very happy the civilization we know has not collapsed
7209820 relative to us it is divine relative to powers higher than himself he is not
7209821 has come to understand the esoteric nature of all spiritual teachings throughout recorded time
7209822 he has concluded that all religious traditions are the same and that the basis of all great spiritual work is the same to escape from imagination and the lower self and to awaken and recognize ones higher self
7209823 jesus said when he was 12 that he must be about his fathers business this does not refer to his age but to world 12 within him

7209830 the surgeon doing our wound healing trial remarked how an increase in collagen was helping to heal wounds
7209831 we wondered if it might work on fixing wrinkles and lines on the face so we had some copper woven pillows made up and noticed that over a few days of lying on a cooper pillow lines on the face started to soften

7209835 the host government has not lived up to its olympic promise that the media will be completely free to report on all aspects of china
7209836 as we feared the beijing olympic games have been a period conducive to arrests convictions censorship surveillance and harassment of more than 100 journalists bloggers and dissidents
7209837 should evolutionists be allowed to roam free in the land
7209838 hard line evolutionists spend their entire life declaring christians to be ignorant crazy and probably dangerous
7209839 thus evolutionist rhetoric juxtaposed against the facts of science and history demonstrates that they are totally incompetent in addition to being angry and dangerous in a truly sane society e g the one to be run by god evolutionists at a minimum would not be allowed to vote
7209840 evolutionism is the apologetic system of the end time religion
7209841 evolutionists should not be allowed to roam free in the land

7209844 stupid simple question easiest way to tweet a link from your iphone
7209845 ive been tested after every final session and a few preliminary sessions ive been doing tests since i got here and in singapore and at the training camp in palo alto calif
7209846 from the trials to now id say by a rough estimate theres been 40 tests thats a bunch but its part of the game and good for the sport to have it
7209847 ive been tested so many times in the competition ive lost count we know were good we know were clean we work hard and anytime you want to test us its ok
7209848 i know for me i am clean i did project believe with usada u s anti doping agency where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove it people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts and i have the results to prove it
7209849 i want to be absolutely clear we cant guarantee their cleanliness
7209850 for us going to play for 400 000 it was about the money
7209851 it helps your strength of schedule when it comes to making the fcs playoffs youre given more favorable treatment by the selection committee than if you play down
7209852 i think its just subject to whatever the market will bear there is no way to legislate against this type of escalation i think at some point it will move into the maintenance phase but the cost of doing business has become much steeper as it relates to having a one way opponent
7209853 weve got to help him out we as a unit meaning everybody weve got to help him out
7209854 a young guy coming in early in the week not knowing he was going to play then a few days later he finds out at the last second hes going to play and go the whole game as a unit weve got to help him out
7209855 we have to score touchdowns when we get the chance
7209856 field goals are not a bad thing but touchdowns are the goal
7209857 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
7209858 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down one day at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
7209859 well i know from our standpoint where it comes from is we played the national championship the last two years and havent been successful so is that fair i think thats fair we havent been successful should that paint a picture of our whole conference i dont think so but it also makes me feel a little disappointed that our performance in two championship games i guess brushes with a wider brush or whatever they say but i dont think its fair but what i think doesnt matter and what you think doesnt matter either
7209860 well if that happened again that means we were the big ten champions and i would never be disappointed about being the big ten champions i would be very proud of that
7209861 if we got to the game and didnt win it and didnt play as well as we were capable of playing or didnt prepare as well as we were capable obviously i would be disappointed in that so i guess that was a bad answer
7209862 youve just got to learn to figure out what each can do best and its hard to know exactly in practice
7209863 nonno peppe infatti nel 1901 fu nominato primo presidente della societ podistica lazio che ebbe poi come sede appunto la rondinella
7209864 underage drinkers are far less experienced to make good choices we should be protecting them said metro police chief ronal serpas
7209865 are told they are not mature enough to have a beer
7209866 presidents who would observe the word of law have only abstinence to fall back on to enforce a law thats unenforceable
7209867 the 21 age limit has not been very successful in reducing drinking it clearly isnt working because it is a message of prohibition and a reminder of prohibitions failure
7209868 alcohol is a reality in the lives of 18 19 and 20 year olds and most of the world has come out in a different place
7209869 for 24 years we have tried to change reality and preach abstinence only and for 24 years we have failed
7209870 that is just a monumental moment in the journey of african americans
7209871 if your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills
7209872 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7209873 today i have come back to springfield to tell you that ive found that leader a man with a distinguished record and a fundamental decency
7209874 joe biden is what so many others pretend to be a statesman with sound judgment who doesnt have to hide behind bluster to keep america strong
7209875 he has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters he is uniquely suited to be my partner as we work to put our country back on track
7209876 he has to make people more comfortable with him as a person
7209877 joe biden is a great american and typifies what the democratic party is all about making sure hardworking middle class americans
7209878 joe biden is a great american and typifies what the democratic party is all about making sure hardworking middle class americans get a fair chance he is a good choice that demonstrates how an obama administration will run he will use his solid experience to help guide the change america needs
7209879 the no 1 thing he brings to the ticket is foreign policy experience hes been in the senate for 30 years chaired the foreign relations committee and worked on these issues a long time he travels extensively and has very close relationships with a lot of the key leaders certainly in the whole israel palestine area in the middle east as well as pakistan and europe
7209880 i like joe biden many of us were hopeful that obamas selection would be sen hillary rodham clinton and thats disappointing but again not surprising
7209881 ive worked side by side with joe for 16 years in the u s senate and ive seen his dedication to americas families firsthand joe has always been willing to take on the tough fights and stand up for what is right even when its not always the popular thing to do joe biden spoke up for domestic violence protections for women when no one else was talking about it he fought for the armor our troops need and deserve to do their jobs safely in iraq and he has stood with me time and again to protect our veterans workers and children
7209882 i think compared to the others that we read were on sen obamas list gov tim kaine of virginia and indiana sen evan bayh i think that biden is probably better known nationally
7209883 i think democrats are excited about obama and excited about biden and we feel like we have a ticket that contrasts with george bush and john mccain biden voted for the war but then quickly became one of its most extreme critics and i think joe biden knows how many houses he owns
7209884 six months ago joe biden said barack obama was not ready to be president biden was right then hes right today and washington voters will realize hes right by the november election no vice presidential nominee can make up for obamas lack of experience and judgment especially one whose own words have documented the fact that obama is not ready to be president
7209885 this ends up being i think an incredible partnership and thats what a vice president is the vice president is one heartbeat away but the vice president does what the president of the united states wants to have done it will be a strong team and we will restore the respect of the world i think well be making much better moves overseas than we have made over the last eight years
7209886 i think its a great pick i think it will serve the democrats well in the campaign but more importantly it will serve the country well when hes vice president biden will make any folks who are still wavering probably more likely to get excited and inspired and charged up about sen obama
7209887 i was expecting actually a female maybe because of the hillary situation and i was very shocked that he chose joe biden kind of a rabbit out of a hat because joes been doing this for a long time and so i think its a good chance for joe as well as barack to join forces
7209888 biden just seems to be more of an authentic candidate someone who has kind of been through the mill he might add more experience and balance i just think that they might make a good team together
7209889 seems like a very vanilla safe choice sounds like john kerry all over again with john edwards what a terrible pick that was i would really have liked to see new mexico gov bill richardson if hed have chose richardson i would have voted for him
7209890 i think itll really help the balance will really help that was a good choice on his part go barack i love barack obama
7209891 i thought of hillary as vice president but id never thought of biden because id never heard of him before saturday so i have to start thinking about it now what hes about
7209892 is someone who wont give the neocons the time of the day
7209893 hes very pragmatic he studies a problem and tries to figure out what the interests are and where the solutions will be
7209894 i think it was built on a fundamental misreading of the situation on the ground
7209895 we were searching for what their common ground would be
7209896 this is a happy book a book written with love and profound gratitude to celebrate a man who has accomplished so much befriended so many and added to our small world of fly fishing a unique and enduring luster
7209897 hon dont worry about her shes been standing there for over an hour
7209898 shell head over to the tomatoes in a few minutes and do the same thing then you can grab what you want weve called the police to come attend to her

7209920 todav a sigue el enfrentamiento hemos atacado y destruido cerca de 40 b nkeres de milicianos y un campo de entrenamiento
7209921 tenemos informes confirmados de que 50 milicianos han muerto mientras 10 de nuestros soldados fueron hechos m rtires
7209922 no podemos huir por un lado est el toque de queda y por el otro los milicianos nos emplean como escudos humanos cuando nos atacan qu podemos hacer
7209923 the doctor said maybe i slept on my eye and i do sleep
7209924 i thought maybe if i got some blood flowing to my brain for once it would help but it didnt happen my first at bat i couldnt see the pitchers face was all blurry and it was even worse in the outfield numbers were blurry i used every eye drop in the clubhouse but it didnt work
7209925 he was throwing strikes thats encouraging to see from a guy that young
7209926 praticamente todas as pessoas que s o resgatadas das m fias dizem que a porque quiseram muito dif cil encontrar algu m que conte a verdade

7209929 he would have needed a lot of skill to get to the ball and he has it
7209930 but i thought the ball would get through the infield
7209931 i got off to a good start then i made two stupid plays in a row on 11 and 12
7209932 the one at 12 was one of the dumbest plays i ever made trying to do what i did out of the rough there from that point on it was a struggle to get in
7209933 the second mail was traced to a college in waghodia the mail was signed as indian mujahideen however its language did not match the previous mail which came minutes before the blast we were interested in the culprit as we wanted to know who was behind the prank in this mail also a wi fi connection was used
7209934 after the mail we have tightened security on campus we are working closely with city police officials to keep a check on the pranksters
7209935 we have kept our computer laboratories under surveillance after the threat mail
7209936 hes been the type of guy that has been plugging away
7209937 unfortunately he hasnt had the best couple of weeks but hes been a player in there working hard every single day so for him to come up with the big hit in the first inning definitely got us out in front and i think that was huge
7209938 they didnt tell me the real reason why im not going to be in the starting lineup
7209939 im assuming it has to do with trust and stuff like that
7209940 nothing has changed the fact that were trying to go out there and win games no matter who plays or who takes the first reps or whatever
7209941 i know my life is going to be a success and ill be happy no matter what i do
7209942 my life will be perfectly fine with or without football
7209943 after very healthy gains on wall st on friday at face value it looks like it will be a very good day for our market
7209944 but oil fell significantly and gold and base metals were down
7209945 the waxing and waning weve seen between the financials and resources is going to continue
7209946 more weakness in late september october is anticipated as the global economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue
7209947 i think the public is starting to focus a lot more on the crude oil price and that it is a major constituent of the petrol price
7209948 theres also more focus on the fact that the tax on petrol is over 50 cents a litre
7209949 we dont like to have more regulation in our industry theres a lot already
7209950 but overall the impact on our business we feel would be quite neutral whether it was in or out
7209951 i really think candace and sylvia those are the babies
7209952 sylvia did the running hook tonight that i showed her about five days ago for me its about passing the torch its a cliche but thats the way it is
7209953 i thought i was retired after 96 olympics gold in atlanta
7209954 they all told me stories about how when they were little they watched me and wanted to be like me and came to my camp and got my autograph
7209955 this team stands out from her other three olympic squads in my heart and mind
7209956 weve only been together one month and ive never seen a team become so selfless in such a short period of time before we got together i thought i hope theyre not about themselves how many points they score i couldnt have been more wrong
7209957 that was a good idea its a good way to get people out they say it makes it a little easier to throw some sliders in the dirt and let them swing at them it was just an all around good day
7209958 i simplified my delivery so much it feels the same between the stretch and the windup
7209959 before there was a big difference i was almost confusing myself between the stretch and the windup
7209960 i was happy to see frank get a few hits
7209961 we have a good team we showed that the first half
7209962 were going to face a good pitcher and well go out with a good game plan and try to beat him
7209963 instead of focusing on one guy worrying about being in the box covering tight ends i can just read the quarterback and make plays
7209964 it just kind of reminded me of who we are
7209965 now i see why none of the u s sprinters was chosen to carry the flag at opening ceremonies
7209966 shut up or well ship your dog to the chef at guolizhuang to be used for spare parts
7209967 is a wonderful flower that just opens up in these 17 days of the games
7209968 dear guests we wish that you enjoyed a pleasant time in beijing
7209969 im more disappointed to miss the opportunity to have people fired up about mountain biking back at home
7209970 they played perfectly to create this perfect ending for the pingpong competition at the beijing olympics i never dreamed it would be so easy
7209971 its easy to spin it however you want to its time for us to get behind this sport and talk about the good things
7209972 you could see the determination in her eyes to me and the rest of the staff we knew she was going to go for it
7209973 this sport here includes everybody in the world its an incredible competition i know people on the track were giving it their best its sport youre at the edge thats the beauty of the sport
7209974 i couldnt stop thinking about it its hard i worked for four years at least now i have something positive to think about i have to say it was good we won more medals on the womens side in how many years im really proud of the team and the fact we ended up on a high note
7209975 going into the relay we all came together as one
7209976 it wasnt about individuals it could have been a world record if it was a close race
7209977 i just didnt have the extra gear the last 200 meters
7209978 you try to go and its there or its not
7209979 its hard to explain i would have liked to be closer to a medal shot but it was a great experience its the best women in the world so i cant complain
7209980 i think i learned i should be in front i should keep myself in position
7209981 thats the best way to race i have a lot of races to go i cant be disappointed
7209982 pop to go with those girls when they made the move i couldnt go with it
7209983 its been such a completely crazy year everything is going to get easier from here on the olympic final is the most anxiety you can have if i can do this i can do anything
7209984 we have been to pancholis residence and his office his colleagues told us that he was looking worried before he left office on august 18 we also confirmed that his story that he was going to meet his father was a pretext his father himself went to the office to collect his belongings
7209985 it means that either he had intentionally switched it off or he was taken hostage between 1 30 and 3 pm on the day
7209986 the assailants worked hard to wipe out every trace of kunals identity he could be identified by his clothes tags and his rakhee
7209987 however the investigation is on and we cannot rule out any possibilities at the moment
7209988 the pika is the american wests canary in the coal mine
7209989 as temperatures rise pika populations at lower elevations are being driven to extinction pushing pikas further upslope until they have nowhere left to go
7209990 climate change is likely to drive a third of the worlds species to extinction worse its the species living on mountaintops which until now have been free from human impact that will be hardest hit
7209991 the american pika is an obvious example of such a species at considerable risk from climate change
7209992 not in the purview of the commission or department to effect
7209993 the california fish and game commissions attempt to bury its head in the sand rather than deal with the impact of global warming on wildlife is an embarrassment to our state which is a leader in climate policy
7209994 the commission is not allowed to abdicate its duty to protect californias plants animals and wild habitats and neither is the u s fish and wildlife service
7209995 i was definitely stressing it to myself just enjoy the moment
7209996 i never thought that this would be possible i wasnt even sure of my medal chances at all
7209997 ein gro teil der zeitverbesserung geht auf das konto unseres neuen dfi motors mit benzindirekteinspritzung aber auch beim setup des autos haben wir uns gegen ber 2007 stark verbessert obwohl ich fast drei zehntel schneller war als der beste acura wird es im rennen sicher sehr eng werden
7209998 wir haben gegen ende des qualifyings noch einmal eine ver nderung am auto vorgenommen die sich ausgezahlt hat
7209999 ich bin zuversichtlich dass wir das auto f r das rennen noch ein wenig schneller machen k nnen
